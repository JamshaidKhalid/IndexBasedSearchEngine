Democracy Magically Disappears", "content": "Following a vote by the Iraqi parliament to remove foreign troops from the nation , the US president threatened to destroy Iraq \u2019 s economy in retaliation and to refuse to leave unless an expensive military base worth billions of dollars was paid for .\n\u201c If they do ask us to leave , if we don \u2019 t do it in a very friendly basis , \u201d Trump told the press on Sunday .\n\u201c We will charge them sanctions like they \u2019 ve never seen before ever .\nIt \u2019 ll make Iranian sanctions look somewhat tame .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ that they do anything we think is inappropriate , we are going to put sanctions on Iraq , very big sanctions on Iraq.\n\u201d \u201c We have a very extraordinarily expensive air base that \u2019 s there .\nIt cost billions of dollars to build .\nLong before my time , \u201d Trump also said .\n\u201c We \u2019 re not leaving unless they pay us back for it.\n\u201d This would be the same President Trump whose starvation sanctions are already known to have killed tens of thousands of people in Venezuela @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nThe same President Trump who campaigned in 2016 on bringing the troops home from nations like Iraq .\nAnd this would be the same US empire that used the narrative of bringing democracy to Iraq in order to help manufacture public support for \u201c Operation Iraqi Freedom \u201d ( which Bush \u2019 s Press Secretary Ari Fleischer kept hilariously calling \u201c Operation Iraqi Liberation \u201d [ OIL ] by mistake ) .\nThe same US empire that has used the \u201c liberation \u201d of Iraq from the tyranny of Saddam Hussein and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ East to justify its evil and unforgivable invasion ever since .\nYet the instant Iraqi democratic institutions become even slightly inconvenient for the US empire , Iraqi democracy gets flushed down the toilet .\nIraq \u2019 s elected parliament voted very clearly for the removal of America \u2019 s military presence in the interests of its own sovereignty , and Trump has stated , in his typical accidentally-honest way , that America will not honor that vote .\nThe US is allowing Iraq the same kind of democracy that Americans have : democracy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inconvenience the powerful .\nThis is , of course , because the invasion of Iraq had nothing whatsoever to do with democracy .\nThe invasion of Iraq was about controlling a crucial geostrategic region which refused to bow to the dictates of the US-centralized empire .\nThis is important to remember , because that is also exactly what the regime change agendas against Iran and Syria are about .\nIt is not a mysterious coincidence that all these horrible dictatorships that urgently need a forceful injection of freedom and democracy just so happen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nThe fight for control over the Middle East has always been about controlling important fossil fuel resources and trade routes , and thereby controlling the world .\nIf the empire can \u2019 t gain control of the nations in the region via absorption into the imperial blob ( Saudi Arabia , UAE , Turkey , etc ) or just constructing a satellite from scratch on top of a previously existing nation ( Israel ) , then the empire will work to gain control by attempting to replace any noncompliant governments with compliant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) .\nAnd , as we now know , the second a compliant government begins to act noncompliant , it will immediately begin receiving the same treatment that noncompliant governments receive .\nAs things heat up with Iran you will begin hearing more and more babbling gibberish about the poor , poor Iranians and how unfortunate they are to live in a nation where the women can \u2019 t feel their hair in the wind and LGBT people need to hide who they are .\nBut as a leaked State Department memo revealed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ actually concerned with human rights , and it is never actually concerned with democracy .\nThe sole concern of the empire is power , and the growth of that power .\nThat \u2019 s all this has ever been about .\nIraq seems to be destined to be the nation that keeps teaching us important lessons , so the very least we can do in response is make sure that we learn those lessons , and remember them .\nThanks for reading !\nThe best way to get around the internet censors and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ publish is to subscribe to the

Bush , Bill Clinton : they all have done their part to ensure that the military industrial complex can continue to get rich at taxpayer expense .\nDespite numerous campaign promises to stop America \u2019 s \u201c endless wars , \u201d once elected , Trump has done a complete about-face , deploying greater numbers of troops to the Middle East , ramping up the war rhetoric , and padding the pockets of defense contractors .\nIndeed , Trump is even refusing to withdraw U.S. troops from Iraq @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Iraqi government for us to leave .\nObama was no different : he also pledged\u2014if elected\u2014to bring the troops home from Iraq and Afghanistan and reduce America \u2019 s oversized , and overly costly , military footprint in the world .\nOf course , that didn \u2019 t happen .\nYet while the rationale may keep changing for why American military forces are policing the globe , these wars abroad ( in Iraq , Afghanistan , Pakistan , Syria , Yemen and now Iran ) aren \u2019 t making America\u2014or the rest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not making America great again , and are undeniably digging the U.S. deeper into debt .\nAlthough the U.S. constitutes only 5 % of the world \u2019 s population , America boasts almost 50 % of the world \u2019 s total military expenditure , spending more on the military than the next 19 biggest spending nations combined .\nIn fact , the Pentagon spends more on war than all 50 states combined spend on health , education , welfare , and safety .\nThe American military-industrial complex has erected an empire unsurpassed in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one dedicated to conducting perpetual warfare throughout the earth .\nSince 2001 , the U.S. government has spent more than $ 4.7 trillion waging its endless wars .\nHaving been co-opted by greedy defense contractors , corrupt politicians and incompetent government officials , America \u2019 s expanding military empire is bleeding the country dry at a rate of more than $ 32 million per hour .\nIn fact , the U.S. government has spent more money every five seconds in Iraq than the average American earns in a year .\nFuture wars and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expected to push the total bill upwards of $ 12 trillion by 2053 .\nTalk about fiscally irresponsible : the U.S. government is spending money it doesn \u2019 t have on a military empire it can \u2019 t afford .\nAs investigative journalist Uri Friedman puts it , for more than 15 years now , the United States has been fighting terrorism with a credit card , \u201c essentially bankrolling the wars with debt , in the form of purchases of U.S. Treasury bonds by U.S.-based entities like pension funds and state and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ China and Japan.\n\u201d War is not cheap , but it becomes outrageously costly when you factor in government incompetence , fraud , and greedy contractors .\nIndeed , a leading accounting firm concluded that one of the Pentagon \u2019 s largest agencies \u201c can \u2019 t account for hundreds of millions of dollars \u2019 worth of spending.\n\u201d Unfortunately , the outlook isn \u2019 t much better for the spending that can be tracked .\nA government audit found that defense contractor Boeing has been massively overcharging taxpayers for mundane parts , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in overspending .\nAs the report noted , the American taxpayer paid : That price gouging has become an accepted form of corruption within the American military empire is a sad statement on how little control \u201c we the people \u201d have over our runaway government .\nMind you , this isn \u2019 t just corrupt behavior .\nIt \u2019 s deadly , downright immoral behavior .\nAmericans have thus far allowed themselves to be spoon-fed a steady diet of pro-war propaganda that keeps them content to wave flags with patriotic fervor and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the mounting body counts , the ruined lives , the ravaged countries , the blowback arising from ill-advised targeted-drone killings and bombing campaigns in foreign lands , or the transformation of our own homeland into a warzone .\nThat needs to change .\nThe U.S. government is not making the world any safer .\nIt \u2019 s making the world more dangerous .\nIt is estimated that the U.S. military drops a bomb somewhere in the world every 12 minutes .\nSince 9/11 , the United States government has directly contributed to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Every one of those deaths was paid for with taxpayer funds .\nThe U.S. government is not making America any safer .\nIt \u2019 s exposing American citizens to alarming levels of blowback , a CIA term referring to the unintended

global economy would result in devastating blowback .\nThe 9/11 attacks were blowback .\nThe Boston Marathon Bombing was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was blowback .\nThe Fort Hood shooter , a major in the U.S. Army , was blowback .\nThe assassination of Iranian General Qasem Soleimani by a U.S. military drone strike will , I fear , spur yet more blowback against the American people .\nThe war hawks \u2019

binoculars , etc . )\nand handing them over to local police @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also blowback .\nJames Madison was right : \u201c No nation could preserve its freedom in the midst of continual warfare.\n\u201d As Madison explained , \u201c Of all the enemies to public liberty war is , perhaps , the most to be dreaded because it comprises and develops the germ of every other .\nWar is the parent of armies ; from these proceed debts and taxes\u2026 known instruments for bringing the many under the domination of the few.\n\u201d We are seeing this play out before our eyes .\nThe government @ @ @ @ @ @ @ national infrastructure through neglect and a lack of resources , and turning taxpayer dollars into blood money with its endless wars , drone strikes and mounting death tolls .\nClearly , our national priorities are in desperate need of an overhauling .\nAt the height of its power , even the mighty Roman Empire could not stare down a collapsing economy and a burgeoning military .\nProlonged periods of war and false economic prosperity largely led to its demise .\nAs historian Chalmers Johnson predicts : This is the \u201c unwarranted influence , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ military-industrial complex \u201d that President Dwight Eisenhower warned us more than 50 years ago not to let endanger our liberties or democratic processes .\nEisenhower , who served as Supreme Commander of the Allied forces in Europe during World War II , was alarmed by the rise of the profit-driven war machine that emerged following the war\u2014one that , in order to perpetuate itself , would have to keep waging war .\nWe failed to heed his warning .\nAs I make clear in my book Battlefield America : The War on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much time left before we reach the zero hour .\nIt

communicating with friends and applying for social services , to studying and working \u2014 staying connected is no longer a luxury but a necessity .\nIn this context , internet shutdowns have evolved into a human rights issue with the power to severely disrupt people \u2019 s lives .\nApart from the documented negative economic impacts , intentional internet shutdowns can be weaponized to silence dissent and stunt protest movements .\nHowever , internet shutdowns are on the rise with 196 intentional internet disruptions recorded in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Voices covered internet shutdowns in Zimbabwe , Myanmar , Mauritania , Ethiopia , Iraq , and Ecuador to name a few .\nNow more than ever it is vital for internet users to understand the different vocabulary being used to describe different types of internet disruptions and how they work .\nOne or all of the following tactics can be used to intentionally disrupt the internet .\nBandwidth is defined as \u201c a measurement of the amount of information that can be sent between computers , through a phone line , etc.\n\u201d @ @ @ @ @ @ @ send data ( like a video or an image file ) faster than a low bandwidth connection .\nBandwidth throttling refers to the intentional limitation of bandwidth which can be translated into a limitation on the speed with which a set amount of data can move .\nOne of the ways this can happen is when an Internet Service Provider ( ISP ) intentionally slows down internet service ( at the request of a government body ) making the connection so slow it is basically unusable .\nThis can happen on a network-wide @ @ @ @ @ @ @ specific apps and websites .\nThis tactic is often used to prevent the spread of videos , photos or audio files as these require higher bandwidth to share .\nAccording to Access Now \u2019 s 2018 # KeepItOn Report , \u201c throttling is much harder to verify than other forms of shutdowns \u201d .\nThis is because , in areas where internet infrastructure is not well developed , people may confuse intentional throttling with the technical difficulties they frequently face .\nThe use of throttling has been covered by Global Voices in different @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Other shutdowns take the form of platform-specific blocking also known as \u201c content blocking \u201d or \u201c partial shutdowns \u201d .\nSites and apps like Instagram , Telegram , WhatsApp , Twitter and Facebook can be targeted while other websites are still available for use .\nIn some countries where platforms like Facebook are synonymous with the internet itself , platform-specific blocking severely limits access to the internet .\nPlatform-specific blocking has become more common during moments of civil unrest and elections as a means to prevent large-scale protest organization .\nAccording to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Iraq , multiple ISPs blocked access to Facebook , Twitter , WhatsApp , Instagram and other social media and messaging apps .\nMany governments claim that these blocking tactics are a method to prevent the spread of misinformation and to quell the possibility of violence .\nIn 2019 , Global Voices reported on cases of platform-specific blocking in Venezuela , Turkey , Ecuador , Iraq and more .\nThe most drastic of all the internet disruption tactics is a complete internet shutdown also known as a \u201c blanket shutdown \u201d , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blackout \u201d .\nWhile the previously mentioned tactics still allow people to access the internet , albeit in a limited fashion , internet blackouts mean that connection to the internet is cut .\nThis can happen unintentionally when there is damage to undersea telecommunication cables , but it is most common when governments turn it off intentionally .\nWhen this happens , governments work with service providers to shut down access to all forms of internet connection making digital security tools that are usually effective at bypassing internet blocks , like Virtual Private @ @ @ @ @ @ @ However , internet infrastructure is designed to be decentralized so completely shutting down the internet is a very complex task if not currently impossible .\nDuring what is commonly known as a blanket shutdown , the internet is often still available for a limited sector of the population such as government officials .\nBlanket shutdowns began to gain notoriety when the Egyptian government cut off access to the internet during political protests in 2011 .\nSince then , blanket shutdowns have been employed in many countries including India , Chad , Indonesia , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ does the future hold ?\nAs the number of internet shutdowns continues to grow , civil society organizations are sounding the alarm and using their collective power to demand that governments view access to the internet as a fundamental human right .\nIn Uganda , several organizations penned a letter to the African Union asking them to condemn Uganda \u2019 s 2016 decision to shut down the internet .\nIn early December 2019 , civil society groups from Indonesia sued the Indonesian government for enforcing an internet shutdown in the Papua and West @ @ @ @ @ @ @ protests .\nHowever , despite valiant efforts on the

Bush and Obama to increase tensions with Iran had fizzled .\nAmericans were showing signs of fatigue , FINALLY fed up with the lies being constructed to trick @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wars .\nTrump was a breath of fresh air\u2026but of course , like all other puppets of the globalists , his promises were empty .\nIn my article \u2018 Clinton vs. Trump And The Co-Option Of The Liberty Movement \u2019 , published before the 2016 election , I warned that Trump \u2019 s rhetoric might be a grand show , and that it could be scripted by the establishment to bring conservatives back into the Republican/Neo-Con fold .\nAt the time , leftist media outlet Bloomberg openly reveled in the idea that Trump @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Party \u201d and liberty movement and turn them into something far more manageable .\nThe question was whether or not the liberty movement would buy into Trump completely , or remain skeptical .\nInitially , I do not think the movement held onto its objectivity at all .\nFar too many people bought into Trump blindly and immediately based on misguided hopes and a desire to \u201c win \u201d against the leftists .\nThe insane cultism of the political left didn \u2019 t help matters much , either .\nWhen Trump started saturating @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the CFR the moment he entered office , I knew without any doubt that he was a fraud .\nClose associations with establishment swamp creatures was something he had consistently criticized Clinton and other politicians for during the campaign , but Trump was no better or different than Clinton ; he was just an errand boy for the elites .\nThe singular difference was that his rhetoric was designed to appeal directly to liberty minded conservatives .\nThis meant that it was only a matter of time before Trump broke most of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that he would bring US troops home .\nEventually , the mask had to come off if Trump was going to continue carrying out the agenda of his masters .\nToday , the mask has indeed come off .\nFor the past three years Trump has made announcements of an imminent pullback of troops in the Middle East , including the recent claim that troops would be leaving Syria .\nAll of the announcements were followed by an INCREASE in US troop presence in the region .\nConsistent attempts have been made to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ build-up to war has been obvious , but some people on the Trump train still didn \u2019 t get it .\nThe most common argument I heard when pointing out all the inconsistencies in Trump \u2019 s claims as well as his direct links to globalists was that \u201c He hadn \u2019 t started any wars , so how could he be a globalist puppet\u2026 ?\n\u201d My response has always been \u201c Give it a little time , and he will.\n\u201d One of my readers noted recently that \u201c Trump Derangement @ @ @ @ @ @ @ both ways .\nLeftists double down on their hatred of Trump at every opportunity , but Trump cultists double down on their support for Trump regardless of how many promises he breaks .\nThis has always been my biggest concern \u2013 That conservatives in the liberty movement would ultimately abandon their principles of limited government , the end to banking elites in the White House and ending illegal wars because they had invested themselves so completely in the Trump farce that they would be too embarrassed to admit they had been conned .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ would be infected by an influx of people who are neo-conservative statists at their core .\nThese people pretend to be liberty minded conservatives , but when the veil is lifted they show their true colors as the War Pigs they really are .\nA distinction has to be made between Bush era Neo-Con control freaks and constitutional conservatives ; there are few if any similarities between the two groups , but the establishment hopes that the former will devour the latter .\nI \u2019 ve noticed that the War Pigs are out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their chests a calling for more blood .\nThe US government has assassinated Iranian military commander Qasem Soleimani , retaliations against US targets have begun , and now the Iraqi government has demanded that US troops be removed from the region , to which Trump has said \u201c no \u201d and demanded payment instead .\nA new troop surge has been initiated and this WILL end in all-out war .\nThe tit-for-tat has just begun .\nHow do Trump cultists respond ?\n\u201c Kill those terrorists !\n\u201d Yes , many of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ supposed opposition to the wars three years ago are now fanatically cheering for the beginning of perhaps the most destructive war of all .\nThe rationalizations for this abound .\nSoleimani was planning attacks on US targets in Iraq , they say .\nAnd , this might be true , though no hard proof has yet been presented .\nI \u2019 m reminded of the Bush era claims of Iraqi \u201c Weapons of Mass Destruction \u201d , the weapons that were never found and no proof was found that they ever existed .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ weapons the US sold to them decades ago .\nAny government can fabricate an excuse for assassination or war for public consumption ; the Trump Administration is no different .\nThat said , I think the most important factor in this debate has fallen by the wayside .\nThe bottom line is , US troops and US bases should NOT be in Iraq in the first place .\nTrump himself stated this time and time again .\nEven if Soleimani was behind the attacks and riots in Iraq , US assets can not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are REMOVED from the region as Trump said he would do .\nThere is only one reason to keep US assets in Iraq , Afghanistan or Syria at this time , and that is to create ongoing tensions in the area which can be used by the establishment to trigger a new war , specifically with Iran .\nThe War Pigs always have reasons and rationales , though .\nThey say the Muslim world is a threat to our way of life , and I agree that their ideology is completely incompatible with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ solution is not sending young Americans to die overseas in wars based on lies .\nAgain , these wars only benefit the bankers and globalists ; they do not make us safer as a people .\nThe only moral solution is to make sure the fascist elements of Muslim extremism are not imported to our shores .\nThe War Pigs say that we deserve payment for our \u201c services rendered \u201d in the region before we leave , echoing the sentiments of Donald Trump .\nI ask , what services ?\nPayment for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u2019 t want , based on fallacies that have been publicly exposed ?\nThe US bases that should not be there in the first place ?\nThe hundreds of thousands dead from a war that had no purpose except to deliberately destabilize the region ?\nWe will never get \u201c payment \u201d from the Iraqis as compensation for these mad endeavors , and the War Pigs know this .\nThey want war .\nThey want it to go on forever .\nThey want to attach their egos to the event .\nThey want @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we win , and they want to claim victimhood for themselves vicariously when our soldiers or citizens get killed .\nThey are losers that can only be winners through the sacrifices of others .\nThe War Pigs defend the notion that the president should be allowed to make war unilaterally without support from congress .\nThey say that this type of action is legal , and technically they are right .\nIt is \u201c legal \u201d because the checks and balances of war were removed under the Bush and Obama Administrations .\nThe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Use Of Military Force ) in 2001 gave the Executive Branch dictatorial powers to initiate war on a whim without oversight .\nJust because it is \u201c legal \u201d does not mean it is constitutional , or right .\nIn the end , the Trump bandwagon is meant to accomplish many things for the globalists ; the main goal though is that it is designed to change liberty conservatives into rabid statists .\nIt is designed to make anti-war pro-constitution activists into war mongers and supporters of big government , as long as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ control \u201d .\nBut it \u2019 s not under our control .\nTrump is NOT our guy .\nHe is an agent of the establishment and always has been .\nFor now , the saber rattling is aggressive but the actions have been limited , but this will not be the case for long .\nSome may ask why the establishment has not simply launched all out war now ?\nWhy start out small ?\nFirstly , they need conservatives psychologically invested in the idea .\nThis may require a false flag event @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , they need to execute an extensive troop build-up , which could take a few months .\nDeclarations of a \u201c need for peace \u201d are always used to stall for time while the elites position for war .\nWar with Iran is pointless , and frankly , unwinnable , and the elites know this .\nIt \u2019 s not just a war with Iran , it is a war with Iran , their allies , and every other nation that reacts negatively to our actions .\nAnd , these nations do not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ react economically by dumping US treasuries and the dollar as world reserve .\nThe establishment wants the US embroiled in Afghanistan , Iraq , Iran , etc .\nuntil we are so hollowed out from conflict that we collapse .\nThey also need a considerable distraction to hide their responsibility for the implosion of the Everything Bubble and the economic pain that will come with it .\nThe end game for the establishment is for America to self destruct , so that it can be rebuilt into something unrecognizable and eternally monstrous .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ principles to be erased , and to do that , they need us to be complicit in our own destruction .\nThey need us to participate .\nDon \u2019 t participate , and refuse to support new banker wars

A new Hawaii law that decriminalizes marijuana possession and creates a process to expunge the records of certain marijuana offenders is now in effect .\nThe new law takes another step toward nullifying federal cannabis prohibition in effect in the state .\nTwenty Democratic representatives sponsored House Bill 1383 ( HB1383 ) .\nThe new law decriminalizes possession of three grams or less of marijuana making it similar to a traffic violation punishable by a fine of $ 130 .\nThe bill also creates a process allowing individuals convicted of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ less to have those convictions expunged from their criminal records .\nFinally , HB1383 establishes a marijuana evaluation task force to make recommendations on changing marijuana use penalties and outcomes in the state .\nThe House passed HB1383 by a 35-16 vote .\nThe Senate approved the measure 22-3 .\nGov .\nDavid Ige didn \u2019 t sign or veto the bill within his allotted timeframe and it became law on July 10 without his signature .\nIt went into effect Jan. 1 , 2020 .\nEnactment of HB1383 not only loosens marijuana @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prior marijuana convictions on their record get a new start ; it will also further undermine federal marijuana prohibition .\nAs marijuana becomes more accepted and more states simply ignore the feds , the federal government is less able to enforce its unconstitutional laws .\nUnder the federal Controlled Substances Act ( CSA ) passed in 1970 , the federal government maintains complete prohibition of marijuana .\nOf course , the federal government lacks any constitutional authority to ban or regulate cannabis within the borders of a state , despite the opinion of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Court .\nIf you doubt this , ask yourself why it took a constitutional amendment to institute federal alcohol prohibition .\nDecriminalization , along with Hawaii \u2019 s medical marijuana program , removed a layer of laws prohibiting the possession and use of cannabis in the state , but federal prohibition remains in place .\nThis is significant because FBI statistics show that law enforcement makes approximately 99 of 100 marijuana arrests under state , not federal law .\nWhen states stop enforcing marijuana laws , they sweep away most of the basis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The CBD Health Revolution is online and FREE from January 13-19 , 2020 .\nSign up HERE Furthermore , figures

include the cost of prosecution .\nThe lesson ?\nThe feds lack the resources to enforce marijuana prohibition without state assistance .\nHB1383 further undermines prohibition make it that much more difficult for the federal government @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of HB1383 ignores federal prohibition and continues the process of nullifying it in practice in Hawaii .\nColorado , Washington state , Oregon and Alaska were the first states to legalize recreational cannabis , and California , Nevada , Maine and Massachusetts joined them after ballot initiatives in favor of legalization passed in November 2016 .\nMichigan followed suit when voters legalized cannabis for general use in 2018 .\nVermont became the first state to legalize marijuana through a legislative act in 2018 .\nIllinois followed suit in 2019 .\nWith 33 states @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the feds find themselves in a position where they simply can \u2019 t enforce prohibition anymore .\n\u201c The lesson here is pretty straightforward .\nWhen

the aggressive tightening in 2018 \u2013 were one of the primary reasons that the stock market soared by so much .\nOn multiple occasions throughout 2019 , stocks hit new all-time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this really intensified and reached historic rally levels .\nStocks were green almost on a daily basis .\nThe FED \u2019 s balance sheet expansion is one of the major catalysts , as well as the pro-growth Phase 1 deal that China and the U.S. signed yesterday for the willingness of buyers to pay higher prices .\nThe result is that the stock market is now the most expensive ever , as far as price/sales ratio goes : This isn \u2019 t a good sign for stocks , nor for the economy , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ means that these artificially-low interest rates are causing investment firms to purchase stocks , even though they don \u2019 t really want to , as well as prompting CFOs to issue large buyback programs over spending funds on machinery , research and growth .\nThe lack of viable alternatives for the trillions of dollars in managed money is creating a situation in which fund managers are acting out of necessity , not out of pure reasoning .\nWarren Buffett , who isn \u2019 t under any pressure to make any moves , has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which will surely serve shareholders when the time comes to buy big .\nAs you can see , the FED is not trigger-shy on its unofficial QE4 plan .\nEveryone \u2019 s been focused on this monetary easing , but the Trump administration is preparing a tsunami of fiscal stimulus in the form of another round of tax cuts for the middle class and lower-income demographics \u2013 and they plan to roll it out in 2020 !\nThis means that , on top of the already $ 1.1T deficit , tax receipts are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ economic engine , the boom in the markets , the low unemployment rate , the confidence of consumers ; all of these are what Trump is banking on to get re-elected .\nIt seems Trump is looking to make all voters know , right around the time of elections

is a whole other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ took another step towards the Senate , when the House voted to advance the two articles of impeachment to trial .\nIt \u2019 s coming and it \u2019 s happening during an election year .\nThis is a very unique time in American politics , to say the least .\nThere are many moving parts here and it will be truly fascinating to see how the public reacts and follows these issues , at the same time as the Phase 1 deal taking effect and with the president \u2019 s economic advisor , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as I see it , a Tax Cut 2.0 later this year .\nAs you can see , Goldman

front or backlash from the rollback of Repurchase Operations by liquidity-addicted investors .\nYou can truly notice the elevated risk appetite , when you look at the low yields that investors are willing to accept when lending money @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u2019 s clear to see that people are FEELING GOOD , in general .\nInvestors have their guards down and their radars turned off for Black Swan scenarios .\nThis doesn \u2019 t mean that anything imminent is coming , but what it does tell you is that most investors are willing to pay top dollar for their stocks .\nIt \u2019 s a good

Oppositional Journalism Continues To Escalate", "content": "Journalist Glenn Greenwald has been charged by the Bolsonaro government in Brazil with the same prosecutorial angle used by the US to target WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange .\nPer The New York Times : Citing intercepted messages between Mr. Greenwald and the hackers , prosecutors say the journalist played a \u201c clear role in facilitating the commission of a crime.\n\u201d For instance , prosecutors contend that Mr. Greenwald encouraged the hackers to delete archives that had already been shared with The Intercept Brasil , in order to cover their tracks .\nProsecutors also say that Mr. Greenwald was communicating @ @ @ @ @ @ @ monitoring private chats on Telegram , a messaging app .\nThe complaint charged six other individuals , including four who were detained last year in connection with the cellphone hacking .\nThis argument is essentially indistinguishable from the argument currently being used by the Trump administration in charging Assange with 17 counts of violating the Espionage Act .\nThe US Department of Justice alleges that Assange attempted to provide Private Manning with advice and assistance in covering her tracks while leaking documents she already had access to , therefore making Assange party to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It is not surprising that Brazil is advancing the same war on journalism we \u2019 ve been seeing in the US , UK , Australia and France .\nWith the election of the overtly fascist Jair Bolsonaro in October 2018 ( an election whose corrupt foundations were exposed by Greenwald \u2019 s reporting with The Intercept Brasil ) , the Brazilian government moved into full alignment with the the US-centralized empire , which was why his inauguration was enthusiastically celebrated by characters like Donald Trump , Mike Pompeo , John Bolton and Benjamin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we saw a coordination between the US , UK , Sweden , Ecuador and Australia to immobilize , and then silence , and then imprison Julian Assange , we are seeing a uniform movement toward silencing oppositional journalism throughout the entire US-centralized empire .\nThis is because a rising China and the increasing coziness of the cluster of nations which have resisted absorption into the imperial blob greatly imperil the USA \u2019 s position as the unipolar global dominator , meaning that the empire needs to quickly shore up global control in order @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other power structures .\nIn order to accomplish this there \u2019 s going to have to be a lot of nefarious behavior .\nA lot of military escalations , a lot of CIA coups , a lot of bullying and subversion , and a whole lot of propaganda to grease the wheels of public consent .\nSuch large , frantic , flailing movements can be easily exposed by a free press , which is precisely why the free press is being clamped down upon now .\nThe empire is setting all these legal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ intends to use those precedents in the future .\nIt fully intends to use those legal precedents in the future because it knows it \u2019 s going to have to make things ugly .\nThis is all being done to prevent the public from gaining a clear understanding of what \u2019 s really going on in their world , because if the public had a clear understanding of what \u2019 s going on in their world , the empire would forever lose its ability to control them and rule them .\nWhoever controls @ @ @ @ @ @ @ imperialists understand this .\nThe public , by and large , do not .\nAnd the imperialists intend to keep it that way .\nGlenn Greenwald has spent the last three years being falsely smeared as a stooge of authoritarian governments while he was actually doing more damage to an authoritarian government than all of his critics combined .\nPublic trust in oppressive institutions ( like the oppressive institutions that empire loyalists have been protecting by smearing Greenwald as a Kremlin agent and a Putin puppet ) can be severely weakened by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ light of truth .\nThe imperialists know this , and they are determined not to allow it to continue .\nHence their persecution of Assange , and hence their

killers , we have an official @ @ @ @ @ @ @ big one.\n\u201d Millions of people could fall ill and die .\nIn each case , there are travelers .\n\u201c People returning from X have the virus and they are spreading it.\n\u201d In the case of SARS and Swine Flu , the patients \u2019 symptoms were typical \u201c flu \u201d symptoms : fever , fatigue , cough , weakness .\nIn other words , there was no reason to think the \u201c new disease \u201d was any different from ordinary traditional illness .\nThe big and only difference is the claim @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as the cause of illness .\nBut in each case , there are serious problems with that claim .\nFirst , only \u201c official researchers \u201d are involved with the \u201c discovery \u201d of the new virus .\nThere is no confirmation from independent researchers .\nFor example , in the case of SARS ( 2003 ) , ten labs belonging to the World Health Organization ( WHO ) performed the \u201c discovery \u201d of that coronavirus .\nThey were connected through closed circuit\u2014no outsiders allowed .\nEventually , a Canadian biologist working @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the press he was quite puzzled by what he was seeing : more and more SARS patients didn \u2019 t have the SARS virus at all .\nIn fact , almost no new SARS patients had the virus .\nWell , when you stop and think about that ridiculous state of affairs , you realize you can \u2019 t say a person , with ordinary flu-like symptoms , is suffering from a new disease if he doesn \u2019 t have the cause of that disease .\nBut the mainstream press took no notice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the case of the Swine Flu \u201c epidemic \u201d ( 2009 ) , the US Centers for Disease Control ( CDC ) was reporting thousands of cases in America\u2014but CBS star reporter Sharyl Attkisson found out that the CDC had , mysteriously , stopped counting cases .\nHow could this be ?\nShe came up with the devastating answer .\nThe overwhelming percentage of blood tests on Swine Flu patients were coming back from labs with no sign of the Swine Flu virus or any other flu virus .\nThat story ran on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Attkisson told me in an interview , the bosses at CBS wouldn \u2019 t allow it on the national television news broadcast .\nCensored .\nAnd that was the end of the CBS exposure of the Swine Flu hoax .\nYet , as I reported : about three weeks after CBS shut down the story , WebMD ran a piece in which the CDC estimated there were 22 MILLION cases of Swine Flu in the US .\nIf your head is spinning , it should be .\nThe second major problem with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or an epidemic is the absence of research on what we could call the \u201c infection factor.\n\u201d Let me explain .\nTo even begin to say a particular germ is causing a particular disease , you have to prove the germ is present in a patient \u2019 s body IN GREAT NUMBERS .\nA few little viral particles floating around here and there are irrelevant .\nYou need millions .\nSo if an ignorant doctor or a researcher states , \u201c Well , this patient has the coronavirus so he has the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ far short of proving anything useful .\nWhere are the tests proving the patient has millions of the virus in his body ?\nNowhere .\nThe third major problem with the announcement of a \u201c new disease \u201d or an epidemic is the \u201c test factor.\n\u201d What test is being run on a patient to prove he has the \u201c new virus \u201d in his body ?\nMost of the time , it is an antibody test .\nStay with me here , this is important .\nPrior to 1984 , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ test was a good outcome .\nIn short , it indicated that the patient \u2019 s immune system had come in contact with a germ and successfully defeated it .\nBut then , for several reasons , this science was turned on its head .\nA positive antibody test , from that time on , was evidence that the patient currently had the disease in question .\nBoom .\nNow , disease numbers could easily be inflated .\nAnd they were .\nAnd they are .\nAutomatically assuming that the announcement of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ s a major mistake , to say the least .\nThe CDC and WHO are operated by virus hunters .\nRunning a new virus up the flagpole is their stock in trade .\nThey rush to an area where an \u201c outbreak \u201d has been announced , and they roll up their sleeves and look for the virus .\nThey pay no attention to environmental factors , such as contaminated water supplies or toxic chemicals or malnutrition or lack of basic sanitation .\nEpidemics are good for business .\nPharmaceutical business , inducing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , diverting the public from key events business , surveillance and quarantine business , and so on .\nI \u2019 m sure , at some point , there will be THANK YOU , CHINA , BUSINESS , too .\nThank you , China , for

Would Defuse the State\u2019s Conflict over Guns", "content": "Earlier this month , West Virginia state senator Charles Trump introduced a senate resolution requesting that the citizens of Frederick County consider joining West Virginia .\nThat is , the West Virginia Senate invited the county to secede from Virginia and join West Virginia .\nThe Senate later adopted the resolution .\nResolutions like these don \u2019 t change any laws , but the Senate vote was in part a response to the dissatisfaction voiced by some Virginians over the legislative agenda of the new government in Richmond .\nAs Tho Bishop noted on Monday here at Mises.org , many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of other counties outside Democrat-controlled areas of the state \u2019 s east and northeast , are concerned about mounting efforts by the state government to impose new gun ownership restrictions\u2014among other new regulations\u2014on Virginia residents .\nIf opponents of the current ideological winds blowing in Virginia find themselves in a permanent minority , it may very well be that the only method of defending the minority position is by leaving the state .\nBut \u201c exit \u201d can theoretically be obtained in more than one way .\nIt can be done on an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a single person relocates .\nOr it can be done through jurisdictional secession .\nIn the case of Virginia , there would be nothing novel about some parts of the state breaking off from the Richmond-controlled government .\nThe same thing happened during and after the American Civil War .\nAt the time , the mountain South was less inclined to support slavery\u2014and more inclined to be Unionist\u2014than plantation areas .\nThis was true for mountain areas of Virginia as well .\nNorthern politicians took advantage of this split and promised independence \u2014 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ western counties of Virginia\u2014if they would break away from the Virginia government controlled by wealthy planters .\nAlthough the process by which this happened was legally sketchy , the US Supreme Court nonetheless put its stamp of approval on West Virginia \u2019 s secession in 1871 .\nThere are practical obstacles to secession , to be sure .\nBusinesses would be subject to different regulations , and the criminal code would be slightly different for county residents as the county switched to a new state .\nState budgets would have to be changed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ law , of course , would remain unchanged in all areas , and matters of global diplomacy would be virtually unaffected .\nCongress \u2019 s involvement need not extend much beyond the apportioning of members of Congress once the next decennial census comes along .\nUnfortunately , status quo bias would cause many to emotionally reject any change .\nThe way things have \u201c always \u201d been done will be trotted out as justification for keeping things the way they are , essentially forever .\nBut is there a moral argument against secession @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ideas of self-determination and human rights seriously .\nIf minority groups find themselves perennially in the minority , what recourse do they have if boundaries are also permanently fixed ?\nSome might suggest these people can move across state lines .\nBut since state lines could be hundreds of miles away in a large state like Virginia , a forced diaspora would likely require minority populations to disband their communities .\nSome suggests members of the minority ought to trust the court system to protect their rights .\nBut American history is littered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ courts either refuse to take action , or explicitly side with governments against the rights of citizens .\nEven if court decisions go the minority \u2019 s way in the short term , there \u2019 s no fighting the majority in the long term .\nAfter all , judges are not immune from the currents of ideological change as imposed by majority groups \u2014 and the law schools they control .\nThus , as economist and social theorist Ludwig von Mises noted in his 1927 book Liberalism : Writing in the decades following @ @ @ @ @ @ @ boundaries were being redrawn along ethnic lines \u2014 Mises was acutely aware of the problems that presented minority communities who found themselves in larger jurisdictions controlled by groups who differed in their backgrounds and ideologies .\nWhen it came to protecting their rights , minority groups could not simply place their trust in the next election , or in the hands of government judges , and hope for the best .\nOften , the most peaceful and reliable strategy was to redraw borders so that minority communities might ally with other sympathetic groups @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over time , populations and ideologies change in various times and places .\nPeople migrate and culture changes .\nMajorities can be turned into minorities , and vice versa .\nThis , Mises recognized , nonetheless does not render the legal and property rights of the minority groups null and void .\nCommunities are still entitled to the right of self-determination , even when in the minority .\nStrategies must therefore be adopted to protect these minority groups .\nOne of the most practical strategies , Mises understood , was changing borders of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the populations within those borders .\nAs Mises noted , to force members of conflicting groups to live side by side within a single jurisdiction is problematic to say the least .\nIt only encourages each side to become ever more fanatical in its drive to gain control of the machinery of government so as to oppress the other side .\nThis is why Mises presented his plan as a means of avoiding violence : increasingly intense competition over centralized institutions of political power tends to lead to violence in the long term @ @ @ @ @ @ @ secession .\nConversely , the potential for violence is minimized by minimizing the state \u2019 s power .\nIn the presence of a mostly laissez-faire government , neither side has much reason to worry about who controls the state .\nBut the stakes climb ever higher as the state gains more power over peoples \u2019 lives .\nBut \u201c minimizing state power \u201d certainly isn \u2019 t what is going on in Virginia right now .\nIf anything , the state is moving very much in the opposite direction .\nIn a prudent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the state dominated by the now out-of-power groups would be permitted to join themselves to regimes more in line with their cultures and ideological views .\nBut we do not live in a prudent and flexible political system .\nWe live in a system where the dictates of \u201c democracy \u201d are such that whichever group finds itself in the minority must submit to the elected ruling regime .\n\u201c Or else.\n\u201d No other option is permitted .\nThis is a road that often leads to violence , either by private @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the people .\nRyan McMaken ( @ ryanmcmaken ) is a senior editor at the Mises Institute .\nSend him your

It Fears You.", "content": "During the George W Bush administration it was popular in conspiracy circles to speculate that events might be orchestrated which would allow the Bush family to complete a coup against the US Constitution and hold on to power indefinitely .\nSuch paranoia and suspicion of government power in the wake of the extraordinary post-9/11 advancements in Orwellian surveillance programs and unprecedented military expansionism were perfectly understandable , but predictions that the younger Bush would not cede power at the end of his second term proved incorrect .\nIn today \u2019 s hysterical Trump-centric political environment we now see mainstream voices @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conspiratorial speculations about the current administration , and those will prove incorrect as well .\nWhat these paranoid presidential prognostications get wrong is not their extreme suspicion of government , but their assumption that America \u2019 s real power structures require a certain president to be in place in order to advance depraved totalitarian agendas .\nAs anyone paying attention knows , intense suspicion of the US government is the only sane position that anyone can possibly have ; the error is in assuming that there is no mechanism in place to ensure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one presidential administration to the next .\nIn a sense , the conspiracy theories about a Bush coup were actually correct : the Bush administration didn \u2019 t truly end .\nAll of its imperialist , power-serving agendas remained in place and were expanded under the apparent oversight of the following administration .\nThe same thing happened after the Obama administration , and the same thing\u2013whether in 2021 or 2025\u2013will happen after the Trump administration .\nThe disturbing fact of the matter is that if you ignore election dates and just look at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ government behavior over the years , you can \u2019 t really tell who is president or which political party is in power at any given point in time .\nThe mechanism which ensures the perpetuation of the same policies from administration to administration used to be referred to by analysts as the \u201c deep state \u201d , back before Trump and his supporters hijacked that term and began using it to essentially mean something like \u201c Democrats and anyone who doesn \u2019 t like Trump \u201d .\nOriginally the term deep state referred @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to some shadowy cabal of Illuminati or Satanists or reptilians , but to the simple and undeniable fact that unelected power structures exist and tend to influence America \u2019 s official elected government .\nIt wasn \u2019 t a conspiracy theory , it was a concept used in political analysis to describe how US government agencies and plutocrats form loose alliances with each other and with official Washington to influence government policy and behavior .\nIt is inevitable that such a permanent second government would exist in the current iteration of the United @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nIt \u2019 s impossible to have a globe-spanning empire of the sort America now has without long-term plans spanning years or decades for securing control of world resources , undermining rivals , securing more compliant allies , and ensuring military and economic hegemony .\nIf the US were a normal nation which simply minded its own affairs , a permanent government wouldn \u2019 t be necessary .\nBut because it isn \u2019 t , one is .\nI very seldom use the term deep state anymore , because its meaning in mainstream @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when I want to point to America \u2019 s permanent unelected power structures I usually use the word \u201c oligarchy \u201d or \u201c empire \u201d , or simply \u201c establishment \u201d .\nThis is why I haven \u2019 t been especially focused on the US presidential race , despite the Democratic primaries hitting fever pitch intensity .\nWhile I believe the race can be a useful tool for forcing establishment propagandists to expose themselves ( virulent \u201c never Trump \u201d neocon Bret Stephens just came out in support of Trump if the Democratic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pete Buttigeig , for example ) , the result of the 2020 election isn \u2019 t going to change a whole hell of a lot .\nThis might be a bit offensive to both Trump supporters and Sanders supporters , but it \u2019 s true .\nWhenever I point out that the current administration has been advancing many longstanding agendas of the CIA and neoconservative war pigs\u2013agendas like military expansionism , imprisoning Assange , regime change interventionism in Iran and Venezuela , and reigniting the Cold War\u2013his supporters always come in saying \u201c @ @ @ @ @ @ @ establishment how come the establishment is working so hard to get rid of him , huh ?\n\u201d Well , for starters , they \u2019 re not .\nNobody who can count Senate seats believes Trump will be removed from office in the current impeachment sideshow , and everyone who understood Russiagate knew it was going to dead-end at nothing .\nIf they really wanted Trump gone they wouldn \u2019 t be pussyfooting around with a bunch of kayfabe combat that they know will never hurt him .\nObviously he wasn \u2019 t @ @ @ @ @ @ @ within the establishment , but there are mechanisms in place to ensure that the empire can tick right along with a less-than-ideal president in the White House .\nThis will also hold true if Sanders miraculously makes his way through another rigged primary , and then through whatever sabotage gets thrown his way in the general election .\nSure he might be able to sign a few somewhat beneficial executive orders and we probably wouldn \u2019 t see him flirting with an Iran war , but US imperialism will march on more or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ policies would require congress to successfully implement .\nAt best he \u2019 d be a mild reformer who uses the bully pulpit to help spread awareness while being narrative managed on all sides by the billionaire media , and any changes he manages to squeak through which inconvenience the establishment at all will be reversed by a subsequent administration .\nObviously the establishment would rather have someone in the White House who doesn \u2019 t constantly put an ugly face on the empire by accidentally exposing its mechanics all the time as Trump @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have an incompetent oaf like Trump in office than someone who actively points out the evils of oligarchy and imperialism like Sanders .\nBut the establishment which runs the US-centralized empire is not afraid of Trump , and it is not afraid of Sanders .\nIt \u2019 s afraid of you .\nThe unelected power establishment has ways of ensuring its dominance amid the comings and goings of America \u2019 s official elected government ; they are perfectly capable of dealing with one man being a less than ideal steward of the empire @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with , at all , is the prospect of ordinary people finally rising up and using the power of their numbers to force real change .\nThat is what they are really fighting against when they try to sabotage populist candidates : not the candidates themselves , but populism itself .\nYou wouldn \u2019 t know it from reading the billionaire media , but the Yellow Vests protests in France are still going on and have remained widespread for more than a year now .\nThis lack of coverage is partially due to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ responsible for conveying the idea that the only governments whose citizens dislike them are those which haven \u2019 t been absorbed into the imperial blob like China and Iran .\nBut it \u2019 s also because the propagandists don \u2019 t want us getting any ideas .\nThe reason the propagandists work so hard to manufacture the consent of the governed is because they absolutely do require that consent .\nIf enough people decide that the status quo isn \u2019 t working for them and begin rising up to force it to change @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the establishment can do to stop them .\nRight now the only thing keeping people from rising up in this way is the fact that they \u2019 ve been successfully propagandized not to , and the propagandists intend to keep it that way .\nBut eyes are beginning to open .\nIf real change is coming , it will come from there .\nNot from electing anyone president , but from a large-scale awakening to the reality of our situation .\nThe only thing standing in the way is a thin layer of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The best way to get around the internet censors and make sure you see the stuff I

January 20th , the Virginia State Congress remained totally unfazed by what the people wanted and proceeded to advance numerous unconstitutional gun laws over the following week .\nWhile everyone has been focused on the Wuhan coronavirus , state lawmakers have been quietly eroding gun rights .\nProving they don \u2019 t care at all about the opinions of the people of Virginia , the state \u2019 s Senate passed a \u201c red flag \u201d gun law only two days later .\nHere \u2019 s the summary of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any attorney for the Commonwealth or any law-enforcement officer may apply to a general district court , circuit court , or juvenile and domestic relations district court judge or magistrate for an emergency substantial risk order to prohibit a person who poses a substantial risk of injury to himself or others from purchasing , possessing , or transporting a firearm .\nIf an emergency substantial risk order is issued , a judge or magistrate may issue a search warrant to remove firearms from such person .\nAn emergency substantial risk order shall expire @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the order .\nThe bill requires a court hearing in the circuit court for the jurisdiction where the order was issued within 14 days from issuance of an emergency substantial risk order to determine whether a substantial risk order should be issued .\nSeized firearms shall be retained by a law-enforcement agency for the duration of an emergency substantial risk order or a substantial risk order or , for a substantial risk order and with court approval , may be transferred to a third party 21 years of age or older chosen by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nThe bill allows the complainant of the original warrant to file a motion for a hearing to extend the substantial risk order prior to its expiration .\nThe court may extend the substantial risk order for a period not longer than 180 days .\nThe bill provides that persons who are subject to a substantial risk order , until such order has been dissolved by a court , are guilty of a Class 1 misdemeanor for purchasing , possessing , or transporting a firearm ; are disqualified from having a concealed handgun @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by a licensed firearms dealer .\nThe bill also provides that a person who transfers a firearm to a person he knows has been served with a warrant or who is the subject of a substantial risk order is guilty of a Class 4 felony .\nThe bill creates a computerized substantial risk order registry for the entry of orders issued pursuant to provisions in the bill .\n( source ) Of course , we all know the dangers of red flag gun laws .\nAnyone can swear out a complaint against a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doesn \u2019 t want his victim to be able to protect herself or himself .\nAdd to that , numerous law-abiding citizens have been killed when police burst in to serve the warrant and seize the gun owner \u2019 s firearms .\nBut that \u2019 s not all that Virginia has in store for gun owners .\nAlso two days after the rally of gun owners , the Senate Judiciary Committee advanced a proposed new law that would make it more difficult for Virginians to get a concealed carry permit in the form @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it more difficult for rural residents to take the required training and it makes it more expensive for poverty-stricken gun owners .\nOn Friday the House advanced the following bills to the Senate for further approval .\nHB2 would criminalize the private transfer of firearms in the Commonwealth .\nUnlike SB70 , which was passed by the Senate , HB2 would criminalize almost all firearm transfers \u2013 not just sales .\nUnder this extreme legislation , even lending a brother your rifle for a deer hunt or letting your daughter borrow a handgun @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a felony conviction and up to 5 years in jail .\nAdditionally , the recipient could face up to a full year of incarceration .\nHB674 would create a \u201c red flag \u201d gun confiscation procedure that is similar to that created by SB240 .\nJust like the senate bill , HB674 would empower the government to strip an individual \u2019 s constitutional right to keep and bear arms and seize their firearms pursuant to an ex parte order .\nHowever , whereas SB240 would require a commonwealth \u2019 s attorney or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ court , HB674 provides even less safeguards \u2013 allowing a single law enforcement officer to petition for a confiscation order .\nHB812 would ration the right to keep and bear arms by limiting Virginians to one handgun purchase per 30-day period .\nUnlike SB35 , which has passed the full Senate , HB812 does not provide an exemption to this restriction for CHP holders .\nFrom 1993 to 2012 , Virginia had a \u201c one-handgun-a-month \u201d law that rationed the number of handguns law-abiding gun owners could purchase to one a month .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ Wilder and other gun control advocates sold the handgun rationing measure as a way to curb gun trafficking from Virginia to more restrictive Northeast states , particularly New York .\nHB812 comes along after New York City billionaire and gun control financier Michael Bloomberg spent an exorbitant sum in the 2019 election cycle .\nAccording to ATF Trace data , there were fewer firearms traced to Virginia in the three years after the law was repealed than in the three years prior to repeal .\nHB9 would re-victimize burglary and robbery victims by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ report the theft of a firearm to law enforcement within 24 hours of discovering the theft .\nThese victims would be fined up to $ 250 .\nIn the aftermath of a burglary , victims are occupied with a host of concerns .\nThe first and foremost concern is the physical safety and well-being of themselves and their loved ones .\nTo place an additional burden on crime victims in their moment of despair is the ruthless act of a callous state that exhibits no regard for the hardship victims face as they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would eliminate Virginia \u2019 s state firearms preemption law .\nCurrent law ensures that those living and traveling throughout Virginia are subject to the same predictable state statutes wherever they are in the Commonwealth .\nWith this regimen , law-abiding gun owners can move about the state without fear of being ensnared by a confusing patchwork of disparate local ordinances .\nUnable to predict or comprehend the contours of the various ordinances in Virginia \u2019 s 95 counties and 38 independent cities , CHP holders would be forced to forego their Right-to-Carry for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or complicated local law .\nHB1004 would prohibit those subject to a \u00a719.2-152.10 protective order from possessing firearms .\nThose subject to a \u00a719.2-152.10 protective order are already prohibited from purchasing or transporting firearms while the order is in effect .\nUnlike other protective orders that trigger a firearm possession prohibition , a petitioner for a \u00a719.2-152.10 protective order does not need to bear any relation to the respondent .\nThe absence of a relationship requirement opens the \u00a719.2-152.10 protective order procedure up to abuse .\nVerbal altercations between co-workers , neighbors , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ perceived , or claimed to perceive , the other as making a \u201c threat \u201d could result in the extinguishment of a person \u2019 s Second Amendment rights and the forfeiture of their firearms .\nHB1083 severely restricts parental decisions about firearms in the home by making it a Class 6 felony to leave an unlocked and loaded gun in the home with a child or teenager under the age of 18 .\nCurrent law only applies this restriction to children under the age of 14 and provides that the punishment for such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This law is unnecessary as Virginia already has a child abuse and neglect statute that provides felony penalties for parents who engage in dangerous conduct .\n( source ) Is it any wonder that parts of Virginia are considering secession from the state ?\nThe protest meant nothing in the eyes of Virginia lawmakers .\nThe advancement of these gun laws is a slap in the face to every gun owner who has protested in person , written or emailed his or her members of Congress , and attended local meetings .\nIt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ don \u2019 t care what Virginians have to say about the laws they pass .\nIt underlines their blithe dismissal of the Sanctuary municipalities and of the massive peaceful protest that even saw protesters cleaning up the area before they left .\nThe protest may have meant nothing to lawmakers , but to gun owners , it meant everything .\nIt means that people in Virginia will stand up for their rights .\nIt means they will not back down .\nIt means they \u2019 re willing to put themselves on the line @ @ @ @ @ @ @ state that still has a flag that says \u201c Sic Semper Tyrannis.\n\u201d But as for the state government ?\nYou know , the one purchased by presidential candidate Michael Bloomberg ?\nThis is not a

.\nIf the killer virus comes here and spreads , we may to have to follow suit.\n\u201d CHINA IS THE PSYCHOLOGICAL ICE-BREAKER FOR THE REST OF THE PLANET .\n\u201c Well , they did it there , so it can be done\u2026 \u201d \u201c Thank you , China .\nYou \u2019 ve showed us what efficiency and necessity look like.\n\u201d The biggest potential contagion here has nothing to do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do with other countries deciding to follow China \u2019 s example .\nAnd now we come to THE VACCINE against the virus .\nThis is where some very bad rubber meets a very bad road .\nSeveral of the novel vaccines being rushed toward approval and production are completely experimental .\nThey have never been openly used on the public .\nSo the stage is set for a grand planet-wide guinea-pig test .\nIn a recent piece , I explained the admitted danger of one of these vaccine varieties\u2014RNA vaccines .\nThey can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to war against itself .\nWhat are the chances that one of these new

, unconstitutional laws .\nThat \u2019 s because they seem to be modeling themselves after one of those countries where the government can not be publicly criticized without great risk to the critic .\nYet another new bill is on the table and this one criminalizes criticism of certain government officials .\nThe summary of HB1627 , proposed by Delegate Jeffrey M. Bourne , reads : Threats and harassment of certain officials and property ; venue .\nProvides that certain crimes relating @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the City of Richmond if the victim is the Governor , Governor-elect , Lieutenant Governor , Lieutenant Governor-elect , Attorney General , or Attorney General-elect , a member or employee of the General Assembly , a justice of the Supreme Court of Virginia , or a judge of the Court of Appeals of Virginia .\nIn addition , threats to damage property may be prosecuted in the City of Richmond if the property is owned by the Commonwealth and located in the Capitol District .\n( source ) Oh , muffin .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ been hurting your feelings ?\nThen , by all means , while you \u2019 re actively trying to dismantle the Second Amendment , you should pass another unconstitutional law to attack the First Amendment .\nIt \u2019 s sort of like declaring a State of Emergency and calling gun owners white supremacists because you know you pushed them too hard and now you \u2019 re scared .\nBut longer-lasting .\nIt \u2019 s also like communist China where critics can end up vanishing into a labor camp or watch their entire family be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mean that a critic can be imprisoned for 3-15 years per count for any hurtful words about the king .\nWhat exactly do the words \u201c threats \u201d and \u201c harassment \u201d mean in the terms of HB1627 ?\nI \u2019 m glad you asked .\nIf you take a look at some other codes that have been previously passed in Virginiastan , you \u2019 ll see that it can be something as simple as foul language .\nThe bar for harassment is already as low as \u201c vulgar language \u201d in Virginia @ @ @ @ @ @ @ person , with the intent to coerce , intimidate , or harass any person , shall use a computer or computer network to communicate obscene , vulgar , profane , lewd , lascivious , or indecent language , or make any suggestion or proposal of an obscene nature , or threaten any illegal or

Attorney General-elect , a member or employee of the General Assembly , a justice of the Supreme Court of Virginia , or a judge of the Court of Appeals of Virginia .\nBourne \u2019 s Bill also changes the language of \u201c he shall be guilty \u201d to \u201c he is guilty \u201d of a Class 1 misdemeanor .\nIt \u2019 s insane that a bill defining @ @ @ @ @ @ @ books in Virginia \u2013 and it \u2019 s even more insane that someone is proposing expanding it so that politicians can legally intimidate their detractors with ease .\n( source ) Can you imagine the way this bill could be used to silence dissent ?\nIt \u2019 s so vague that it could be enforced completely arbitrarily .\nIf you say mean things on the internet , if you use swear words when talking about our elected officials , or if you happen to suggest some solutions like\u2026 I don \u2019 t know\u2026 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ immoral ?\n\u2026then you could be guilty under this proposed law .\nMy comments section alone would fill an entire prison cellblock , not to mention the comments sections of other websites .\nWhen a government plays stupid games like trying to disarm a bunch of gun-loving , rural-dwelling Virginians , that government is bound to get stupid prizes like those same Virginians marching on the capital and criticizing them on the internet .\nPeople in public office open themselves up to criticism .\nThis is why we have a First Amendment .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ allowed to be criticized , it \u2019 s the Governor , Governor-elect , Lieutenant Governor , Lieutenant Governor-elect , Attorney General , or Attorney General-elect , a member or employee of the General Assembly , a justice of the Supreme Court of Virginia , or a judge of the Court of Appeals of Virginia .\nBy the very nature of running for public office , one should expect to be the target of some verbal harassment .\nPeople who are so thin-skinned as to make a law about why nobody should be able @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them have no business whatsoever in government .\nI wonder if this petition to recall Governor Northam counts as being abusive toward him ?\n( Please take a moment to go sign it . )\nThe bad news is , the Virginia state congress has been working on another bill meant to keep them in power by changing the rules for a recall .\nRemoval of public officers ; petition requirements ; signature requirements .\nClarifies that the requirement that a petition for the removal of a public officer be signed under penalty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or persons filing such petition with the circuit court .\nRegistered voters signing the petition for purposes of reaching the required number of signatures shall not be required to sign under penalty of perjury .\nThe bill also increases the required number of signatures to a number of registered voters in the locality equal to 25 percent , up from 10 percent , of the total number of votes cast at the last election for the office , and requires the signatures to be collected within a 60-day period .\n( source ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Virginia .\nRedistricting and a crapton of money from Michael Bloomberg during the election served to turn this state \u2019 s congress upside down .\nA legitimate protest has been meaningless to the government of Virginia .\nThe members of the legislature don \u2019 t care what Virginians think and they \u2019 re arrogant enough to pass vaguely worded laws to

"2020-02-06", "source": "activistpost", "title": "Washington State Committee Passes Three Year Ban on Facial Recognition", "content": "On Tuesday , a House committee approved a bill to put a three-year ban , or moratorium , on the use of facial recognition for surveillance or any other purposes by the state and its political subdivisions .\nPassage into law would represent an important first step towards protecting privacy and rejecting the national surveillance state .\nA coalition of three Democrats introduced House Bill 2856 ( HB2856 ) on Jan. 27 .\nThe legislation would put a three-year ban on the use of facial recognition by government in Washington State .\nIf passed into law , state and local @ @ @ @ @ @ @ obtaining , retaining , requesting , accessing , or using any facial recognition technology or any information obtained from or by use of facial recognition technology.\n\u201d Additionally , any information obtained from or by the use of facial recognition would be barred from being used as evidence in any trial or other proceeding before a court or other authority subject to the jurisdiction of Washington .\nThis legislation is part of a broader nationwide movement to limit this invasive surveillance technology at the local and state level .\nSan Francisco , Oakland @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prohibited government use of facial recognition technology , along with Somerville , Northhampton , Cambridge and Brookline , Massachusetts .\nPortland , Oregon is considering a similar ban .\nThe California governor recently signed a bill that imposes a 3-year ban on the use of the tech in conjunction with police body-worn cameras , leading to the shutdown of one of the biggest facial recognition programs in the country .\nA recent report revealed that the federal government has turned state drivers \u2019 license photos into a giant facial recognition database , putting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ perpetual electronic police lineup .\nThe revelations generated widespread outrage , but this story isn \u2019 t new .\nThe federal government has been developing a massive , nationwide facial recognition system for years .\nThe FBI rolled out a nationwide facial-recognition program in the fall of 2014 , with the goal of building a giant biometric database with pictures provided by the states and corporate friends .\nIn 2016 , the Center on Privacy and Technology at Georgetown Law released \u201c The Perpetual Lineup , \u201d a massive report on law enforcement @ @ @ @ @ @ @ U.S. You can read the complete report at perpetuallineup.org .\nThe organization conducted a year-long investigation and collected more than 15,000 pages of documents through more than 100 public records requests .\nThe report paints a disturbing picture of intense cooperation between the federal government , and state and local law enforcement to develop a massive facial recognition database .\nThere are many technical and legal problems with facial recognition , including significant concerns about the accuracy of the technology , particularly when reading the facial features of minority populations .\nDuring a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ California , facial recognition misidentified 26 members of the California legislature as people in a database of arrest photos .\nWith facial recognition technology , police and other government officials have the capability to track individuals in real-time .\nThese systems allow law enforcement agents to use video cameras and continually scan everybody who walks by .\nAccording to the report , several major police departments have expressed an interest in this type of real-time tracking .\nDocuments revealed agencies in at least five major cities , including Los Angeles , either claimed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ street cameras , bought technology with the capability , or expressed written interest in buying it .\nIn all likelihood , the federal government heavily involves itself in helping state and local agencies obtain this technology .\nThe feds provide grant money to local law enforcement agencies for a vast array of surveillance gear , including ALPRs , stingray devices and drones .\nThe federal government essentially encourages and funds a giant nationwide surveillance net and then taps into the information via fusion centers and the Information Sharing Environment ( ISE ) .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ to combat terrorism , but that is not how they are being used .\nThe ACLU pointed to a bipartisan congressional report to demonstrate the true nature of government fusion centers : \u201c They haven \u2019 t contributed anything meaningful to counterterrorism efforts .\nInstead , they have largely served as police surveillance and information sharing nodes for law enforcement efforts targeting the frequent subjects of police attention : Black and brown people , immigrants , dissidents , and the poor.\n\u201d Fusion centers operate within the broader ISE .\nAccording to its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , operators , and investigators with information needed to enhance national security .\nThese analysts , operators , and investigators\u2026have mission needs to collaborate and share information with each other and with private sector partners and our foreign allies.\n\u201d In other words , ISE serves as a conduit for the sharing of information gathered without a warrant .\nKnown ISE partners include the Office of Director of National Intelligence which oversees 17 federal agencies and organizations , including the NSA .\nISE utilizes these partnerships to collect and share data on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Reports that the Berkeley Police Department in cooperation with a federal fusion center deployed cameras equipped to surveil a \u201c free speech \u201d rally and Antifa counterprotests provided the first solid link between the federal government and local authorities in facial recognition surveillance .\nIn a nutshell , without state and local cooperation , the feds have a much more difficult time gathering information .\nPassage of state laws and local ordinances banning facial recognition eliminates one avenue for gathering facial recognition data .\nSimply put , data that doesn \u2019 t exist @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nHB2856 will now go to the House Rules Committee , where it will need to pass by a majority vote before the full House can consider it .\nMichael Boldin [ send him

Filburn: The Supreme Court Case That Gave the Federal Government Nearly Unlimited Power", "content": "Every presidential election in the United States follows a clear formula .\nFirst , many people with absolutely no chance of winning the presidency declare their candidacies .\nThose who get washed out of the race late in the game see their fortunes rise , which was their goal from the first .\nSecond , candidates with even a chance at winning their party \u2019 s nomination drift to the outer fringe of their party \u2019 s ideology .\nFor Democrats this year , that means appealing to the most progressive of the progressive wing of their party .\nFinally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two candidates , each of them will converge in the middle , eschewing the ideological members of their own parties .\nThis is so common that every politically observant American is fully aware of what is happening .\nBut this dyed-in-the-wool process obscures the most pernicious element of every presidential campaign , which sees both the candidates and the voters they hope to attract ignoring the Constitution at every turn .\nTo the shame of both groups , they don \u2019 t even seem to realize what they \u2019 re doing .\nPresidential @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from Bernie Sanders \u2019 s plan to move to single-payer health care to Donald Trump \u2019 s plan for a wall on our southern border to Elizabeth Warren \u2019 s plans for just about everything else .\nBut nearly all of these plans are unconstitutional twice over : not only are presidents not given the authority to do these things , but the federal government itself is also not empowered to do these things .\nThe Constitution creates a government of enumerated powers , which means the federal government is only authorized to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Constitution .\nAnd that list is relatively short .\nThe list appears in Article One , Section Eight and enumerates the proper objects of congressional legislation .\nCongress can : \u2022 borrow money , coin money , regulate its value , and punish counterfeiters \u2022 regulate commerce with foreign nations , among the states , and with Indian tribes \u2022 suppress insurrections , repel invasions , declare war , raise an army , maintain a navy , and make rules for the army and navy \u2022 organize the Militia ( leaving to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the authority of training the Militias ) That \u2019 s it .\nThis is all the Constitution permits the federal government to do .\nConsider the United States \u2019 ill-advised flirtation with Prohibition\u2014which was enacted almost exactly 100 years ago .\nNowhere in the Article One , Section Eight powers does one see the authority to \u201c ban the manufacture , transport , or sales of alcohol within the United States.\n\u201d When Americans decided that they wanted a coast-to-coast ban on alcohol , they amended the Constitution to give the federal government @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Americans came to their senses and revoked this authority by amending the Constitution again .\nThe 21st Amendment was the only amendment ever ratified for the purpose of undoing a previous amendment .\nBut notice the difficulties that honest people faced when trying to accomplish a pervasive political goal .\nAs of 1933 , when the 21st Amendment was ratified , Americans still had a constitutionally limited federal government and what Justice Louis Brandeis famously called \u201c laboratories of democracy \u201d in the states .\nThe purpose of limiting the federal government @ @ @ @ @ @ @ put the lion \u2019 s share of governance in state hands .\nEach state would govern somewhat differently and , in so doing , the nation would be a huge experiment in democracy .\nStates that governed well would gain businesses and population .\nStates that governed poorly would lose .\nBy observing what other states did well , each state could learn how to govern better .\nBy losing businesses and population , each state would have an incentive to act on what it learned .\nThe \u201c laboratories of democracy \u201d @ @ @ @ @ @ @ market competition brought to their economic lives .\nBut who ended up being tasked with deciding what Article One , Section Eight actually meant ?\nHerein lies the wrinkle that enables all manner of constitutional mischief in the United States .\nThe institution that ended up deciding what the federal government is empowered to do is itself a branch of the federal government .\nAnd it should come as no surprise that when push comes to shove , the Supreme Court routinely finds in favor of empowering the federal government .\nThis sort @ @ @ @ @ @ @ following ratification of the 21st Amendment .\nIn 1942 , the Supreme Court decided a case , Wickard v. Filburn , in which farmer Roscoe Filburn ran afoul of a federal law that limited how much wheat he was allowed to grow .\nA careful reader might , and should , ask where the federal government \u2019 s right to legislate the wheat market is to be found\u2014because the word \u201c wheat \u201d is nowhere to be found in the Constitution .\nBe that as it may , the federal government \u2019 s @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to keep the price of wheat high enough for farmers to remain profitable .\nThe Agricultural Adjustment Act of 1938 put an upper limit on how much wheat farmers were allowed to grow , which would serve to keep prices high by limiting supply .\nRoscoe Filburn had grown 12 more acres of wheat than the law allowed .\nBut not only did he not sell the excess wheat outside of his home state , but he also didn \u2019 t sell it at all .\nHe used the wheat from those 12 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was very clearly not engaging in commerce , let alone interstate commerce , yet the Supreme Court found ( unanimously ) that because Congress had the authority to regulate interstate commerce , Congress also had the authority to prohibit Filburn from growing those 12 acres of wheat for his own use .\nThe Supreme Court \u2019 s \u201c reasoning \u201d ?\nHad Filburn not fed his cattle that excess wheat , he would have been forced to purchase wheat on the open market .\nAnd even if he purchased wheat that was grown @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would have made less wheat available within his home state for other wheat buyers .\nConsequently , some wheat buyers within his home state would then have had to buy wheat from outside the state .\nTherefore , Filburn \u2019 s non-commercial activity was , according to the Supreme Court , interstate commerce .\nThe mental gymnastics that went into this ruling made just about any activity interstate commerce by definition .\nSince Wickard , any time Congress has wanted to exercise power not authorized by the Constitution , lawmakers have simply had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they want to accomplish to interstate commerce .\nWhy ?\nBecause they know they can get away with it .\nSo today we have NASA , the FDA , the USDA , the EPA , federally subsidized student loans , Medicare , Medicaid , a federal minimum wage , and hundreds of other federal agencies , programs , and initiatives .\nSome of these do , indeed , involve interstate commerce .\nMany do not .\nA century ago , we amended the Constitution when we wanted the federal government to exercise a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , we allow Congress to exercise almost any authority it likes .\nFurther , we allow Congress to hand its authority over to unelected bureaucrats .\nSo , whereas regulating alcohol required amending the Constitution , regulating marijuana requires only legislation .\nRegulating prescription medicines requires only bureaucratic action .\nWe have progressed so far down the path of reinterpreting the Constitution as a document that empowers government , rather than one that limits it , that unelected bureaucrats today exercise power that the Constitution even withholds from Congress .\nThis is troubling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ altruistic , informed , and intelligent .\nBut when they aren \u2019 t , it is extremely dangerous .\nAnd as if all that weren \u2019 t bad enough , we now have presidential candidates detailing their agendas to the voting public .\nIf Congress , enabled by the Supreme Court , has overstepped its constitutional bounds , the presidency has eclipsed the very definition of the office .\nThe president heads the executive branch of government .\nIts role , by definition , is to execute the laws that Congress passes .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ terms .\nThey do this almost every time they offer a \u201c plan \u201d for anything .\nCongress is charged with the legislative function , and this they are intended to exercise within a constitutional framework deliberately designed to make that job exceedingly difficult .\nWhy were things designed this way ?\nTo limit the ability of the federal government to do much of anything without extremely broad support .\nThis is what safeguards the rights of the individual .\nWhen Roscoe Filburn \u2019 s right to grow wheat on his own land @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the rest of this was largely a foregone conclusion .\nThe sad result has been a government nearly limitless in its power .\nSadder still is what this has done to our elections : Every four years , the American people ask candidates for more things neither the president nor Congress is constitutionally authorized to deliver .\nAnd this encourages a brand of candidate to run for office who is willing to ignore the Constitution in exchange for winning elections .\nThe first step to stopping this process lies in reading , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the United States .\nThis means , first and foremost , placing the legislative function in the hands of Congress alone and taking seriously Article One , Section Eight .\nIt means , in short , limiting government again .", "author":

the late 1960s through the early 1980s , Italy was a hotbed of assassination , shoot-outs and bombings between various factions of the far-left , the far-right and the Italian government \u2013 with American , British and Soviet intelligence agencies often pulling the strings .\nWhile the death toll was a lot lower than it could have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and oft-overlooked area of history .\nWhen all was said and done , the Italian political landscape had been radically changed .\nThousands of leftists were forced to flee the nation , but ultimately , shocked by the violence , Italian politics moderated .\nDid we mention that a Masonic Lodge came very close to overthrowing the government ?\nStrap yourself in .\nYou \u2019 re about to take a bumpy ride down an obscure historic lane , where \u201c truth being stranger than fiction \u201d is most certainly true ( and well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Years of Lead Before diving into the Italian Years of Lead , it \u2019 s important to understand the political climate of Italy after the Second World War .\nThe Communist Party was always a strong force in post-war Italian politics .\nIn the first election after the war \u2019 s end , in 1946 , the Communist Party received 18.9 percent of the vote .\nGoing into the second election at the end of the war , the Communist Party was poised for even greater success , buoyed by their alliance with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ replay of what happened in Czechoslovakia .\nIn both cases , the Communist Party had entered into an alliance with naive Socialists , whom they quickly outfoxed , dominating the electoral combination of nominal equals .\nMeanwhile , in Czechoslovakia , a Communist coup d \u2019 etat was engineered by a section of the government dominated by Communist elected officials .\nThe CIA stepped in , putting their thumb on the scale in an attempt to prevent the Communists from succeeding in Italy as well .\nThis was one of the first battles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ told , the CIA funneled somewhere between $ 10 and $ 20 million to defeat the Communists ( between $ 106 and $ 212 million in 2019 dollars ) .\nIn contrast , the Soviets spent between $ 8 and $ 10 million every month to ensure a Communist victory in the elections .\nIn an incredibly tense and vitriolic campaign , the Christian Democrats eventually bested the Communists , getting 48 percent of the vote to the Communist Party \u2019 s 31 .\nThe anti-Communist Socialist grouping netted the balance of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the rest , as is common in Italy .\nThe Christian Democrats formed a broad tent coalition , despite having an electoral mandate that did not require it , bringing in Liberals , Republicans and Social Democrats .\nHowever , this did not end the involvement of the CIA in Italy , nor the strength of the Communist Party .\nThe CIA spent an average of $ 5 million annually in Italy , both to prop up center-right governments and to weaken the influence of the trade unions , who traditionally supported the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first Italian election after the fall of Communism in 1992 , the Communist Party polled between 22 and 33 percent in Italian elections , a fact that always filled the CIA with dread .\nIt is worth briefly mentioning that the successor to the National / Republican Fascist Party , the Italian Social Movement , never polled higher than 9 percent .\nThe CIA was also a key player in Italy through Gladio , the stay-behind organization it backed in Italy to fight a guerilla insurgency against a potential Communist takeover of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ s direct involvement in the Years of Lead is a hotly debated topic among historians .\nThe Hot Autumn of 1969 and 1970 Throughout the 1960s , Italy became increasingly industrialized and modernized , which led to discontent among both the left and the right .\nThese forces were very briefly united in a series of protests in Italy in 1968 .\nHowever , the similarities between the far-left and far-right were too tenuous , and the establishment parties were largely skeptical of the counter-cultural orientation of the young radicals .\nThese protests @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Italy as the \u201c Hot Autumn.\n\u201d This was a series of wildcat strikes throughout Italy in its industrial sectors , largely in response to layoffs due to increased efficiencies in industrial production .\nIt was the basis of a growing Communist Party , and one that was shifting even further to the left in response to networks of activists known as \u201c autonomists.\n\u201d The Italian Years of Lead were in some part a reaction of the far-right to this ascendant Communist movement .\nHowever , as stated above , international @ @ @ @ @ @ @ truth of how the whole thing started moving is incredibly complex .\nThe Years of Lead Claim Their First Victim : The Death of Antonio Annarumma The initial movement in the Years of Lead was simply a continuation of the Hot Autumn .\nA group of autonomist students and workers occupied a FIAT factory in Milan .\nDuring a related protest in November 1969 , Milan police officer Antonio Annarumma was killed by an iron tube .\nThe leftists protesters claimed that this was an accident , however , the courts found differently @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but certainly not the last , bombing in the Italian Years of Lead .\nOn December 12 , 1969 , a bomb went off in the National Agrarian Bank \u2019 s headquarters in Piazza Fontana , some 200 meters from the Duomo .\nThe bomb claimed the lives of 17 people , with another 88 wounded .\nAt first , the press and the police blamed the attack on anarchists .\nPolice arrested prominent anarchist Giuseppe Pinelli , who died under suspicious circumstances when he fell from the fourth-story window of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ three police in charge were later investigated , but cleared of any wrongdoing .\nPolice commissioner Luigi Calabresi was later assassinated by autonomist paramilitary group Lotta Continua as revenge for the death of Pinelli .\nAnother anarchist , Pietro Valpreda , was arrested and held without charge for three years after a cab driver identified him as his \u201c suspicious passenger.\n\u201d He was later exonerated .\nApproximately three years after the bombing , the police finally switched their focus from investigating anarchist operatives to looking into the far-right , neo-fascist grouping Ordine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ March 3 , 1972 , Italian police arrested Franco Freda , Giovanni Ventura and Ordine Nuovo founder Pino Rauti , who consistently described himself as a non-fascist and a leftist throughout his lengthy political career on the far-right in Italy .\nThe first two were eventually convicted for two separate bombings in 1987 , and sentenced to 16 years .\nThe Masonic P2 Lodge \u2013 which we will go into in greater detail later \u2013 played a key role in running interference for the accused through their member General Gianandelio Maletti , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Italian state security services .\nCuriously , the initial reaction of the police was not far off from what Ordine Nuovo had intended .\nThe bombings were meant not just to create a sense of overall terror , but to implicate the Communist movement in Italy .\nThe Left Strikes Back : The Formation of the Red Brigades In reaction to Ordine Nuovo and inspired by Latin American guerilla movements , as well as similar movements on the continent , the Brigate Rosse was formed in 1970 .\nAs was the case @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Germany at the time , they saw the post-war government as a mere continuation of the previous fascist regime , now backed by NATO .\nThey grew out of a series of strikes against the Sit-Siemens corporation .\nThe bulk of their initial leadership were young and had been expelled from the Italian Communist Party \u2019 s youth movement for their extremism .\nTheir first action was a simple one : They set ablaze the car of Sit-Siemens corporate leader , Giuseppe Leoni .\nNo one was hurt .\nThe Red Brigades and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ actions throughout the Italian Years of Lead , and will pop up a number of times throughout this article .\nA failed fascist coup would soon increase the tensions in Italy .\nThe failed fascist coup of 1970 probably had very little chance of success .\nStill , it became a watchword on the Italian left .\nHundreds of members of Neo-Nazi group National Vanguard plotted to overthrow the government with 187 allies from the Italian Forestry Service , of all places .\nThe plan was to seize the offices of RAI , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what the Forestry Service members were in charge of .\nVanguard militants planned to assassinate the President of Italy , Giuseppe Saragat , as well as Italian police chief Angelo Vicari , while seizing the Quirinale , the Ministry of the Interior and the Ministry of Defense .\nThe Vanguard would then have a large cache of weapons at the ready .\nHigh-ranking military officials including Air Force General Giuseppe Casero were involved , as was the Sicilian mafia .\nThe plotters believed they would be supported by NATO forces in the Mediterrenean @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was marginal within the CIA and other intelligence services , which saw the status quo as the best policy in the region .\nA couple of people entered the Ministry of the Interior , but the coup otherwise went nowhere , as it was called off at the last minute .\nAll 46 plotters were eventually acquitted , because the coup was such a massive failure .\nThe Years of Lead Ramp Up : After the Coup While the coup was somewhat comical in its ineffectiveness , it was like throwing gas on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nArmored car driver Alessandro Floris was assassinated by the October 22 Group .\nThe arrest of his assassin , Mario Rossi , led to the dismantling of the group by Italian police , who quickly stumbled onto the cache of weapons and propaganda the group was hoarding .\nThis group was considered a precursor of the Red Brigades who , in April 1974 , kidnapped a judge in an attempt to free October 22 Group prisoners .\nPolice officer Luigi Calabresi was the next victim , assassinated on May 17 , 1972 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then shifted their focus to neofascist militants .\nThree members of Lotta Continua were eventually convicted 16 years after his death .\nNext was the May 31 , 1972 bombing in Peteano , which claimed the lives of three carabinieri .\nThis was initially blamed on Lotta Continua as well , however , it was later found out to be the work of neofascist terrorist Vincenzo Vinciguerra .\nMuch like the earlier neofascist bombing , this was a false flag , with the intention of making the Italian state act in a more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ services helped Vinciguerra escape Italy to the safe harbor of Francisco Franco \u2019 s Spain .\nFurther investigation found that Nuovo Ordo had worked closely with the Italian state security services to help execute the bombing .\nOn April 16 , 1973 , two members of Potere Operaio attacked the house of Italian Social Movement member Mario Mattei with a flammable device .\nHe escaped unscathed , while his two sons , aged 8 and 22 , burned to death .\nTheir charred bodies were found embracing one another after the fire was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Italian Social Movement , a small , but mainstream party in Italy , played no part in the Italian Years of Lead , whose right-wing actors were cut from a far more radical bent than the Social Movement \u2019 s parliamentarians .\nOne month later , the police headquarters in Milan was bombed by anarchist Gianfranco Bertoli .\nThe attack killed four and wounded 75 .\nIn May of 1974 , the Piazza della Loggia in Brescia was bombed by Ordine Nuovo .\nEight people died and 102 were injured .\nOne @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Italian Social Movement were murdered in Padua , murder initially ascribed ( like the burning of Mario Mattei \u2019 s home ) to infighting within the Italian right .\nThe Red Brigades later claimed the murders \u2013 their first .\nPreviously , the organization had only participated in bank robberies , kidnappings and bombings .\nA second fascist coup was planned for July 1974 , but never executed .\nOn August 4 , 1974 , Nuovo Ordine bombed the Italicus Express train , killing 12 and injuring 48 .\nWhile Nuovo Ordine claimed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to justice .\nFor those having trouble keeping track , the right-wing terrorist groups mostly bombed things in an attempt to get the government to crack down , while the left-wing terrorist groups specialized in kidnappings and targeted assassinations .\nSome Red Brigade leaders were arrested in 1974 , but the organization continued \u2013 as did the violence .\nIndeed , the violence began to be somewhat accepted as part of life in Italy at the time .\nThe far-left sympathizers generally claimed that the violence attributed to the far-left was in fact @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the far-right .\nThe murders , bombings and kidnappings are too numerous to go into detail starting around 1975 .\nThis was the year that left-wing groups killed MSI militant Mikis Mantakas during a riot and MSI militant Sergio Ramelli was beaten to death by members of Avanguardia Operaia ( a successor group to Lotta Continua ) with wrenches .\nLeft-wing student activist Alberto Brasili was stabbed to death by neo-fascists and carabinieri Giovanni D \u2019 Alfonso was murdered by the Red Brigades .\nThings only intensified in 1976 .\nLeft-wing group Prima @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Neo-fascist Pierluigi Concutelli assassinated Judge Vittorio Occorsio .\nIn 1976 , there were several more murders , almost all of them perpetrated by left-wing terrorist groups , including the murder of Carlo Casalegno , deputy director of liberal newspaper La Stampa .\nIn 1978 , there were no fewer than 12 murders by left-wing groups , most of them by the Red Brigades , including a security chief for FIAT motors , three police officers , three judges , a university professor , and a notary .\nThings had reached a fever pitch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ return to a peaceful normal .\nItaly finally turned a corner when the Red Brigades went a step too far : They kidnapped Italian former Prime Minister Aldo Moro , who at the time was the president of the mainstream center-right party in Italy , the Christian Democrats .\nThe former Prime Minister \u2019 s car was ambushed by members of the Red Brigades on March 16 , 1978 .\nThe assailants fired 91 shots at his five bodyguards , all of whom were killed in the attack .\nPrima Linea militant Mario @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he knew that everything was going to change \u2013 the Red Brigades had finally bitten off more than they could chew .\nThe actual motive of the attack is not entirely clear , but it was probably to disrupt negotiations between Christian Democracy and the Communist Party of Italy .\nThe latter was finally being brought into government , albeit in indirect roles , for the first time since the end of the Second World War .\nMoro wrote 86 letters during the 55 days he was held in captivity , including to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but also to his family .\nSome were sent and delivered , others were discovered later .\nConclusive evidence demonstrates that Moro was not tortured .\nHe was , however , put on a \u201c trial \u201d by a \u201c people \u2019 s court \u201d of Red Brigades , with predictable results .\nThe Red Brigades wanted to trade him for terrorists imprisoned , and eventually requested only one .\nMoro \u2019 s body was found on the day of his murder , May 9 , 1978 .\nThe P2 Lodge has been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The response of the Italian government \u2013 and indeed , the Italian public \u2013 to the kidnapping and murder of a former Prime Minister was sweeping and had consequences far beyond a simple winding down of the Italian Years of Lead .\nFirst and foremost , the Historic Compromise brokered between the Christian Democracy and the Italian Communist Party was over .\nIt had been unpopular with Italy \u2019 s European allies .\nBut the kidnapping of a man considered the natural next president of the republic killed it stone dead .\nThe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ major parties to rule in a grand coalition .\nThe Historic Compromise officially ended in November 1980 .\nThe president , Giovanni Leone , resigned less than a month after the kidnapping .\nThe government \u2019 s response was largely seen as a failure .\nThe Communist Party declined in influence , while the Christian Democracy remained steady until the early 90s , when it began to be supplanted by the more popular Lega Nord , now known simply as the Lega .\nIt is worth noting that , much as the MSI @ @ @ @ @ @ @ groups , so too were the far-left terrorist groups largely opposed by the Communist Party and outright despised by trade unionists .\nOddly , despite a massive government clampdown , 1979 was the bloodiest year of the Years of Lead , with 659 attacks , including 11 assassinations .\nAmong the victims that year were four policemen , a Lieutenant Colonel of the carabinieri , a trade unionist , a bartender and investigative journalist , a judge , and a university student .\nAll of these were committed by leftist terrorist groups .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ teachers and five students in the legs that year .\n1980 topped 1979 in terms of assassinations with a total of 17 .\nThe victims that year included five policemen , a carabinieri general , a petrochemical manager , a cook , four judges , a security guard , and a journalist .\nPrima Linea even turned on one of its own that year , killing William Vaccher on suspicion of treason to the group .\nAll but one of these were committed by left-wing groups .\nWhile the Italian left had been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new group on the far-right , the Nuclei Armati Rivoluzionari , formed by dissident members of the Italian Social Movement explicitly with the purpose of committing counter-attacks against the left , was planning something big \u2013 the Bologna Massacre .\nThis bombing of the Bologna Centrale train station killed 85 and wounded more than 200 .\nWhile the group denied involvement , several of its members were sentenced for the bombing .\nChristian Democratic Prime Minister Francesco Cossiga \u2019 s statement on the attack cuts to the heart of the difference between the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Lead : In short , the strategy of the left was more akin to a Third World guerilla insurrection , while the right hoped to provoke the state into clamping down on the left through false flags and other large-scale acts of terrorism .\nTwo members of the NAR were convicted , Francesca Mambro and Giuseppe Valerio \u201c Giusva \u201d Fioravanti , the latter a former Italian child actor .\nThe pair later married and had a daughter .\nBoth admit to having committed terrorist acts , but maintain their innocence with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Years of Lead Wind Down Left-wing violence in Italy related to the Years of Lead continued as far as 1988 .\nHowever , after the Bologna Massacre , things had died down considerably .\n1981 saw three kidnappings resulting in two murders .\nThe third , the kidnapping of American General James L. Dozier , then deputy-chief of NATO \u2019 s Southern European forces , was freed by an anti-terrorist squad .\nIn 1982 , the Red Brigades attacked a military convoy , killing a corporal and two police officers .\nThe assailants @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , two guards were killed by Red Brigades during a bank robbery .\n1983 was completely quiet , and thus might be a good place to mark the end of the Years of Lead proper .\nHowever , in 1984 , American diplomat and Director General of international peacekeeping force , Multinational Force and Observers , Leamon Hunt , was killed by the Red Brigades .\nIn 1985 , the Red Brigades killed an economist and a policeman .\nIn 1986 , they assassinated the Mayor of Florence .\nItalian Air Force General @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in 1987 .\nIn 1988 , the Red Brigades committed their final assassination , that of Senator Roberto Ruffilli .\nOn October 23rd of that year , the Red Brigades declared that their war against the state was over .\nIn 1985 , French President Francois Mitterand declared that he would not extradite convicted terrorists back to Italy .\nInstead , he aimed to integrate them into French society .\nBrazil and Nicaragua have likewise provided safe haven for left-wing terrorists of the Italian Years of Lead , most notably Alessio Casimirri , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ owns a restaurant in Nicaragua .\nEpilogue : The P2 Affair and the Strategy of Tension While the players were mostly firmly identifiable either as being on the left or on the right , one group played both sides : The shadowy Masonic Lodge in exile Propaganda Due , also known as the P2 Lodge .\nWhile the very mention of Freemasonry generally has people reaching for their tin foil hats , the P2 Lodge \u2019 s involvement in the Years of Lead \u2013 and other clandestine machinations within the Italian State \u2013 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ obstruction and obfuscation of the resulting investigations .\nThe P2 Lodge and the extent of its influence was discovered in March 1981 , when police found a list of 962 alleged members , including future Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi and pretender to the Italian throne Victor Emmanuel .\nThe ensuing scandal forced the resignation of the Italian government at the time .\nIn July 1982 , the ultimate aims of the Lodge were discovered , two documents entitled \u201c Memorandum sulla situazione italiana \u201d and \u201c Piano di rinascita democratica.\n\u201d These documents @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trade unions as the biggest threats , proposing a grand alliance between the Christian Democrats and the Communists as the way forward .\nIt also outlined a means to control the media and political parties through extensive bribery .\nA government report commissioned by the successors of the Communist Party , the Left Democrats , as well as Swiss historian Daniele Ganser have claimed that the Years of Lead were in large part the result of a \u201c strategy of tension \u201d by NATO , the CIA , Gladio and their allies ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is where actors , generally in the government , create or allow a state of hostility for the purpose of making political capital out of it .\nIt is entirely possible that the Years of Lead occurred due to a purposeful lack of action on the part of the Italian government , which saw the chaos as an opportunity for greater power .\nAmerica is a long way from its own Years of Lead .\nWhat

Shabak , is engaged in the brutal torture of Palestinian detainees , despite the practice being against both Israeli and international law .\nThe new accusations , deemed \u201c very credible \u201d by both Israeli and Palestinian rights groups , come amid a recorded spike in the use of torture on Palestinian detainees by Israeli authorities .\nThe latest cases involve three Palestinian men who were detained as part of the extensive manhunt that followed an August 23 bombing that killed an Israeli settler @ @ @ @ @ @ @ men , living in the occupied West Bank , were detained per Israel \u2019 s controversial practice of \u201c administrative detention , \u201d whereby Israel may detain an individual for months or even years without charging them with a crime .\nThe lawyers and family members of the three main suspects have asserted that all three men suspected of links to the bombing had been tortured to the point of needing hospitalization , with one of them being admitted for kidney failure and 11 broken ribs before subsequently being returned to the custody @ @ @ @ @ @ @ men had his genitals bitten by a security dog while the third man was wheelchair-bound and unrecognizable to his wife when he appeared in a courtroom .\nWhile these three Palestinian men \u2019 s experiences are extreme cases , the same Shin Bet investigation also tortured several other detainees in less severe ways but nonetheless left them traumatized .\nThose detainees were released after weeks in detention and were never charged .\nShin Bet also arrested family members of detainees and , in some cases , paraded them in front of detainees in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wives and children would also undergo the same harsh treatment .\nThough the manhunt and resulting torture of Palestinian suspects took place months ago , reporting on the incidents was delayed due to an Israeli court-mandated gag order that was renewed multiple times since it was first issued last September .\nThat gag order , in effect for well over three months , also made court proceedings of the three main suspects in the case closed to the public and prevented family members from attending court , with few exceptions .\nThe alleged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ August 23 bombing occurred during a period when the use of torture of West Bank Palestinians by Shin Bet spiked dramatically , according to the Palestinian prisoner rights organization Adameer , which issued a report last month that contained hard evidence of \u201c the systematic use of torture and ill-treatment \u201d against Palestinian detainees at the Al-Mascobiyya interrogation center .\nThe torture of detainees , though often denied by Israeli officials , is technically illegal .\nYet , a loophole provided in the same 1999 Israeli Supreme Court ruling that made the practice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as the ruling only prohibited torture of detainees unless there was suspicion of an imminent attack .\nThis loophole has routinely been used by Shin Bet , especially given that Shin Bet officials who engage in the practice have done so for decades with impunity .\nIndeed , while over one thousand official complaints against the Shin Bet related to its use of torture have been filed since 2001 , only one has ever gone to court \u2014 a 2017 case which is still open .\nIn addition , the use of torture @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doctors who work with Shin Bet by approving brutal interrogation tactics , falsifying medical reports and engaging in other activities that provide justifications for the use of extreme and internationally-condemned interrogation methods .\nTheir support would also likely help protect Shin Bet officials in the event that more of these torture cases ever went to court .\nOne likely reason for the culture of the impunity is the tacit approval of a large portion of the Israeli populace regarding the use of torture on those deemed \u201c enemy combatants.\n\u201d For instance , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of 20 and 35 conducted in 16 countries last month found that Israeli youths were by far the most supportive of the use of torture , with only 23 percent of Israeli respondents opposing the practice , compared to the international average of 55 percent .\nAs to why the last few months have seen a spike in reports of the torture of Palestinian prisoners , the answer is not entirely clear .\nOne possible explanation could be related to the U.S.-Israeli push to enact the so-called \u201c Deal of the Century \u201d @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Israeli that has seen the country awaiting its third

reason organs from these individuals are highly prized is that they don \u2019 t smoke , don \u2019 t consume alcohol @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be young .\nThe individuals are executed in such a way as to keep the body alive so surgeons can harvest the organs in the freshest state !\nThe video discusses the documentary Human Harvest which looks at forced organ harvesting in China and is designed to bring more international attention to this issue and to bring more pressure on China to stop these murders for profit .\nIt shows that what China is doing is comparable to what the Nazis did in World War II .\nThe group \u201c Doctors Against @ @ @ @ @ @ @ event where the documentary was shown .\nWhen Jennifer Zeng spoke to the tribunal , she said , \u201c I hope more countries will pass laws to forbid their citizens from going to China to do organ transplants .\nAnd I do hope the international world will figure out a way to stop the killing in China right now.\n\u201d No One in China Believes in Communism Now , According to Zeng In the video \u201c I Interview Jennifer Zeng who talks about her torture in a Chinese labor camp \u201d seen below @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Falun Gong practitioners exercised in the parks for two hours before work .\nLater , because more people were practicing Falun Gong than were in the Communist Party , the government became afraid that it was a growing and powerful social movement that could overthrow it .\nSo , it began to crack down .\nShe explains that when the Falun Gong learned in 1999 that the government planned to crack down , 10,000 practitioners went to the government to petition but were arrested and detained in a sports stadium .\nThere was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Beijing .\nJennifer explains that Communism has a history of persecuting different types of people every 10 years .\nWhen the Chinese Communist Party was founded in 1949 , it first killed at least hundreds of thousands of landlords .\nThe Party killed all the landlords in the country \u2014 saying they were \u201c bad people \u201d .\nThe Party took over their land and gave it to the poor people .\nThen , several years later , the Party moved to the cities and killed many small business owners .\nNext , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Party killed at least a half million so-called \u201c intellectuals \u201d or jailed them for 20 years .\nDuring the Cultural Revolution , at least seven million people were killed !\nIn the Great Leap Forward , at least 30-40 million people starved to death .\nMore recently was the Tiananmen Massacre .\nJennifer points out that the Party has systematically destroyed the traditional religions , the traditional culture , and the traditional values which have been in China for thousands of years .\nThe Party killed people who refused to adopt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She points out that the Communist Party gained power through violence and deceit and was never elected by the people .\nSo , the Party has a fundamental fear about its legitimacy .\nFor that reason , it periodically targets five percent of the population to maintain a level of fear .\nShe says that it was not strange that Falun Gong was targeted .\nIt was just its turn .\nThe difference is that this group has its own strong belief system and so is not willing to just transform or give @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in China believes in communism any more .\nNow , the party wants people to focus on material interests and to focus on the acquisition of money .\nPeople like that are easy for the Party to control .\nPeople who value money can be more easily corrupted .\nSo , the Party was threatened by the fact that the Falun Gong were pursuing spiritual values rather than material ones .\nThe Party knew that since the Falun Gong practitioners don \u2019 t believe in money , they can \u2019 t be controlled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rid of them .\nThe Party launched a huge propaganda campaign against the Falun Gong in newspapers , TV , radio , etc .\nThe Party targeted whomever they thought were leaders inside Falun Gong .\nEveryone understood that anyone who continued practicing Falun Gong could lose their job or end up in jail .\nInitially , the Party thought that if it put Falun Gong practitioners in jail for 10-30 days that would scare them into giving up .\nHowever , people who had practiced Falun Gong for many years believed in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Forbearance .\nSo , many practitioners were not willing to give up .\nThe Communist Party considered the Falun Gong an \u201c evil cult \u201d and fed the public many terrible lies about Falun Gong to make people think that practitioners are crazy .\nSince all the media in China is controlled by the government , it \u2019 s easy for the Party to control the minds of most people .\nThe government has spent billions of dollars to set up a \u201c firewall \u201d to block free access to the internet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ believe whatever the government wants them to believe .\nJennifer explained that sometimes police wanted to identify members of the public who were Falun Gong practitioners .\nSo , for example , on a train , they would ask someone to curse , to say dirty words because that would not be a problem for most Chinese .\nSo , if the person refused , they would assume the person was a Falun Gong practitioner !\nThat was one of the many methods the police used to try to stop people from going @ @ @ @ @ @ @ practitioners .\nSo , the Party escalated the persecution by putting Falun Gong practitioners in labor camps .\nSome people were sentenced for 10 years .\nThe Party even killed some practitioners to harvest their organs !\nThat has now become an industrialized practice in China which has made huge amount of money .\nMillions of people may have been killed in the last 17 years .\nJennifer explained that before she began practicing Falun Gong , she suffered from Hepatitis C and was in very , very poor health .\nPracticing Falun @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feels that Falun Gong saved her life and gave her a second chance , she would not give it up .\nJennifer said that the first time she was arrested , she heard a knock on her door at 2 o \u2019 clock in the morning and the police took her away without any explanation .\nAfter a week , the police showed her a letter she had emailed her mother to explain why Falun Gong is good and she didn \u2019 t want to give it up .\nJennifer explained that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ letter !\nThere were no lawyers , no trial , no defense , and no sentence .\nIt was just a decision to put her in a labor camp which is worse than a jail because there are no regulations .\nThe police made it clear that they were sentenced to the labor camps for the purpose of \u201c reforming \u201d them , to get them to give up their beliefs .\nIf they didn \u2019 t , endless torture started .\nIf the police were not able to reform the Falun Gong @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nSo , they forced real criminals to torture Falun Gong practitioners .\nIf the criminals refused to participate in the torture , their sentences would be lengthened .\nIf they agreed to engage in the torture , they could be released early .\nIt was a form of brainwashing which was designed to convince the practitioners that Falun Gong is evil .\nPractitioners were required to denounce Falun Gong publicly .\nIn addition , practitioners were required to help the police torture other Falun Gong practitioners !\nPeople who refused to \u201c @ @ @ @ @ @ @ To Believe Jennifer explained that , to her , the physical persecution was nothing because she still knew in her mind , heart , and spirit who she was .\nHowever , the police wanted to destroy practitioners \u2019 moral values and spirit \u2013 the very essence of what makes a person human .\nThey want to turn a human being into a non-human being .\nJennifer says that people who are killed physically can die with dignity .\nHowever , the goal of the police is to take away people \u2019 s @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is the most evil part of the persecution .\nHowever , the government realizes that people who have practiced Falun Gong know that it is good .\nSo , even if they are arrested , they will later continue practicing Falun Gong .\nFor that reason , there is a policy that if the police release a practitioner and that person goes back to Falun Gong within three years , those police would be fined up to half a year \u2019 s salary !\nSo , if the police release practitioners without really @ @ @ @ @ @ @ put themselves in danger !\nFor that reason , the police would prefer to torture practitioners to death !\nIf the police could not \u201c reform \u201d a practitioner through the use of violence , they resorted to sleep deprivation .\nUntil a practitioner \u201c reformed \u201d , no sleep would be allowed .\nJennifer said when she was in the labor camp , the longest period she was aware of was 15 days and nights without sleep .\nThat drove many people insane and broke many people down .\nThey became like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ physically alive , but mentally and spiritually , they knew nothing .\nThey were just crazy .\nLater , the police used practitioners as \u201c organ banks \u201d and killed them to harvest their organs for sale internationally .\nThat way , the police did not have to worry about the people still believing in Falun Gone and they could also make huge amounts of money .\nWhen Jennifer was transferred from the detention center to the labor camp , she was first taken to a clinic where she was given a medical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the labor camp for a month , she and others were taken to a huge hospital where they were given a more thorough physical checkup , including an X-ray .\nAlso , everyone in the labor camps was given a blood test .\nHowever , they were never told the results or the purpose of the tests .\nJennifer realized only years later after she was released that the tests were to allow for organ matches with potential recipients .\nIf anyone from anywhere needed an organ , the police could search that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then kill that person on demand to harvest his/her organs for sale .\nThat \u2019 s why the police can promise on their website that they can find a match for anyone within two weeks !\nSo , sometimes a heart transplant can be pre-scheduled .\nBecause Jennifer used to have Hepatitis C , she was an unsuitable donor .\nThat may have helped save her life .\nJennifer was shocked in the beginning .\nHowever , after six months in the labor camp , she decided that she would write a book @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to record the events and to give the world a first-hand account of what \u2019 s happening in the labor camps .\nFor the next six months , the commitment to write the book caused a conflict that nearly killed her .\nOn one hand , Jennifer wanted to be released so she could write the book .\nHowever , to get released , she would have to betray her conscience and give up her beliefs .\nTo do that was worse than the physical torture she experienced .\nJennifer has been reluctant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the camp .\nShe hopes that no other human being will ever have to suffer what she suffered .\nTo get out , Jennifer had to violate her conscience .\nThat left her feeling ashamed of herself to such an extent that she no longer wanted to write the book and she cried for at least 20 days .\nJennifer says that the abuse continues to affect many practitioners after they are released .\nSo , the police succeed in continuing to harm people .\nLater , Jennifer realized that if she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the world would never know how evil this persecution really is .\nWhen she was released in 2002 , Jennifer fled to Australia .\nAfter witnessing so much inhumanity in the labor camp , she felt an obligation to write a book to tell the world what is going on .\nShe points out that after World War II , the world vowed never to let what happened to the Jews in the Nazi concentration camps occur again .\nHowever , it is happening again in a disguised way on a very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nWhen Jennifer escaped to Australia , she was able to publish her book in Chinese and English .\nAs far as Jennifer is aware , her book is the only one written by a Falun Gong practitioner who has been in a labor camp .\nIt is very important for humanity to understand what \u2019 s happening .\nHer hope is that this kind of persecution will never happen to another human being .\nJennifer says she escaped communism in China , but now fears it has followed her to America in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nShe Survived China \u2019 s Forced Labor Camp .\nNow She \u2019 s Urging Americans to Reject Socialism contains an audio in which Jennifer urges Americans to reject socialism now .\nJennifer \u2019 s very moving and powerful documentary is called Free China : The Courage to Believe .\nIt is available as a DVD and on Amazon Prime Video .\nThe film is being released in China for free and can break through China \u2019 s Great Internet Firewall .\nThe documentary shows that if China does not become free , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nThe film explains that the government initially supported Falun Gong because practitioners are law-abiding and healthy .\nIt turned against the practice not just because Falun Gong began to outnumber members of the Communist Party , but because the military was also joining .\nThe documentary explains that since the Party runs on corruption , it can \u2019 t function if the military follows the spiritual practices of Falun Gong .\nSo , the Party had to reverse itself and suppress Falun Gong .\nHowever , the Party could have just forbidden @ @ @ @ @ @ @ So , perhaps another reason the Party has detained so many practitioners is for the gruesome \u201c Human Harvest \u201d .", "author": "Activist Post", "url":

Activist Post does not endorse any specific candidate in the U.S. presidential election .\nOur only goal is to present a diversity of opinions about the ideologies behind political systems .\nBernie Sanders seems to be getting a lot of support from people who think they want \u201c socialism \u201d in America , especially the young people , many of whom know nothing about what socialism really is .\nThere is a lot of misinformation out there , including the assertion that Sweden and other Nordic countries are \u201c socialist , \u201d which they aren \u2019 t because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the private ownership of the means of production .\nSo , those countries are capitalist countries but with a large welfare state , just like the U.S .\nBut the truth is , actual socialism has a history of economic stagnation and impoverishment , tyranny , and political oppression .\nThe \u201c equality \u201d that Bernie supporters are looking for does not exist in socialist societies .\nIn such socialist societies the political class are the elites who climb the ladder of success based on political favoritism and corruption , not based on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nThe political class are the rulers and the rest of the people are their servants , quite frankly .\nSo Bernie is running on a platform to \u201c tax the billionaires \u201d to pay for all the socialist programs he wants to impose .\nBut Bernie has also said he wants to eliminate the billionaires ( until there are no more billionaires to tax , and thus no more wealth to fund his schemes ! )\n.\nThe truth is , these politicians , demagogues , and propagandists such as Bernie are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and they oppose freedom , even though it was freedom that most contributed to the biggest expansion in growth and progress in human history and the biggest rise in the standard of living of all ( and not just the \u201c 1 % \u201d or the \u201c rich \u201d or billionaires , but everyone ) .\nMore than guided by motivations of charity , giving and compassion , the Bernie socialists seem guided by envy and covetousness in their expressed desire to take other people \u2019 s money and stuff away from them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the process for them by imposing the income tax and empowering the IRS .\nAnd the truth is , socialism is anything but \u201c social.\n\u201d It is in fact anti-social .\nSocialism is antithetical to peace , and has no place for the peacefulness of voluntary exchange .\nSocialists impose policies of coercion , compulsion , and government theft of private wealth , government exploitation of your labor .\nMany people agree with the policies of aggression against peaceful people , from the antifa demonstrators who beat up MAGA hat-wearing Trump supporters @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drug laws .\nAnd Project Veritas showed that some Bernie supporters are threatening to burn down Milwaukee and other cities if Bernie doesn \u2019 t get the Democrat nomination .\nBut these people merely reflect the actual government policies they support .\nSocialism requires a heavy dose of State power and aggression over the people and a powerful police state , goons with badges and guns , to enforce the bureaucrats \u2019 iron fist .\nThe differences between socialism and freedom ?\nUnlike in the private sector in which all transactions , trades @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the use of coercion with threats of force are considered criminal , under socialism the transactions between government and the workers are involuntary .\nYou must obey the government \u2019 s demands for whatever it wants , or else .\nAnd the U.S. quickly became this kind of society after the income tax was imposed in the early 20th Century .\nWhich is what enabled the aforementioned enrichment of the ruling class in Washington .\n( Hence Bernie \u2019 s three homes and $ 2 million in wealth .\nBut what has he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ return ?\nNothing , quite frankly . )\nAnd it is not just the \u201c rich \u201d who are robbed by the government , it is everyone .\nEither through direct taxation or indirectly via inflation and a central bank such as the Federal Reserve System .\nSo we have to decide whether we want to live in a free society , a society of peace and prosperity , or not .\nThe socialist society , or in the U.S. the \u201c mixed economy \u201d as it is sometimes called , requires the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nWhat exactly is freedom , as compared to the enslavement of the government-owned and controlled economy under socialism ?\nIn freedom , you own your life and your body .\nNot the government .\nYou own your labor and all the energy and effort you put into your productivity , until you voluntarily sell your labor to an employer , a client or customer .\nAnd you thus own the earnings or compensation that are paid to you voluntarily by such employers , clients or customers , which are based on mutually @ @ @ @ @ @ @ era , more freedom has led to the periods of the greatest growth and expansion , and raised the standard of living of all in society .\nSocialism and less freedom have a history of reducing the standard of living of the people .\nFor example , we still have generally a lot of freedom in the tech sector now , unlike the healthcare and some other sectors .\nThe reason you have a very modern and convenient iPhone and other little gadgets is because of that freedom .\nAll the advances and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as inventions in other areas , came from that freedom and free markets .\nThey did not come from socialism .\nWhat inventions , exactly , came from the socialist Soviet Union ?\nFrom Cuba , North Korea , or Iran ?\nAnd healthcare in the U.S. , for example , right now is not nearly as free and affordable as it used to be .\nWhat happened ?\nThe government came in during the 1960s and imposed Medicare and Medicaid .\nThose interventions , mandates and intrusions distorted the markets in healthcare @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the increase in costs in healthcare .\nPrior to those intrusions , if someone was unable to afford to go to a doctor or hospital , it was affordable for doctors to provide medical care for people for free , which many did .\nThere was much more freedom of healthcare in general in the old days , as well .\nDoctor-patient confidentiality was also more secure .\nGovernmental intrusions have compromised that , too .\nAnother example of the destruction of socialism is Venezuela , which Bernie enthusiastically praises .\nIn Venezuela @ @ @ @ @ @ @ means of production of food .\nFood production and distribution are under the ownership and control of the government .\nAnd what happened ?\nThe government distortions in those markets gave the Venezuelan people empty store shelves , long lines , mass starvation , violence , corruption , and death .\nIn contrast , look at all the store shelves in grocery stores in the U.S .\nFully stocked , most of the time , with many , many choices , all as a result of private ownership of food production and distribution @ @ @ @ @ @ @ running those industries to do what they think is right at whatever given time , not based on what a bureaucrat demands .\nIn socialism the government owns the means of production .\nAnd what is the most important means of production ?\nThe people , of course .\nIn socialist societies you do not own your own life and your labor \u2019 s earnings .\nThe government is the initial , primary owner of your labor and the government gives to you whatever it thinks you deserve .\nMeanwhile , when there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ freedom to keep more of what you earn , businesses expand more and the workers are getting better pay and benefits so they can afford that car , a new refrigerator , etc .\nA recent example : the tax cuts of December , 2017 in the U.S. that were followed by companies immediately announcing their workers \u2019 raises and bonuses .\nIn a genuinely free society the companies are privately owned and the capital of the private manufacturers and investors is free from government theft .\nThis leaves the people free to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ produce better goods and services to better serve the consumers .\nFreedom is one big reason why people in the society can afford to have an iPhone , a TV , a car , and air conditioning .\nIn contrast , when the State owns and runs production and industry , which is what Bernie Sanders wants ( like in modern Cuba and the old Soviet Union ) , government bureaucrats decide what you will do with your life and career ( tracking kids from kindergarten to college , etc. )\n.\nThat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no freedom and your right to self-ownership is usurped away by the rulers , i.e .\na slave of the State .\nAnd in such socialist societies there is no political freedom including the right to \u201c question authority \u201d and challenge the State \u2019 s abuses .\nGiven that the U.S. is very socialist in the kinds of powers and controls the federal government already has , it \u2019 s no wonder the regime in Washington railroads anyone who rocks the establishment boat , from Donald Trump to political prisoners Edward Snowden @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In socialist societies that Amerika had become long ago but many people aren \u2019 t willing or able to acknowledge , you can see how political power over others and the political process is an obsession .\nLook how members of the political class are climbing and grasping for power with the current 2020 elections .\nThe two major parties , Republican and Democrat , a.k.a .\nRepublicrat and Demopublican , are really a racket .\nThey are really a branch of the government , federal , state and local .\nJust look @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the right of third parties or independent candidates to get their names on ballots .\nAnd the media , by the way , are another branch of the government , as their propaganda mainly repeats the government \u2019 s word without question .\nAnti-establishment media people are \u201c heretics , \u201d \u201c unpatriotic , \u201d \u201c Russia puppets , \u201d and censored by mainstream media , or \u201c de-platformed \u201d by the government \u2019 s social media minions .\nAnd , while Donald Trump in many ways is also an authoritarian socialist , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the permanent extra-constitutional national security state and bureaucratic state went after him , just because he said , \u201c Drain the Swamp.\n\u201d Just look how the State \u2019 s criminals of government made things up , like \u201c golden showers \u201d and concocted a Steele Dossier to falsely accuse and frame-up a duly elected U.S. president .\nAnd when that didn \u2019 t work , they then made up more \u201c crimes \u201d from a mere phone call toward an impeachment , and that didn \u2019 t work either .\nAnd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are just as bad as the \u201c strategizing \u201d Democrats .\nSome of the conservative talk radio hosts and their ditto-head callers are saying they will vote in Democrat primaries for Bernie .\nBut how did Rush Limbaugh \u2019 s \u201c Operation Chaos \u201d work out ?\n( It gave us Obama ! )\nYou see , this is how things are when everything in life is politicized in a socialist society .\nThe conservatives , by the way , love socialism when it comes to the immigration issue .\nThey love the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attempting to control the movements of millions of people , which is impossible .\nThe Rush Limbaugh crowd loves having the government restrict the rights and freedom of foreigners entering \u201c our \u201d country , entering the socialized and \u201c publicly-owned \u201d territory of Amerika and imposing a police state on everyone at or near the border .\nIn that kind of socialism that conservatives love , you have to get the government \u2019 s permission to get a job somewhere or to hire someone .\nIn contrast , in a free society @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , they go to where a job is available and they buy or rent a home where they want to live , and employers just hire the best person for the job .\nNo permission from a parasite bureaucrat in Washington needed .\nIn a free society , you do what you want to do with your own life , your labor and property , as long as you are peaceful and don \u2019 t violate the persons or property of others .\nNot complicated .\nAnd in a free society , there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u201d You own your own body and consume whatever you decide , and you \u2019 re responsible for your own decisions and actions .\nBut when life is socialized , the government is empowered to own and control everything , including you .\nCurrently in Amerika , the government owns your body and bureaucrats decide what you may or may not put into \u201c your \u201d body .\nIn a free society , if you want to use , buy or sell a plastic bag , then you use , buy or sell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you don \u2019 t litter .\nPeople littering is the real problem as far as environmental issues are concerned , not plastics per se .\nIn a free society no one may go to government bureaucrats to ban plastic , or ban anything for that matter .\nNo banning drugs by law , no banning sugary drinks or salt , no banning guns , no bans on otherwise peaceful activities .\nSo a free society is a \u201c leave people the hell alone \u201d society .\nWhether the Bernie , Bloomberg or Trump @ @ @ @ @ @ @ !\nAnd in a free society , you educate your children however you want .\nAnd when there is freedom , there would be many more schools and choices , and the government doesn \u2019 t run the schools .\nNo federal Department of Education , no local school committees .\nAnd it \u2019 s all voluntary .\nNo compulsory education .\nIn a free society , if your child wants to have a lemonade stand , she has a lemonade stand .\nNothing a local official or neighbor can do about it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on your own private property .\nIf you want to drive a cab and offer people rides , you put \u201c TAXI \u201d on top and drive your cab and offer people rides .\nYou don \u2019 t get a bureaucrat \u2019 s permission .\nYou don \u2019 t pay the government a fee .\nYou just do it .\nAnd in a free society there is freedom of speech , freedom of religion , freedom of movement , freedom of self-defense , and due process .\nSadly , there is no room @ @ @ @ @ @ @ socialist society .\nScott Lazarowitz is a libertarian writer and commentator .\nPlease visit his blog .\nSubscribe to Activist Post for truth

safe-haven demand for gold and silver .\nThe major market moving event was , of course , the Federal Reserve \u2019 s emergency rate cut on Tuesday .\nThe Fed slashed its overnight funds rate by 50 basis points .\nBut even before the Fed acted , the bond market had already forced its hand as yields on the 10-year Treasury note plunged to record low levels .\nBy Friday morning , the 10-year treasury yielded less than a paltry 0.90 % .\nThat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the risk involved .\nBond buyers are apparently willing to make a decade-long bet on U.S. government finances remaining solid and inflation remaining extremely low .\nIt \u2019 s still possible for bonds to experience capital appreciation if rates ultimately head to zero or below \u2013 as they have already done in other parts of the world .\nThe Fed is almost certain to cut rates again .\nThere is a good chance at least some portion of the yield curve will be at zero later in the year .\nAs central bankers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the U.S. dollar is likely to come under downside pressure .\nIf for no other reason than the Fed still has room to cut rates further while much of the rest of the developed world has already run out of conventional tools to depreciate their currencies .\nThere has been lots of talk of \u201c coordinated action \u201d among world central banks .\nPerhaps they will all get together and roll out some sort of global quantitative easing or other unconventional form of stimulus .\nSince zero and even negative interest rates haven @ @ @ @ @ @ @ maybe they will just try dropping cash out of helicopters \u2013 or whatever the digital equivalent may be .\nGold is emerging as the strongest currency in the world since the outbreak of the coronavirus .\nAlthough the monetary metal got hammered in futures markets in last Friday \u2019 s trading , it has quickly recouped those losses .\nGold is showing tremendous relative strength versus the stock market , which continues to swing wildly on a daily basis .\nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average has so far suffered just a sharp correction @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just a month ago that the blue-chip average was hitting new record highs .\nBut when measured in term of gold , the Dow is in a major bear market .\nIn fact , the Dow : gold ratio dropped this week to a 3-year low of 15.6:1 .\nAnother ratio we monitor closely is the gold : silver ratio .\nIt is now trading at an extreme high of about 96:1 .\nYou \u2019 d have to go all the way back to 1991 to find gold selling at a more elevated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ briefly .\nIf coronavirus fears continue to drive markets , then gold could potentially spike to 100 times the silver price .\nBut we suspect that when markets finally calm down and prospects for the global economy improve , silver will begin playing catch-up to gold .\nAnd it has a long way to go to get back to a more historically typical relationship with its more prestigious counterpart .\nWe are also seeing a big surge in demand for silver bullion products .\nThe U.S. Mint reported that it sold 675,000 Silver @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of March .\nBy comparison , it supplied dealers with just 650,000 Silver Eagles for the entire

Romney\u2019s Fraudster Michael Milken", "content": "U.S. President Donald Trump recently issued a shocking pardon of his long-time friend the \u201c junk bond king \u201d , Michael Milken , who also happens to be one of Mitt Romney \u2019 s bag holders who helped finance Bain Capital deals .\nMilken was the pioneer starting the industry of buying and selling lowly rated corporate \u201c junk \u201d debt .\nIn 1989 , authorities said he illegally used inside knowledge of the debt being used in corporate takeover deals to make plays in the stocks of the related companies enriching himself and his clients .\nMilken was convicted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1989 of six charges including securities fraud and insider trading by then-famed prosecutor Rudolph Giuliani .\nBefore the plea deal , originally Milken was charged with 98 counts of racketeering , securities fraud , and other crimes .\nInstead , he received just 10 years which was later reduced to 2 years and a $ 600 million dollar fine after pleading guilty to five violations of securities and reporting regulations , as the NY Times reported .\n\u201c I transgressed certain of the laws and regulations that govern our industry .\nI was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at that time and I am pleading guilty to these offenses , \u201d Milken said at his plea hearing .\nThe NY Times added at the time that , \u201c In essence , Mr. Milken admitted to cheating some Drexel customers , aiding others in the violation of securities and tax laws , and manipulating the securities market to benefit a client.\n\u201d In a recent OpED for the Washington Post , the lead prosecutor on Milken \u2019 s case John K. Caroll writes : However , most don \u2019 t know that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to fund the business of Mitt Romney \u2019 s Stage Stores .\nAs reported by Rolling Stone \u2019 s September 2012 cover story ( \u201c Greed and Debt : The True Story About Mitt Romney and Bain Capital \u201d ) , The Boston Globe detailed Romney \u2019 s Stage Stores formation was funded by Michael Milken \u2019 s junk bonds ; and that a conflicted Judge Pollack presiding over Milken \u2019 s case allowed Romney to utilize the money despite the fact that the judge \u2019 s wife , Moselle Pollack , stood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own dealings .\nFurthermore , Rolling Stone pointed out that Kay Bee CEO ( Michael Glazer ) paid himself an $ 18 million back pay , after paying Bain Capital $ 83 million \u2013 prior to Kay Bee \u2019 s 2004 bankruptcy .\nAmong the issues of whether or not anyone else could haul out $ 100 million prior to filing bankruptcy \u2013 Rolling Stone missed reporting the fact that Michael Glazer was also simultaneously a Director at Romney \u2019 s Stage Stores during the bankruptcy .\n( As a matter of fact @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now become CEO of Stage Stores , Bloomberg reported . )\nAfter Milken was charged and imprisoned , he was permanently barred from the securities industry .\nHowever , in 1991 , the Securities and Exchange Commission accused him of violating his lifetime ban , alleging he offered advice to Murdoch and Perelman .\nMilken settled the SEC complaint for $ 47 million in 1998 ; no new criminal charges were brought against him .\nStill some argue that Milken \u201c deserved a pardon , \u201d for reasons not understood by this writer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , again , in 2008 ; and eToys was also in its 3rd bankruptcy , as part of a separate item of \u201c The Parent Company \u201d insolvency case ( in 2008 ) .\nThe outrageous thing is that both Kay Bee & eToys wound back up , under Bain Capital \u2013 again ; but this time as part of Toys R Us .\nNow they are all in bankruptcy , once more .\nEven stranger is the fact that those previous cases have questions about massive frauds being protected by willfully blind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was pointed out by a whistleblower this reporter has come into contact with who has been fighting for justice .\nThis whistleblower , Laser Haas , has been stonewalled by the DOJ and the media alike .\nThis recent pardon also shows that despite Romney being the only Republican senator to vote to impeach Trump , the two aren \u2019 t enemies .\nOtherwise , why would Trump pardon Michael Milken who has aided in Romney \u2019 s scheme with Stage Stores ?\nSerial Wall St whistleblower Laser Haas has long said that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just a stage show .\nAs further evidence of this , the Trump administration is even obstructing a lawsuit against Goldman Sachs and Bain Capital by Laser Haas that would open up both firms to massive frauds being exposed .\nIt may surprise readers , but actually all of the above is correct .\nTrump was once sued alongside Mike Milken for participating in a scheme to artificially inflate junk bond prices .\nTrump has also deregulated Wall St , largely removing investor protections from the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau , loosened regulations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to non-bank entities like insurers , ratings agencies , and hedge fund Vulture Capitalists like Bain Capital and Goldman Sachs .\nIn 2017 , President Trump was sued by whistleblower Laser Haas to block Jay Clayton from becoming head of the SEC .\nThe lawsuit included warnings about Colm Connolly ( who was a MNAT partner and a corrupt fed prosecutor ) .\nTrump ignored the lawsuit as the Washington , D.C .\nClerk hid the case from the public by stamping a giant \u201c F-Deck \u201d on the document until 3 weeks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ things worse , after Clayton was confirmed , Trump then proceeded to make Colm Connolly into a Delaware Federal District Court Judge ( who Senator Biden had stopped from becoming , 10 years earlier when he blocked him . )\nThis particular selection is very alarming .\nSo much so , that this reporter did a detailed r\u00e9sum\u00e9 story ( here ) about the facts of Colm Connolly being a federal prosecutor who protected Goldman Sachs & Bain Capital from federal investigation .\nLast month , the private government watchdog group Citizens for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ request to the U.S. Treasury Department for any messages between Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and any parties that contain the words \u201c pardon \u201d or any iterations of the word from January 2018 until last month .\nCREW noted in its Freedom of Information Act request that various news websites had reported that Mnuchin and others were advocating for a pardon for Milken , and that The New York Times had reported just last year that Mnuchin flew on Milken \u2019 s private airplane from Washington , D.C. , to Los Angeles .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ bond business in the \u2019 80s , issuing almost $ 700 million in junk bonds with a 14 % interest rate to finish construction on his Taj Mahal casino in Atlantic City , New Jersey .\nSince his release from prison , Milken has become known for his charity work .\nHe has funded a lot of research for cancer treatments and other illnesses considered to be life-threatening .\nIn 2007 , Fortune magazine called him \u201c The Man Who Changed Medicine.\n\u201d Milken was released from prison in 1993 .\nUsually crime @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you are Michael Milken or Mitt Romney and friends with unlimited get out of jail free cards from the DOJ , that sentiment is lost .\nMilken may even get a massive tax break thanks to a law Trump signed .\nAs , NYT writer , James B. Stewart writes : \u201c When it comes to justice , money counts .\nAnd white-collar crime doesn \u2019 t really matter.\n\u201d It \u2019 s worth mentioning for readers , Milken is the reason that the Insider Trading and Securities Fraud Enforcement Act ( ITSFEA @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before Congress in April 1988 ; just two weeks after that testimony , Representatives Dingell and Markey produced a new insider trading bill , increasing penalties for insider trading , penalizing firms that failed to police employee behavior , and awarding bounties to informants in securities fraud cases .\nIt is easy to be benevolent , to try to buy goodwill , with money that has been fleeced .\nAs for the horse manure assessment that white-collar crime doesn \u2019 t hurt anyone , why don \u2019 t we ask the more than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mattel , Hasbro , eToys , Kay Bee , FAO , Zainy Brainy , Gymboree , Toys R Us and eToys \u2013 how they feel ?\nMilken helped Romney formulate Stage Stores with junk bond monies by utilizing a conflicted judge ; and \u2013 since that time \u2013 bad faith judges willfully and corrupt federal prosecutors seem to , like clockwork , protect these racketeers .\nLike Michael Glazer being a tool of the organized crimes at both Kay Bee and eToys , while Glazer was at Stage Stores ; we have another @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bain Capital get away with organized crimes \u2013 by being a planted crook for Mattel .\nAs the racketeering enterprise expanded , Romney \u2019 s Bain Capital was able to rely on corrupt prosecutor Colm Connolly to be willfully blind to their Frank Nitti type guy , Paul Traub .\nAs this reporter noted , in December 2017 ( here ) Paul Roy Traub is Romney \u2019 s Frank Nitti ; and Traub is another shyster lawyer who aides agents in the rackets success .\nOnce Goldman Sachs and Bain Capital ripped off @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of their lawyers at MNAT lawfirm \u2013 Paul Traub , who worked for Romney \u2019 s Stage Stores bankruptcy , under Michael Glazer \u2013 did the ultimate Frank Nitti/Colm Connolly deceit .\nAfter ripping off Mattel for $ 4 billion \u2014 where Mitt \u2019 s contingency got a reported 12 million shares of Mattel \u2014 Mattel became a partner in the schemes and artifices to defraud ; because Mattel hired Paul Traub to be Mattel Creditors Committee attorney in the Kay Bee , FAO and eToys bankruptcy cases .\nThis is significant because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Tom Petter \u2019 s Ponzi scheme on the record , which means he was involved in these types of deals for years .\nTraub also had a U.S .\nTrustee Kelly Beaudin Stapleton Motion to Disgorge Traub \u2019 s law firm .\nThis is how Goldman Sachs and Bain Capital continue to escape justice .\nTheir lawyers , prosecutors , and judges are all in on making sure Goldman Sachs and Bain Capital get away scot-free with many billions of dollars in fraud ; with the purported victim Mattel being one there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the purported prosecutor of Al Capone .\nPaul Traub colluding with Colm Connolly is the very serious reason that Mitt Romney seeks to be \u201c retroactively \u201d retired from Mitt \u2019 s organized crimes ; because Laser Haas can prove those racketeering crimes began in 1999 through 2001 .\nPaul Traub was another nationally significant and important fact Taibbi missed in his \u201c Greed and Debt \u201d story .\nAccording to Laser Haas , Traub court docket records ( that clerks are making disappear ) proves beyond all doubt that Traub worked for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Gold , at Stage Stores , before working with Bain Cap to rip off eToys .\nTraub moved over to become the Kay Bee and eToys Attorney for the Creditors/Mattel as Chairman .\nThe law mandates that Paul Traub is supposed to be at 100 % \u2013 arm \u2019 s length and a good faith negotiator against Bain/Kay Bee .\nThe pattern of the racketeers is that Traub and federal prosecutor Colm Connolly worked in tandem to assure the Bankruptcy Fraud would succeed .\nSo it was easy , with corrupt federal prosecutor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Paul Traub to be the one who asked the Delaware Bankruptcy court for permission to be the prosecutor of Glazer and Bain for Michael Glazer taking out $ 100 million dollars prior to Glazer filing bankruptcy of Kay Bee .\nTraub did so after Colm Connolly was partners of MNAT representing Bain Capital in the Kay Bee case , while MNAT was simultaneously the Delaware Bankruptcy Court approved lawyers for Laser and eToys against Bain Cap/Kay Bee .\nAt the same time , while Traub and MNAT were doing dozens of acts of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crime , Paul Traub , to be the one to sue MNAT \u2019 s other ( secret ) client Goldman Sachs , in NY Supreme Court , for the billion dollar ripoff of eToys by Goldman Sachs .\nIn essence , Goldman Sachs sued Goldman Sachs in NY Supreme Court and eToys lost a billion dollars twice !\nTraub and MNAT illegally locked Laser out of eToys , as CEO and Traub \u2019 s partner ( Barry Gold ) , who also worked for Romney and Glazer at Stage Stores \u2013 was then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eToys , as CEO .\nLaser Haas notes that MNAT , GLAZER , BAIN/Kay Bee , Traub and Barry Gold then reduced the sales prices of eToys to sell to Bain/Kay Bee , which was reported by the NY Times .\nThen , Colm Connolly as the Delaware United States Attorney corruptly refused to prosecute this extremely serious RICO crime .\nEven more outrageous is the fact the Chief Justice of the Delaware Bankruptcy Court Mary F. Walrath said she didn \u2019 t care .\nThe question must be asked , how can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ judge of the premier bankruptcy court of the entire nation \u2013 say she doesn \u2019 t care about lawyers she approved \u2013 betraying their clients trust .\nIt seems that , as long as Colm Connolly ( now appointed a Judge by Trump ) can betray the public \u2019 s trust \u2013 Judge Mary F. Walrath also has no problem betraying the public \u2019 s trust .\nAnother key fact to note is when Laser filed a Complaint against Traub , in the Kay Bee case , Colm Connolly had Laser \u2019 s @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just goes to show you that , in the Trump administration , journalists like Julian Assange and whistleblowers like Laser Haas and Chelsea Manning are punished \u2013 and crooks are rewarded \u2013 even pardoned !\nWe also could also ask the federal prosecutors threatened to keep their mouths shut when the Public Corruption Task Force was shut down \u2013 how they feel about white-collar crime not hurting anyone ?\nIronically , Laser Haas has testified he was raised by crooked parents , to be a crook ; and Laser was even sent to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is crazy that a guy trying to do the right thing is a felon who turned down and reported a million-dollar bribe and a chance to join Romney \u2019 s gang .\nBesides the fact that Mattel is partners with Bain Capital in destroying Kay Bee , Zainy Brainy , FAO Schwarz , Gymboree , Toys R Us and eToys , where 50,000 people lost their careers ; there is the even more serious issue that Colm Connolly and Judge Walraths betrayal of the public \u2019 s trust has resulted in all this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Wheeler , Michael Sesseyoff , Jay Carceiro , Robert Alber , Harry A. , Melissa Lewis , State Trooper=politico , the 2 Madoff sons , Jeffry Picower , John M. and Marty Lackner all tried to assist Laser to get justice .\nBut , we can \u2019 t ask them how they feel about white-collar crime being no big deal ; because all these individuals mentioned who are linked to trying to help expose Bain Capital and Goldman Sachs frauds \u2013 are all DEAD resultant of those who brush off white-collar crimes !\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ Support us at Patreon

immediate effect .\nWhile medical marijuana has become widely accepted across the U.S. , the federal government still claims it is illegal .\nAs we \u2019 ve seen with immigration sanctuary cities , when state and local enforcement ends , the federal government has an extremely difficult time enforcing their acts .\nUnder the Controlled Substances Act ( CSA ) passed in 1970 , the federal government maintains complete prohibition of marijuana .\nOf course , the federal government lacks any constitutional authority to ban or regulate marijuana within the borders @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the politically connected lawyers on the Supreme Court .\nIf you doubt this , ask yourself why it took a constitutional amendment to institute federal alcohol prohibition .\nUtah \u2019 s medical marijuana program removes a layer of laws prohibiting the possession and use of marijuana , and the passage of SB121 expands that , but federal prohibition remains in place .\nFBI statistics show that law enforcement makes approximately 99 of 100 marijuana arrests under state , not federal law .\nBy curtailing state prohibition , Oklahoma sweeps part of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nFurthermore , figures

\u2019 t include the cost of prosecution either .\nThe lesson ?\nThe feds lack the resources to enforce marijuana prohibition without state assistance .\nUtah joins a growing number of states simply ignoring federal prohibition , and nullifying it in practice .\nColorado , Washington state , Oregon and Alaska were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and California , Nevada , Maine and Massachusetts joined them after ballot initiatives in favor of legalization passed in November 2016 .\nMichigan followed suit when voters legalized cannabis for general use in 2018 .\nVermont became the first state to legalize marijuana through a legislative act in 2018 .\nIllinois followed suit in 2019 .\nWith 33 states including allowing cannabis for medical use , the feds find themselves in a position where they simply can \u2019 t enforce prohibition anymore .\n\u201c The lesson here is pretty straightforward .\nWhen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u2019 to the federal government , and enough states pass laws backing those people up , there \u2019 s not much the feds can do to shove their so-called laws , regulations or mandates down our throats , \u201d Tenth Amendment Center founder and executive director Michael Boldin said .\nThe passage of SB121 demonstrates another important strategic reality .\nOnce a legalizes marijuana \u2013 even if only in a very limited way \u2013 it tends to eventually expand .\nAs the state tears down some barriers , markets develop and demand expands @ @ @ @ @ @ @ state law .\nThese new laws represent a further erosion of unconstitutional federal marijuana prohibition .\nMichael

Bush told a crowd of cheering supporters , \u201c they misunderestimated me.\n\u201d Now , if English is not your native language , allow me to clear the air : \u2018 misunderestimate \u2019 is not a word .\nBut then again , George W. Bush was legendary for hilarious slip-ups like this .\nThere are entire books dedicated to his \u2018 Bushisms , \u2019 the ridiculous made-up words and incomprehensible sayings that became routine for the 43rd US President .\n\u2018 Misunderestimate \u2019 seems to be a conflation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u2018 underestimate \u2019 .\nAnd while that was utterly hysterical 20 years ago when Bush first said it , \u2018 misunderestimate \u2019 may be the most appropriate word of today .\nThe entire world has completely \u2018 misunderestimated \u2019 the Coronavirus .\nIn terms of misunderstand \u2013 that \u2019 s obvious .\nThere \u2019 s so much that we don \u2019 t know about the virus ( officially known as SARS-CoV-2 ) and the disease that it causes ( COVID-19 ) .\nFor example , a group of researchers published a \u201c peer-reviewed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the virus had split into multiple strains .\nBut other specialists in the field strongly disagreed with the paper \u2019 s conclusions .\nSwiss biologist Richard Neher described the research as , \u201c wrong , misleading .\n.\n.\ndownright dangerous inferences , \u201d while Australian virologist Ian Mackay called it a \u201c weak paper and poor science.\n\u201d Another peer-reviewed study released in the Journal of Medical Virology concluded that the virus originated from snakes .\nBut plenty of experts disagreed with that assertion too .\nThe scientific community has learned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ surfaced a few months ago .\nBut there \u2019 s still so much that \u2019 s unknown\u2013 and that makes perfect sense given that this virus is brand new .\nThey \u2019 re trying to figure it out as quickly as possible , but that \u2019 s naturally going to lead to some disagreements and conflicting conclusions .\nBut then the Internet takes over , and suddenly everyone \u2019 s an expert .\nPeople who have no background in medicine and biology Tweet with a level of certainty about the virus that \u2019 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ personality Jimmy Kimmel joked about this last week , saying , \u201c I speak [ about the virus ] as if I \u2019 ve been a professor of immunology at Stanford for 35 years\u2026 \u201d There \u2019 s still so many things that the experts don \u2019 t understand , or don \u2019 t agree on .\nThe answers are coming , but it \u2019 s still early days .\nBut in addition to misunderstanding , the world has also totally underestimated this virus\u2026 and continues to do so .\nIt started in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ government trying to keep the outbreak quiet and taking steps to silence the first whistleblower .\nAs the virus began to spread , Western nations complacently shrugged it off and assumed it would remain in Asia .\nEven the World Health Organization refused to call this a \u2018 pandemic \u2019 until March 11\u2026 only a week ago .\nInvestors around the world ignored this for months , completely underestimating the massive , worldwide economic impact the virus would have .\nEven now , after one of the worst stock market crashes in history @ @ @ @ @ @ @ effects .\nAnd I \u2019 m not talking about the stock market ( though there could easily be more losses ahead ) .\nI \u2019 m talking about something far more serious : banks .\nBanks are about to drown in an ocean of defaults .\nI \u2019 ll talk about this a lot more in the coming days , but briefly : \u2022 There \u2019 s $ 250 TRILLION in global debt right now\u2013 mortgages , credit card debt , business loans , government debt , etc .\n\u2022 And banks own @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u2022 This virus crisis is going to trigger a wave of defaults from consumers , businesses , and even governments .\n\u2022 Think about it : tourism alone makes up 10 % of global GDP .\nRevenue in that entire sector\u2013 hotels , airlines , cruise ships , etc .\nhas collapsed , and many of those companies aren \u2019 t going to survive .\n\u2022 The crash in oil prices is going to wipe out countless oil companies .\n\u2022 Many large retail chains , which were already struggling in the age @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\n\u2022 Countless businesses around the world have \u2018 temporarily \u2019 closed due to public health policies , and many of them will go out of business entirely .\n\u2022 MOST of these businesses owe lots of money to the banks , whether it \u2019 s a small business working line , or the $ 34 billion in debt that American Airlines owes .\nSo the defaults are going to be massive .\n\u2022 On top of that , millions of people are going to lose their jobs and be unable to make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ auto loans , and even mortgages .\n\u2022 Again , there \u2019 s $ 250 trillion in global debt right now .\nTotal bank capital worldwide is less than $ 10 trillion .\n\u2022 So if the coming defaults trigger a mere 4 % loss in total debt , it will exceed the entirety of global bank capital .\n\u2022 And this doesn \u2019 t even take into consideration the impact of the $ 1 QUADRILLION derivatives exposure .\nThis looming wave of loan defaults over the next few months could spark a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ completely dwarfs what happened back in 2008 .\nI desperately want to be wrong .\nAnd it \u2019 s possible that public health officials radically shift their positions in the coming weeks and tell all the young , healthy people in the world to go back to work , get infected , and start developing immunity .\nThey may be forced to do this to avoid destroying the global economy .\nBut at this point , every possible scenario is on the table .\nNothing is out of the question\u2026 especially when the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to misunderestimate the effects of this virus could be far more dangerous than the virus itself .\nWe \u2019 ll talk about this more in the coming days , along with some sensible suggestions

\u2014 not talking about the mainstream @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or things will get really bad : as in millions dead in America alone .\nMake no mistake , things will get much worse before they start to get better .\nBut it is not all doom and gloom .\nThere are things you can do in your local community and around the world to help those affected by these dark times .\nHelp those affected by the recent closures Monday marked a day in this country which has never happened .\nFrom coast to coast millions of workers simultaneously found out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ next day .\nThe impact was so large that it overwhelmed unemployment websites , causing them to crash .\nThe coronavirus measures could impact these people in extreme ways and for months to come .\nSome dine-in restaurants are allowed to stay

Internet: A Dangerous Zombie CFAA Expansion Bill is Back", "content": "A group of senators in Washington is trying\u2014for the fourth time\u2014to pass dangerous and misguided language that would amend and expand the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act ( CFAA ) , our nation \u2019 s notoriously vague anti-hacking law .\nThe language was first floated in 2015 , then again in 2016 , and again in 2018 .\nBack in 2018 , the language made up a standalone bill , the International Cybercrime Prevention Act , and the Senators have dropped that entire bill into Title IV of the Defending American Security from Kremlin Aggression Act .\nTitle IV is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ botnets , but its provisions would have implications far beyond that limited context .\nWhat it actually does is unnecessarily expand the CFAA without fixing any of the law \u2019 s existing problems .\nThe CFAA already threatens beneficial security research , and Title IV , which increases penalties , will only make that threat worse .\nIt also creates broad new authority for the government to obtain court orders to stop violations of the CFAA , or to order third parties to do so on its behalf .\nThis could result in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fails to provide any protections or give users any recourse if their systems are harmed .\nSenators Whitehouse , Graham , and Blumenthal have included this language as one small section in a hundred-page bill that would do a variety of other things unrelated to botnets , like create a federal department to serve as the lead policy body on issues related to international cybersecurity and Internet freedom , and amend the criminal code to target election interference .\nThis was a bad idea when it was first introduced in 2015 , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ today\u2014no matter what packaging the senators try to put it into .\nBack in 2015 , when we opposed the original incarnation of this language , Senator Sheldon Whitehouse accused EFF and other civil liberties organizations as being part of a \u201c hidden pro-botnet , pro-foreign cyber criminal caucus.\n\u201d That was a ridiculous claim .\nWe are simply well aware of how the CFAA has been abused .\nThe CFAA is already the \u201c worst law in technology , \u201d and this bill would only make it worse , by making it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ malicious cybercrime is a noble goal , but we should do so via well-crafted and narrowly-targeted legislation\u2014not via a bill that will threaten beneficial cybersecurity research .\nUnnecessary Expansion of the CFAA Without Fixing Any of the Law \u2019 s Existing Problems This language would expand the existing prohibition in the CFAA against selling passwords to selling any \u201c means of access.\n\u201d Such an expansion is unnecessary and misguided .\nThe government has claimed that this change is necessary to enable prosecution of those selling or renting botnets to malicious actors , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to commit a violation of the CFAA .\nAnd the CFAA \u2019 s prohibitions on unauthorized access already criminalize the creation and use of malicious botnets .\nWhat \u2019 s more , the proposed broad language\u2014 \u201c means of access \u201d \u2014is in no way limited to the sale or rental of malicious botnets .\nThe bill fails to define \u201c means of access , \u201d and with no guidance , it is unclear how broadly prosecutors or courts will apply this provision .\nThe provision could make criminals of paid researchers who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disclose , and fix vulnerabilities .\nThis language would also create a broad new criminal violation and harsh penalties for damaging \u201c critical infrastructure \u201d computers .\nThe scope of critical infrastructure has been broadly interpreted by the Department of Homeland Security , which means these harsh penalties could have far-reaching implications\u2014including for the security research community .\nAnd because hacking computers is already illegal under the CFAA , this amendment\u2014and its corresponding threat to beneficial security research\u2014is wholly unnecessary .\nNew Authority for the Government to Obtain Civil Injunctions to Stop Violations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Avoid Collateral Damage This language would also amend 18 U.S.C .\n\u00a7 1345 to give the government new authority to obtain civil injunctions to force companies to stop service , redirect domain names , or take any other actions deemed necessary to stop violations of the CFAA .\nThough the provision is ostensibly directed at stopping botnets , it could apply to a range of unrelated activities\u2014such as activists who send faxes en masse to hundreds of members of Congress at once .\nSignificantly , this language fails to require that the government @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get caught up in such takeovers , such as botnet victims , or even people who simply use the same services as botnet operators .\nMillions of Internet users witnessed the damage such lack of notice can cause back in 2014 , when Microsoft \u2019 s attempt to stop an 18,000-node botnet resulted in termination of Domain Name Service ( DNS ) to nearly 5,000,000 innocent subdomains\u2014all because Microsoft got an ex parte court order that blocked notice to the DNS provider , No-IP.com .\nHad the DNS provider received notice , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shutting off service for millions of innocent subdomains that were not a part of the botnet .\nThis language also provides innocent users no recourse if their systems are harmed , and allows companies that assist the government a free pass for any damage caused .\nWhat We Really Need : Reform that Reins in the CFAA and Protects Security Researchers EFF will oppose the senators \u2019 misguided proposal\u2014just like we did the last three times this zombie bill was proposed .\nWhatever they call it , and whatever else they try to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ need is reform that reins in the CFAA , not a measure that makes things worse .\nThe proposed changes increase penalties , expand the state \u2019 s scope , and threaten the security community\u2014all while failing to address ambiguity in existing law that has chilled security research , resulted in disproportionate penalties , and criminalized ordinary Internet activity .\nIn a world where everyone relies on the Internet for their personal and professional lives , Congress should be doing all it can to encourage good faith security research , which

course , bailouts for the rich .\nState and local governments then quickly followed suit and began to shut down restaurants , bars , gyms , churches , and other areas in which larger groups gather .\nPrimary elections are being suspended , millions of people are locked down , and curfews and police state actions are getting closer on the horizon .\nSocial distancing is undoubtedly the best way to stop the spread of this disease and most experts \u2014 not talking about the mainstream @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or things will get really bad : as in millions dead in America alone .\nMake no mistake , things will get much worse before they start to get better .\nBut it is not all doom and gloom .\nThere are things you can do in your local community and around the world to help those affected by these dark times .\nHelp those affected by the recent closures Monday marked a day in this country which has never happened .\nFrom coast to coast millions of workers simultaneously found out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ next day .\nThe impact was so large that it overwhelmed unemployment websites , causing them to crash .\nThe coronavirus measures could impact these people in extreme ways and for months to come .\nSome dine-in restaurants are allowed to stay open during these times to serve take-out meals .\nIf you are still able to freely travel in your town , you should consider visiting some of these places if you can afford it and tipping well as the $ 2.13 an hour wage is not sustainable .\nIf you know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ helping them out with food or donations or work , if you have it .\nAnother way to help is to buy gift cards to your favorite local restaurants , stores , from your hair stylist and local spa .\nThe business will get the money today , but you can use it later .\nPay in cash , if possible , to avoid further lag time .\nIf you are one of the folks affected by these closures , check your state \u2019 s guidelines as some of them are already rolling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it is estimated that roughly 40 percent of the medical workforce is affected by the closure of schools .\nIf you can watch a healthcare worker \u2019 s child so they can get back to helping countless other sick people , this effort will prove to make a massive difference .\nRun errands for those who can not leave their homes As the virus continues to spread , there will be more and more people who are quarantined in their homes .\nThe panic from self-quarantine has already caused runs on grocery @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of toilet paper .\nMany of these folks who are now quarantined may not have had time to get supplies before they were unable to leave their homes .\nYou can help them .\nKelly Arsenault , in Knoxville , TN is providing an inspiring example of how this can look in your community .\nShe started a \u201c Kindness Committee \u201d to help those who can not leave their homes .\nIf your neighborhood doesn \u2019 t have one , it is as simple as creating a form on Google .\nArsenault @ @ @

supply .\nAs more people contract the virus , fewer people will be eligible to donate blood .\nThe organization asks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pandemic , and emphasizes that there is no evidence that COVID-19 can

advantage of a crisis , legitimate or manufactured .\nThis coronavirus pandemic is no exception .\nNot only are the federal and state governments unraveling the constitutional fabric of the nation with lockdown mandates that are sending the economy into a tailspin and wreaking havoc with our liberties , but they are also rendering the citizenry fully dependent on the government for financial handouts , medical intervention , protection and sustenance .\nUnless we find some way to rein in the government \u2019 s power grabs , the fallout will be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for years\u2014government overreach , invasive surveillance , martial law , abuse of powers , militarized police , weaponized technology used to track and control the citizenry , and so on\u2014has coalesced into this present moment .\nThe government \u2019 s shameless exploitation of past national emergencies for its own nefarious purposes pales in comparison to what is presently unfolding .\nDeploying the same strategy it used with 9/11 to acquire greater powers under the USA Patriot Act , the police state\u2014a.k.a .\nthe shadow government , a.k.a .\nthe Deep State\u2014has been anticipating @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a wish list of lockdown powers that could be trotted out and approved at a moment \u2019 s notice .\nIt should surprise no one , then , that the Trump Administration has asked Congress to allow it to suspend parts of the Constitution whenever it deems it necessary during this coronavirus pandemic and \u201c other \u201d emergencies .\nIt \u2019 s that \u201c other \u201d emergencies part that should particularly give you pause , if not spur you to immediate action ( by action , I mean a loud and vocal , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ apolitical , nonpartisan resistance ) .\nIn fact , the Department of Justice ( DOJ ) has been quietly trotting out and testing a long laundry list of terrifying powers that override the Constitution .\nWe \u2019 re talking about lockdown powers ( at both the federal and state level ) : the ability to suspend the Constitution , indefinitely detain American citizens , bypass the courts , quarantine whole communities or segments of the population , override the First Amendment by outlawing religious gatherings and assemblies of more than a few people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the economy , muzzle dissidents , \u201c stop and seize any plane , train or automobile to stymie the spread of contagious disease , \u201d reshape financial markets , create a digital currency ( and thus further restrict the use of cash ) , determine who should live or die\u2026 You \u2019 re getting the picture now , right ?\nThese are powers the police state would desperately like to make permanent .\nSpecifically , the DOJ wants to be able to indefinitely detain American citizens without trial .\nThe DOJ also wants @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and suspend the statute of limitations on criminal and civil cases .\nBoth signify a clear violation of every right espoused in the Constitution , including habeas corpus .\nHabeas corpus , a fundamental tenet of English common law that guards against arbitrary and lawless state action , does not appear anywhere in the Bill of Rights .\nIts importance was such that it was enshrined in the Constitution itself .\nAnd it is of such magnitude that all other rights , including those in the Bill of Rights , are dependent upon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ significance of all other rights crumbles .\nThe right of habeas corpus was important to the Framers of the Constitution because they knew from personal experience what it was like to be labeled enemy combatants , imprisoned indefinitely and not given the opportunity to appear before a neutral judge .\nBelieving that such arbitrary imprisonment is \u201c in all ages , the favorite and most formidable instrument of tyranny , \u201d the Founders were all the more determined to protect Americans from such government abuses .\nTranslated as \u201c you should have the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ legal action , or writ , by which those imprisoned unlawfully can seek relief from their imprisonment .\nDerived from English common law , habeas corpus first appeared in the Magna Carta of 1215 and is the oldest human right in the history of English-speaking civilization .\nThe doctrine of habeas corpus stems from the requirement that a government must either charge a person or let him go free .\nWhile serving as President , Thomas Jefferson addressed the essential necessity of habeas corpus .\nIn his first inaugural address on March 4 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I know , indeed , that some honest men fear that a republican government can not be strong ; that this government is not strong enough.\n\u201d But , said Jefferson , our nation was \u201c the world \u2019 s best hope \u201d and , because of our strong commitment to democracy , \u201c the strongest government on earth.\n\u201d Jefferson said that the sum of this basic belief was found in the \u201c freedom of person under the protection of the habeas corpus ; and trial by juries impartially selected .\nThese @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gone before us , and guided our steps through an age of revolution and reformation.\n\u201d Throughout the twentieth century , the importance of the right of habeas corpus has repeatedly been confirmed by the U.S. Supreme Court .\nYet 200-plus years after America \u2019 s founders risked their lives to secure their freedoms , we find ourselves right back where we started , with a government determined to strip us of every vestige of our freedoms .\nThe DOJ \u2019 s latest request to Congress is merely a signal that the police @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the shadows , with the current national emergency being a convenient cover for their dastardly deeds .\nBear in mind , however , that these powers the Trump Administration , acting on orders from the police state , are officially asking Congress to recognize and authorize barely scratch the surface of the far-reaching powers the government has already unilaterally claimed for itself .\nUnofficially , the police state has been riding roughshod over the rule of law for years now without any pretense of being reined in or restricted in its power grabs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ citizenry .\nAs David C. Unger , observes in The Emergency State : America \u2019 s Pursuit of Absolute Security at All Costs : This rise of an \u201c emergency state \u201d that justifies all manner of government tyranny in the so-called name of national security is all happening according to schedule .\nThe civil unrest , the national emergencies , \u201c unforeseen economic collapse , loss of functioning political and legal order , purposeful domestic resistance or insurgency , pervasive public health emergencies , and catastrophic natural and human disasters , \u201d @ @ @ @ @ @ @ armed forces to solve domestic political and social problems , the implicit declaration of martial law packaged as a well-meaning and overriding concern for the nation \u2019 s security : the powers-that-be have been planning and preparing for such a crisis for years now , not just with active shooter drills and lockdowns and checkpoints and heightened danger alerts , but with a sensory overload of militarized , battlefield images\u2014in video games , in movies , on the news\u2014that acclimate us to life in a police state .\nWhether or not this particular @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own making is not the point : to those for whom power and profit are everything , the end always justifies the means .\nThe seeds of this present madness were sown several decades ago when George W. Bush stealthily issued two presidential directives that granted the president the power to unilaterally declare a national emergency , which is loosely defined as \u201c any incident , regardless of location , that results in extraordinary levels of mass casualties , damage , or disruption severely affecting the U.S. population , infrastructure , environment , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the country \u2019 s Continuity of Government ( COG ) plan , these directives ( National Security Presidential Directive 51 and Homeland Security Presidential Directive 20 ) , which do not need congressional approval , provide a skeletal outline of the actions the president will take in the event of a \u201c national emergency.\n\u201d Mind you , that national emergency can take any form , can be manipulated for any purpose and can be used to justify any end goal\u2014all on the say so of the president .\nJust what sort of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ declares a national emergency can barely be discerned from the barebones directives .\nHowever , one thing is clear : in the event of a national emergency , the president will become a dictator because while the COG directives ensure the continuity of executive branch functions , they do not provide for repopulating or reconvening Congress or the Supreme Court .\nThus , a debilitating attack would give unchecked executive , legislative and judicial power to the executive branch and its unelected minions .\nThe country would then be subjected to martial law @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Bill of Rights would be suspended .\nOriginally devised as a plan for quickly restoring constitutional government , the COG concept arose during the Cold War .\nThe fear was that a nuclear strike would paralyze the federal government .\nThese concerns continued into the 1980s .\nUnder President Ronald Reagan , an elaborate plan was created in which three teams consisting of a cabinet member , an executive chief of staff and military and intelligence officials would practice evacuating and directing a counter nuclear strike against the Soviet Union from a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nIf the president and vice president were both killed , one of these teams would take control , with the ranking cabinet official serving as president .\nAmong those Reagan handpicked to advise an inexperienced and potentially incompetent successor in a time of crisis were Congressman Dick Cheney and Donald Rumsfeld , then a business executive with G. D. Searle & Co. At least once a year during the 1980s , Cheney and Rumsfeld vanished on top-secret training missions , where each of the teams practiced evacuating and directing a counter nuclear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after the attacks of September 11 , 2001 , when it became clear that the assumptions that drove COG planning during the Cold War no longer applied : there would be no warning against a so-called \u201c terrorist \u201d attack .\nThus , instead of relying on part-time bureaucrats and evacuation schematics , the Bush administration permanently appointed executive officials , stationed outside the capital , to run a shadow government .\nThe U.S. military has reportedly already been given standby orders under COG for this present coronavirus pandemic .\nThe plans for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ run the Deep State are more elaborate than many realize .\nMassive underground bunkers the size of small cities are sprinkled throughout the country for the government elite to escape to in the event of a national emergency .\nMount Weather , near Bluemont , Va. , is one of a number of such facilities .\nBuilt into the side of a mountain , this bunker contains , among other things , a hospital , crematorium , dining and recreation areas , sleeping quarters , reservoirs of drinking and cooling water , an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nThere is also an Office of the Presidency at Mount Weather , which regularly receives top-secret national security information from all the federal departments and agencies .\nThis facility was largely unknown to everyone , including Congress , until it came to light in the mid-1970s .\nMilitary personnel connected to the bunker have refused to reveal any information about it , even before congressional committees .\nIn fact , Congress has no oversight , budgetary or otherwise , on Mount Weather , and the specifics of the facility remain top-secret .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ We are , for all intents and purposes , one crisis away from having a full-fledged authoritarian state emerge from the shadows , at which time democratic government will be dissolved and the country will be ruled by an unelected bureaucracy .\nThis is exactly the kind of mischief that Thomas Jefferson warned against when he cautioned , \u201c In questions of power , then , let no more be heard of confidence in man , but bind him down from mischief by the chains of the Constitution.\n\u201d Thus far , we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ abides by the Constitution .\nThose who wrote our Constitution sought to ensure our freedoms by creating a document that protects our God-given rights at all times , even when we are engaged in war , whether that is a so-called war on terrorism , a so-called war on drugs , a so-called war on illegal immigration , or a so-called war on disease .\nThe attempts by each successive presidential administration to rule by fiat merely plays into the hands of those who would distort the government \u2019 s system of checks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ powers beyond all recognition .\nRemember , these powers do not expire at the end of a president \u2019 s term .\nThey remain on the books , just waiting to be used or abused by the next political demagogue .\nSo , too , every action taken by Trump and his predecessors to weaken the system of checks and balances , sidestep the rule of law , and expand the power of the executive branch of government has made us that much more vulnerable to those who would abuse those powers in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the President with very specific , limited powers , in recent years , American presidents ( Trump , Obama , Bush , Clinton , etc . )\nhave claimed the power to completely and almost unilaterally alter the landscape of this country for good or for ill .\nThe Trump Administration \u2019 s willingness to circumvent the Constitution by leaning heavily on the president \u2019 s so-called emergency powers constitutes a gross perversion of what limited power the Constitution affords the executive branch .\nThe powers amassed by each successive president through the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ add up to a toolbox of terror for an imperial ruler\u2014empower whomever occupies the Oval Office to act as a dictator , above the law and beyond any real accountability .\nAs law professor William P. Marshall explains , \u201c every extraordinary use of power by one President expands the availability of executive branch power for use by future Presidents.\n\u201d Moreover , it doesn \u2019 t even matter whether other presidents have chosen not to take advantage of any particular power , because \u201c it is a President \u2019 s action in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ use , that has the precedential significance.\n\u201d In other words , each successive president continues to add to his office \u2019 s list of extraordinary orders and directives , expanding the reach and power of the presidency and granting him- or herself near dictatorial powers .\nThis abuse of presidential powers has been going on for so long that it has become the norm , the Constitution be damned .\nWe no longer have a system of checks and balances .\n\u201c The system of checks and balances that the Framers envisioned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ longer in balance , \u201d concludes Marshall .\n\u201c The implications of this are serious .\nThe Framers designed a system of separation of powers to combat government excess and abuse and to curb incompetence .\nThey also believed that , in the absence of an effective separation-of-powers structure , such ills would inevitably follow .\nUnfortunately , however , power once taken is not easily surrendered.\n\u201d All of the imperial powers amassed by Barack Obama and George W. Bush and now Trump\u2014to kill American citizens without due process , to detain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , to strip Americans of their citizenship rights , to carry out mass surveillance on Americans without probable cause , to wage wars without congressional authorization , to suspend laws during wartime , to disregard laws with which he might disagree , to conduct secret wars and convene secret courts , to sanction torture , to sidestep the legislatures and courts with executive orders and signing statements , to direct the military to operate beyond the reach of the law , to establish a standing army on American soil , to operate a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for any manipulated reason , and to act as a dictator and a tyrant , above the law and beyond any real accountability\u2014have become a permanent part of the president \u2019 s toolbox of terror .\nThese presidential powers\u2014acquired through the use of executive orders , decrees , memorandums , proclamations , national security directives and legislative signing statements and which can be activated by any sitting president\u2014enable past , president and future presidents to operate above the law and beyond the reach of the Constitution .\nThink on this : the presidential @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Suddenly , the improbable possibility of any incumbent president attempting to extend the police state \u2019 s stranglehold on power by using current events to justify postponing or doing away with an election\u2014forfeiting the people \u2019 s rights to govern altogether\u2014and establishing a totalitarian regime seems less far-fetched than it did even a few years ago .\nThe emergency state is now out in the open for all to see .\nUnfortunately , \u201c we the people \u201d refuse to see what \u2019 s before us .\nMost Americans , fearful and easily @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fight for that last roll of toilet paper than they would their own freedoms .\nThis is how freedom dies .\nWe erect our own prison walls , and as our rights dwindle away , we forge our own chains of servitude to the police state .\nBe warned , however : once you surrender your freedoms to the government\u2014no matter how compelling the reason might be for doing so\u2014you can never get them back .\nAs I make clear in my book Battlefield America : The War on the American People , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we continue down this road , there can be no surprise about what awaits us at the end .\nThe America metamorphosing before our eyes is almost unrecognizable from the country I grew up in , and that \u2019 s not just tragic\u2014it \u2019 s downright terrifying .\nConstitutional attorney and author John W.

"title": "Media Watch: Groundbreaking UN Torture Report Shunned by Mainstream", "content": "The United Nations Special Rapporteur on Torture , Nils Melzer , has issued a report which gives official acknowledgement\u2014possibly for the first time\u2014to aspects of a torture program that has been launched covertly in the US and elsewhere .\nBut you wouldn \u2019 t know it if you read mainstream media .\nThere has been not a word concerning Melzer \u2019 s report in the Associated Press , Reuters , the NY Times , the Washington Post , ad nauseum .\nThe report , entitled \u201c Torture and other cruel , inhuman and degrading treatment , \u201d deals primarily with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and psychological torture .\nIn so doing , the report devotes a section to what Melzer is calling \u201c cyber torture.\n\u201d Melzer writes : In a nod to the multiplicity of reports that the SR recently received claiming gang stalking and electronic torture , the report goes on to state that \u201c cybertechnologies can also be used \u2026through intimidation , harassment , surveillance , public shaming and defamation.\n\u201d The report also expresses concern that cybertechnology may be employed to torture through \u2026.\n\u201d medical implants , and , conceivably nano- or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could locate only two established news outlets which even covered the SR \u2019 s report , The Guardian and Al Jazeera .\nAt the time of this writing , the large human rights NGOs , which generally include addressing torture as part of their mandate \u2014 Amnesty International , Human Rights Watch , Human Rights First , Physicians for Human Rights , Center for Victims of Torture \u2014 have not given any acknowledgment to the SR \u2019 s report on their websites or in press releases .\nNor did they respond to requests @ @ @ @ @ @ @ use of electronic and internet-based devices for the purposes of harassment and worse of ordinary citizens has exploded in the last decade or so .\nWhile a few local TV networks have ventured into new territory by running some segments on this phenomenon , this has largely been seen as the dominion of \u201c tin foil hats.\n\u201d A couple examples of rare TV coverage follow : When the NY Times covered this issue , they were savage , however .\nThe fact that Melzer \u2019 s report seems to have fallen into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ questions as to the alliances made by media and NGOs .\nFor example , it is known that the US State Department contributes heavily to some human rights organizations , as do other allied governments .\nOne wonders if their silence has been bought or if there are more complicated political scenarios at play .\nAs the report delineates , States , corporate actors and organized criminals are listed as those who have the capacity to use cybertechnology to torture .\nIn other words , powerful interests have aligned themselves with the development @ @ @ @ @ @ @ military .\nThere is a close relationship between torture and human experimentation .\nWhen the Church Committee uncovered details implicating the CIA in using citizens as unwitting guinea pigs in pursuit of creating the \u201c perfect spy , \u201d the agency destroyed their files and the programs continued on , quietly .\nA recent lawsuit , Edgewood Test Vets , reveals a US government disinterested in the welfare of those soldiers put into these chemical and biological human experimentation programs .\nAfter decades of neglect , the Army finally agreed to provide medical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nMore recently , allegations have surfaced that UCLA Neuropsychiatric Hospital was running a human experimentation program in an inpatient unit , A-South .\nThe program , which was certainly active in the late nineties , appeared to focus on studies of brain electricity and is alleged to have nonconsensually shocked mental patients , as well as giving providing \u201c pharmaceuticals \u201d which resulted in seizure activity .\nUCLA has brazenly violated the California Public Records Act in failing to respond to requests for routine information about the unit , such as a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ building plans for the unit , which was reportedly demolished circa 2006 .\nIn her change.org petition , Dr. Millicent Black elucidates the connection between human experimentation and electronic weapons .\nBlack met with Juan Mendez , the former SR on Torture concerning this issue and writes that Dr. Black is a pastor and was also part of Techno Crime Fighters , a weekly broadcast which aired on YouTube for the targeted community .\nIn 2007 , an ACLU attorney in Oregon told me that the \u201c climate wasn \u2019 t right \u201d @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attorney stated this after documents were leaked to me indicating that the Medford Police Department was taking no action on citizen Internal Affairs complaints , while stating to the complainants that the officers in question had been disciplined .\nIf one expands the definition of police abuse to include systematic abuse of citizens with covert weaponry by government and corporate actors , one may conclude that by tackling these concerns in his report , Dr. Melzer has done a brave and remarkable thing .\nAt this juncture , surveillance abuse ( which is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) is getting headlines , as the US Senate readies itself to vote on reauthorizing sections of the PATRIOT Act which allow rampant spying on US citizens .\nAlso making headlines is a lawsuit by CAIR , a Muslim Civil Rights organization , questioning the constitutionality of the \u201c Terrorist Watchlist , \u201d a list which clearly now includes non-Muslim journalists and activists and may have connections to a cyber torture program .\nParenthetically , the court sided with CAIR .\nThe Department of Justice is appealing the decision .\nA confluence of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ perils of the surveillance state .\nOne might only hope that Big Media and Big Human Rights could drop their defensive guard and help to shine a

Now What?", "content": "On March 15 , 2020 , Section 215 of the PATRIOT Act\u2014a surveillance law with a rich history of government overreach and abuse\u2014expired .\nAlong with two other PATRIOT Act provisions , Section 215 lapsed after lawmakers failed to reach an agreement on a broader set of reforms to the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act ( FISA ) .\nIn the week before the law expired , the House of Representatives passed the USA FREEDOM Reauthorization Act , without committee markup or floor amendments , which would have extended Section 215 for three more years , along with some modest reforms @ @ @ @ @ @ @ become law , the House and Senate must pass an identical bill , and the President must sign it .\nThat didn \u2019 t happen with the USA FREEDOM Reauthorization Act .\nInstead , knowing the vote to proceed with the House \u2019 s bill in the Senate without debating amendments was going to fail , Senator McConnell brought a bill to the floor that would extend all the expiring provisions for another 77 days , without any reforms at all .\nSenator McConnell \u2019 s extension passed the Senate without debate .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ without passing Senator McConnell \u2019 s bill , at least until May 12 , 2020 , and possibly longer .\nThat means that Section 215 of the USA PATRIOT Act , along with the so-called lone wolf and the roving wiretap provisions have expired , at least for a few weeks .\nSo Now What ?\nEFF has argued that if Congress can \u2019 t agree on real reforms to these problematic laws , they should be allowed to expire .\nWhile we are pleased that Congress didn \u2019 t mechanically reauthorize Section @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a number of largely overlapping surveillance authorities .\nThe loss of the current version of the law will still leave the government with a range of tools that is still incredibly powerful .\nThese include other provisions of FISA as well as surveillance authorities used in criminal investigations , many of which can include gag orders to protect sensitive information .\nIn addition , the New York Times and others have noted that Section 215 \u2019 s expiration clause contains an exception permitting the intelligence community to use the law for investigations that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or to investigate \u201c offenses or potential offenses \u201d that occurred before the sunset .\nBroad reliance on this exception would subvert Congress \u2019 s intent to have Section 215 truly expire , and the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court should carefully\u2014and publicly\u2014circumscribe any attempt to rely on it .\nAlthough Section 215 and the two other provisions have expired , that doesn \u2019 t mean they \u2019 re gone forever .\nFor example , in 2015 , during the debate over the USA FREEDOM Act , these same provisions were also allowed to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and then Congress reauthorized them for another four years .\nWhile transparency is still lacking in how these programs operate , the intelligence community did not report a disruption in any of these \u201c critical \u201d programs at that time .\nIf Congress chooses to reauthorize these programs in the next couple of months , it \u2019 s unlikely that this disruption will have a lasting impact .\nThe Senate plans to vote on a series of amendments to the House-passed USA FREEDOM Reauthorization Act in the near future .\nAny changes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be approved by the House and signed by the President .\nThis means that Congress has the opportunity to discuss whether these authorities are actually needed , without the pressure of a ticking clock .\nAs a result , the House and the Senate should take this unique opportunity to learn more about these provisions and create additional oversight into the surveillance programs that rely on them .\nThe expired provisions should remain expired until Congress enacts the additional , meaningful reforms we \u2019 ve been seeking .\nYou can read more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it

to have you offer up some thoughts for my readers here at Strategic Living .\nYeah , Gaye , I think we \u2019 re ALL disgusted with what passes for \u201c news \u201d these days .\nAt least if your IQ is triple digits .\nI just completed a 6,500-word report for my Peoplenomics.com subscribers where I went deep into the historical roots of the problem because most people don \u2019 t see what we \u2019 re experiencing as a long-term \u201c structural consequence \u201d of technological development .\nAs I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , serfs didn \u2019 t worry about the \u201c news cycle.\n\u201d Some bully with a whip would come along and say \u201c Do this , or else\u2026 \u201d and you did it .\nOr else\u2026 What we \u2019 ve turned into a 200-channel wasteland is largely not useful , distracts from our pure purposes in Life , and it \u2019 s a waste of mental processing ( and storage ) capacity .\nWhen someone asks at the water cooler \u201c Hey , what did you think about thus & so\u2026 \u201d people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , being sheep-like , will want to seem \u201c In the Know \u201d and therefore to get ready for water cooler talk , they load up on minutia masquerading as \u201c real news.\n\u201d A few people will look at their questioner and tell them \u201c Who cares ?\nThis ( xyz ) you speak of doesn \u2019 t impact my life in the least .\nHow does it impact yours ?\nNo one expects that and it \u2019 s hard to answer .\nPeople aren \u2019 t really strong these days and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dangerous .\nThe news media has been part of this conditioning , shaming , whining , and dumbing down .\nHow is news reporting supposed to work ?\nPut another way , how do journalists come up with news stories and what steps are taken to ensure that news reporting is accurate ?\nOK\u2026so over time , as our information technology evolved , so did our mental space for contextualizing news .\nThe Big Picture problem is we have moved into a hyper-complex 3D data-centric world .\nYet our thinking is stuck back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nMost people don \u2019 t even know what the inverted pyramid style of writing is , let alone how limiting it can be .\nThe Serfs \u2013 or Neanderthals \u2013 didn \u2019 t need news \u2013 they just needed to do what \u201c the Man \u201d with the whip said .\n1440 A.D. and comes Gutenberg and suddenly everyone is moving into Book Land .\nEven so , it wasn \u2019 t until metal type became common-place that news got its \u201c legs under it.\n\u201d Remember \u2013 although hardly anyone does @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u2019 s first bloggers .\nAs news ( event reports for short time-frames ) arose , it was centered around six key concepts : Who , What , When , Why , Where , and How .\nThe arrangement of these elements in print journalism became the \u201c inverted pyramid style.\n\u201d In fact , however , this was a reduction of news events \u2013 which often have very long time-frames over which they \u2019 ve evolved \u2013 then distilling these down to a 2-dimensional \u2013 usually shallow and biased \u2013 forced-choice .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ Left , and Marxists in university taught gullible journo students that it was OK to be a \u201c champion of the underdog.\n\u201d The forced choicing became unbalanced and left-leaning , anti-establishment all the way to subversive .\nThey wrapped it up all pretty-like , but in truth , that \u2019 s when we crossed the line into propaganda in America .\nThis was when the Lefty \u2019 s railed against Senator Joseph McCarthy in the early 1950s \u2013 when McCarthy was outing thousands in Hollywood as being communist sympathizers and card-carrying subversives @ @ @ @ @ @ @ House UnAmerican Activities Committee \u2013 a lot of what McCarthy had predict has come to pass .\nHe was 85 % right , but the arrogant left implants painted him the fool of history .\nDefenders of the Left \u2013 including a good number of well-intentioned moderates and middle of the roaders \u2013 got sucked into defending the Left and we \u2019 ve never really gotten over this .\nThe dance continues in the New York Timers daily .\nNext came the Corporatization takeover of \u201c news.\n\u201d You were in the Federal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Board around 1970 .\nThat \u2019 s when the PR industry was getting its legs under it .\nThat \u2019 s when \u201c manufacturing of opinion blocks was elevated to a high-paid business model .\nAre there any professional organizations that establish and uphold journalistic standards and if so , are there any checks and balances to ensure those standards are met ?\nWell , there are a few : I \u2019 ve been a past member of the Society [ of ] American Business Editors and Writers ( SABEW ) and I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ National Association of Newspaper Columnists ( https : //columnists.com ) and they are quite welcoming of news media people ( internet-based writers ) .\nNot really hard-hitting and data and quantification techniques , however .\nCome to think of it , most J-schools aren \u2019 t , either .\nIn the main , however , there has been so much advocacy journalism that awards I won when young , like a regional Sigma Delta Chi award , just doesn \u2019 t seem to mean as much these days .\nThe press ( and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interested in opinion and advocacy rather than hardcore \u201c Here \u2019 s the damn data and here are some expert projections of where this leads us.\n\u201d It \u2019 s the \u201c news \u201d side of the Oscar debacle recently .\nOscars turned into political platforms .\nThe idiots speak .\nDurable fact-sorting and analysis have gone \u201c High Opinion \u201d too .\nSorry to say , most of that high-quality journalism has gone MIA .\nAdvocacy and opinion are a piss-poor substitute for facts and impacts .\nPeople are on television as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their looks as what \u2019 s upstairs which is why I never liked TeeVee .\nI was rather shocked to learn that the New York Times has a history of propaganda going back to early \u2019 30s .\nYou were a journalist in the early \u2019 70s .\nHow did propaganda play into media reporting at the time ?\nOr did it ?\nOh sure .\nThere were a lot of academic-led \u201c fringe radio stations \u201d around the local campuses .\nThat \u2019 s where the FM music revolution ( and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sense is that people are mainly too busy , though , feathering their own nests , to contemplate deeply on the long-term consequences of their actions .\nWhen we look at China today , from a longwave economics perspective , what do we see ?\nWell , China is going through their equivalent of America \u2019 s socialist wanted-to-be President for Life , Franklin Roosevelt .\nThe only difference between Xi Jinping and Roosevelt is which side of the world they \u2019 re on .\nThey experience Depressions \u2013 Roosevelt \u2019 s was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ come as the fallout to COVID-19 .\nThe left has tunnels into the NY Times and Xi ?\nWell , he has Xinhua .\nThere was also Stalin .\nWorking propaganda into the U.S. Labor movement throughout the 1930s and in the 1950s and 1960s the drug culture was used by the Russians to roll-up a blend of smoke-head politics that eventually leads to seasoned lefties ( like Bernie Sanders ) as being considered for President .\nThere \u2019 s a long-term globalist anti-America movement by the erudite Left worldwide ( George Soros @ @ @ @ @ @ @ borders , by some accounts ) and the difference between French , German , or Russia agitators is really minimal , I think .\nThey all hate America which explains the \u201c bum \u2019 s rush \u201d to take us down .\nIn your opinion , are Pseudo-events currently being pitched as real news ?\nIf so , how does the public authenticate the news as it reported ?\nOr is that even possible ?\nAuthentication is really easy : Just look at EVERY news story pitched off the Cyclops Box in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ question : \u201c Does this impact me in any personal way ?\n\u201d Ask your phone feeds .\nIf the answer is Yes it may be news .\nIf the answer is No , then you \u2019 re being info-scammed .\nSold , shaped , tuned , persuaded\u2026 .\n90 percent of the content won \u2019 t be \u201c news.\n\u201d Like a while back , there was a front page of Drudge Report on the home Amazon boss Jeff Bozos reportedly has purchased .\n$ 165-million .\nClearly , this is a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ invite George and Gaye ( with our spouses , of course ) over to his place for dinner .\nSo , why do I care ?\nYou ?\nOf course not .\nYet , it was \u201c clickbait \u201d for sheep .\nRemember my motto : Everything \u2019 s a Business Model !\nThat \u2019 s the whole secret of hype , though : Making it seem like something matters when it doesn \u2019 t .\nAnyone who would follow a 16-year old \u2019 s admonishments on Climate not only should have their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their right to vote since their mental acuity is demonstrably deficient\u2026 Along those lines , what news sources or specific journalists do you personally consider credible ?\nHate to admit this , but none \u2013 at least anymore .\nI sort-of trust government press releases that are data-based .\nNo one on a network unless Dean Sheppard is still around because he was ( and you might remember him ) at KING-TV in Seattle when I was chasing news up there .\nSame for Lou Dobbs .\nThe rest ?\nSkin galvanometer talking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ opinionated radicals like Rachel Maddow who I can \u2019 t stand .\nTucker Carlson \u2019 s OK. Nope , we \u2019 re all better off turning off the TV and while we \u2019 re going there , following Elon Musk \u2019 s advice , too : # DeleteFacebook .\nWay back when you were involved in a Web Bot project that tracked linguistic chatter to prophesize future economic , climate , and other world trends and events .\nIs that still a valid theory or has it been debunked ?\nRelated to that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( or pseudo-news ) becoming an in-your-face self-fulfilling prophecy ( \u201c if they read/hear/see it , they will come \u201d ) .\nI became \u201c unsold \u201d on that conception of a \u201c model space.\n\u201d Especially , as I was never allowed to see it .\nIn my own work , however , I outlined how you can more-easily spot manipulations in news by simply looking at the timeline and \u201c history \u201d track in modelspace of a particular \u201c narrative.\n\u201d No complicated linguistics needed .\nThat project was also too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a \u201c major storm \u201d or \u201c major quake \u201d and every six months , or so , there \u2019 s usually one somewhere in the world .\nThe prediction to hit ratio wasn \u2019 t far enough above the noise floor over a long sample period .\nPerhaps the most important question of all is this one : Is ethical Journalism dead ?\nLet me offer the alternative : How about Dimensionally-challenged .\nNews in a hyper-complex world must be multi-dimensional and a bit hyper to be useful .\nBiased , anti-American @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as a shining light country are all over the place .\nForced-choice reporting with a political agenda reigns supreme .\nJournalism just hasn \u2019 t kept up with these electronic times .\nLike a House that is always being reduced to 2-dimensional blueprints , the Reality of the house doesn \u2019 t appear until all three plan views ( front , sides , top ) are built and come into a whole context .\nThe news can be rolled into a single multidimensional presentation layer \u2013 just like printing is rolling over to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the breakthrough comes to the news industry using augmented reality , mixed reality , or full-on virtual so that all aspects of an events timeline , linkages , and future projections can be seen , crooks are holding us hostage to forced-choices .\nRead the far left , and read the far right .\nWhen they agree , that \u2019 s where our future may be .\nLast question then : Is the average American citizen intelligent enough to discern the truth from the bias the mainstream media appears to spew on a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dear friend , is conditional : Some yes , some no .\nIf a person can think and visualize in three dimensions and realizes that every single current event has formative historical antecedents , then hell yes .\nOn the other hand , if a person persists \u2013 between the ears \u2013 living in a 2-dimension \u201c Flat Lander \u2019 s World \u201d then we are all doomed because they are so easy to manipulate that Tower of Babel 2.0 will collapse as

"title": "Douglas Valentine Interview \u2014 How The COVID-19 Police State Was Born In Vietnam", "content": "By Whitney Webb , The Last American Vagabond Whitney : Today I am joined by the legendary author and researcher Doug Valentine , whose books , including The CIA as Organized Crime , among several others , are essential reading for understanding how covert and illegal intelligence operations have shaped , and continue to shape , conflict and policy in the U.S. and beyond .\nIn this interview , we will be focusing on what is probably Doug \u2019 s most well-known book , The Phoenix Program , which delves deeply into the CIA-backed covert terror and psyop campaign of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the war in Vietnam .\nMany have since referred to the Phoenix program as a civilian assassination program that killed an estimated 40,000 Vietnamese civilians .\nSome people say it \u2019 s even higher .\nToday , we will not only be discussing the history of Phoenix and its influence on so-called \u201c dirty wars \u201d in Latin America in the following decades , but also its use as a model for U.S .\nHomeland Security institutions that were created in the wake of the September 11th attacks as well as a roadmap @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disturbing boost amid the current coronavirus crisis .\nSo thanks for joining me today Doug .\nFirst things first , how are you doing in these crazy times ?\nDoug : You know , I \u2019 ve been social distancing for a long time , so I haven \u2019 t noticed much of it anyway .\nIt \u2019 s okay with me .\nYou know , I \u2019 m a writer , so I spend most of my time alone anyway , you know ?\nThirty five years locked up alone .\nAnd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ goes on around me .\nWhitney : Well , I can definitely relate to that as someone who spends most of my time writing as well .\nSo let \u2019 s get started then .\nSo , Doug , for people that may never have heard about the Phoenix program , can you briefly summarize what the Phoenix program was and how it fit into the CIA \u2019 s overall operations in Vietnam during this period of time ?\nDoug : Yeah , it \u2019 s hard , but I \u2019 ll try @ @ @ @ @ @ @ States started fighting in South Vietnam .\nIt sent troops in 1965 , but they noticed right away that they were not winning the hearts and minds of the civilians in South Vietnam , which had loyalty to the insurgents .\nThe communist insurgents represented the interests of the South Vietnamese more than the Americans and their allies in the South Vietnamese government .\nSo around 1967 , the Americans started what was called the other war .\nAnd it was a war for us to pacify the South Vietnamese .\nAnd the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Phoenix program .\nAnd the Phoenix program , which was created by the CIA , brought together all the police , military and intelligence services that were operating in South Vietnam and focused them along with all the civic institutions and the media , and you know , whatever else , whatever other apparatuses they could bring into the system of identifying and eliminating the communist cadres who were running the insurgency in South Vietnam .\nNow , these people were civilians .\nThese are not Viet Cong guerrillas .\nThey are people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ form [ ing ] a shadow government .\nThey \u2019 re people who proselytize in the villages .\nThey \u2019 re people who recruit people for the Viet Cong .\nThey deliver messages .\nThey serve basically a political function and they \u2019 re civilians .\nAnd so the military , the United States military , is legally prohibited from going out and arresting them .\nIt \u2019 s a police function , and so the CIA creates this apparatus , the Phoenix apparatus , and it focuses every police and paramilitary and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and then going out and capturing them or killing them or putting them in indefinite detention .\nThat \u2019 s the simple answer .\nThere is a whole incredibly complex context to how this all happens , OK ?\nBut essentially , it is a way of rooting out the communists cadres who are running the insurgency itself , Vietnam .\nWhitney : So one notable aspect of the Phoenix program was how it used ostensibly the diplomatic branches of the U.S. government , including the U.S. Agency for International Development , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so-called diplomatic agencies involved ?\nAnd how was their role in Phoenix at odds with public perception of these organizations ?\nDoug : Well , sure .\nYou know , what Phoenix did is it brought together existing programs .\nIt did not create a program itself .\nPhoenix was a coordination program .\nIt did not create units .\nAnd all these various , you know , components of Phoenix had been put in place by the United States when it initially came to South Vietnam in 1954 .\nThe United States @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was separated from South Vietnam .\nAnd about 700,000 Catholics fled North Vietnam , and they came to South Vietnam and they became the cadres for a lot of programs that the Agency for International Development was putting together in South Vietnam .\nThey created the Agency for International Development , which is a branch of the State Department in collaboration with the CIA\u2013created civic institutions throughout South Vietnam .\nThey created a junior chamber of commerce .\nThey created TV stations .\nThey created radio stations .\nThey created businesses\u2026 just spread @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nThey also created police services .\nThe American military came in and reorganized the entire South Vietnamese military under the guidance of American advisors , and the CIA went around and it created what were called civic action programs under cover of the Agency for International Development .\nSouth Vietnam was a country of deep poverty .\nThere \u2019 s a very , very famous episode of this in the book by Graham Greene called \u201c The Quiet American , \u201d which was written about these kind of events that were happening @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nA British reporter goes out and he finds that this CIA officer has created a medical dispensary and he is giving injections , immunizations to two poor South Vietnamese people as a way of trying to win them over to the new South Vietnamese government that the United States has created .\nSo , under cover of civic action of doing good deeds , the CIA , at the same time , is recruiting informants .\nIt \u2019 s recruiting people into its police and intelligence organizations , what it \u2019 s @ @ @ @ @ @ @ under cover of the Agency for International Development , all these various civic action programs throughout the entire , all of South Vietnam , using American money .\nAt the very basis of it is what \u2019 s called psychological warfare .\nAll of the Phoenix program , just like everything that \u2019 s happening in the United States today , is based on psychological warfare , convincing people through various means that , you know , if you support the American line , that this is in your best interest .\nFor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , who , you know , as refugees from North Vietnam who staffed out many of these civic action programs did not need to be indoctrinated in the idea that South Vietnam should fight godless communism .\nBut that is essentially what was happening .\nIt was an ideological war .\nIt was America bringing free enterprise to South Vietnam and the communists bringing secular humanism , which would meet the material needs of the South Vietnamese people .\nAnd so it became ideological warfare .\nThis is what underlies every aspect of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ same sort of ideological warfare playing out in the United States today , where people are , where Fox News , on the one hand , is presenting one message , and MSNBC is presenting another message .\nAnd the outlets are competing to try and psychologically move American political social movements in a particular direction .\nThat is exactly what was happening in South Vietnam from 1954 until 1967 when the Phoenix program was created .\nInstead of just having , you know , finding out on this information more basis , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ United States government to go out and kill these people .\nYou know , they \u2019 re tired of trying to talk and convince anybody to join their side .\nSo they set up an entire government apparatus that enables this to happen .\nAnd they create a judicial system in South Vietnam , which started in , I think it was 1966 , allows for the indefinite detention of anybody who \u2019 s considered a threat to national security .\nThere \u2019 s a secret government decree by the president of South @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the legal nail on which the Phoenix program hangs .\nThese people who are targeted in the Phoenix program , these communist cadres , are free individuals .\nThey \u2019 re civilians in South Vietnam .\nThey have a right to preach .\nThey are believers that , you know , land for the landless , you know , low rent economic cooperatives .\nThese are the sort of things that they were advocating for .\nPlus , which they were fighting in an actual war .\nBut the Phoenix decides that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is to the final solution of being able to arrest them without any criminal charges .\nThey can be now , these communist cadres , can be arrested .\nThey can be hunted down simply because they are designated as a threat to national security .\nAnd I would remind your audience that under Barack Obama , indefinite detention laws were activated in the United States ; created in the United States .\nAnd just as in , you know , all the things that we see happening are incrementally put in place @ @ @ @ @ @ @ put in place over a period of 10 , 15 years in South Vietnam until the Phoenix program came along .\nEverything was in place .\nThe legal , the justice of the system has been skewed so that military courts could be set up outside of the regular judicial system to try people arrested on these entree administrative detention laws .\nSo , of course , right away , if you find your name on the Phoenix blacklist and you can be arrested without charge and brought to a court without any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ government having to present evidence .\nAnd I should remind your audience again that all these things are in place now in the United States , too .\nJust like if you \u2019 re an immigrant , Mexican immigrant and you \u2019 re put in one of detention centers , you have no right to a lawyer .\nYou have no right to present evidence .\nI mean , you \u2019 re just there and you \u2019 re at the mercy of the state because you have this sort of criminal status , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ t done anything , you know ?\nAnd it sounds criminal created a crime .\nAnyway , so this whole judicial apparatus becomes what facilitates the Phoenix program and enables it to happen .\nSo you can \u2019 t just view it as a , as you know , as a bottle on a shelf with a label on it that says the Phoenix program and we have these little intelligence and operations coordinating centers around the country .\nIt \u2019 s put in place through all the systems , which the United @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Vietnam over many years , which we see incrementally happening here in the United States the same way .\nAt the very heart of it are two CIA created programs .\nThere \u2019 s two CIA created programs that are the foundation stones of the Phoenix program .\nOne of them is a network of interrogation centers .\nThey \u2019 re called province interrogation centers .\nThe CIA , through a company , an American company called Pacific Architects and Engineers , built an interrogation center in every province in South Vietnam .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ re like a state in the United States .\nAnd they turned these interrogation centers over to the special branch of the police , which is like our FBI .\nThe CIA paid the salaries of every member of the special branch of police .\nThey completely controlled this organization .\nThey recruited whoever they wanted into it .\nThey had psych op , you know , little Rorschach tests that they would give to people that they would recruit into the special branch of the police to make sure that they were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , you know , and stuff like that .\nAnyway , these interrogation centers are then soon packed with suspects of people who are thought to be members of the communist apparatus in South Vietnam .\nNow , all of a sudden the police are putting people who are political opponents .\nThey \u2019 re not communists at all .\nThey \u2019 re not communist cadres at all .\nThere you find your name on a Phoenix blacklist , and now all of a sudden , the police can go out and arrest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these torture chambers .\nAnd if you want to get out , your family has to pay a bribe .\nAnd before you know it , Phoenix becomes the greatest blackmail scheme that was ever created .\nAs one CIA officer told me , a guy named Lucien Conein , who is very famous , he said , do what I say or you \u2019 ll be seen .\nYou know , and there are no legal restrictions to who is put in these interrogation centers .\nIt \u2019 s whoever the special @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in them .\nAnd so sure enough , pretty soon , anybody who \u2019 s an opponent of the president of South Vietnam , you know , other nationalists , are finding themselves arrested and deemed to be suspects because you can be arrested on your suspicion .\nAll throughout South Vietnam , as part of the Phoenix program , is a network of informants .\nEverybody who \u2019 s a police informant , everybody who the military intelligence have people , they have informant nets .\nThe intelligence agency has informant nets @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Vietnam is just overrun by informants .\nAll these police intelligence .\nAnyway , it becomes a police state .\nAnd not only is it a police state .\nEverybody is scared to death that their name is going to end up on the on the Phoenix blacklist .\nSo Phoenix is much more .\nAnd again , that \u2019 s psychological warfare .\nIt \u2019 s much more than a program to identify and arrest the communist cadres .\nIt becomes a blanket way of oppression , of oppressing and scaring everybody @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whatever the government tells them to do .\nBecause even if you \u2019 re not a communist cadre , if you \u2019 re having an affair with some cop \u2019 s wife , well , you can be sure your name is gon na end up on the Phoenix blacklist .\nIf you \u2019 re a business man in a province in South Vietnam , and you \u2019 re in competition with the province chief for like a concrete business or , you know , a fruit stand , well , you can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ na end up on the Phoenix blacklist .\nAnd the Americans who are stamping out this program , who do not speak Vietnamese , are given names by the South Vietnamese police , and the American forces go out and arrest them and bring them to these interrogation centers and work at them .\nYou know , so all the sudden , it \u2019 s just a blanket way of pacifying the country and making sure that everybody does exactly what they \u2019 re told to do .\nThen , the other foundation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the CIA created\u2026 the counter-terror teams were formed from people who are in South Vietnamese prisons .\nThey were guys who had deserted from the South Vietnamese army .\nThey were created from minority groups in South Vietnam who \u2019 d been oppressed by the Vietnamese .\nAnd these people were put into little groups\u2013seven , eight , ten men groups , which were the death squads that the CIA ran .\nThey would go out and they would target individuals who belong to the communist cadres and when they would go out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into these interrogation centers or kill them , they would kill every member of their family .\nThey would kill not just the individual that they were going after , but they would terrorize everybody in that area .\nSo , this added another layer of fear and terror in South Vietnamese society that not only if you end up on the Phoenix blacklist can you be brought into an interrogation center , can you be arrested and put into indefinite detention\u2026 can be sent to some God-awful prison that \u2019 s like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Calcutta .\nYou know , where people were chained to stone walls and had acid poured on or , you know , just the most horrible conditions .\nBut you could have one of these counter-terror teams , these crew teams come into your village and not just kill the communist cadre there , but kill anybody who could be in any way associated with him\u2013his family , his friends , the neighbors .\nYou know , it just became a way of organizing South Vietnamese society through terror , which is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ United States today .\nFor somebody like me , who is 70 years old , it \u2019 s nothing new because I remember McCarthy era .\nI remember as a kid at high school\u2026 I mean , in grade school in the 1950s , having to crawl under my desk , you know , because everybody was afraid the Russians were going to drop atomic bombs on us .\nI remember as a little kid , you know , five , six years old , worried that there was strontium-90 in my milk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , you know , blowing up atomic bombs in Nevada .\nYou know , so this is the way America works periodically every ten , fifteen , twenty years .\nThere \u2019 s another way of terrorizing Americans into toeing the line , and that line is inevitably anti-secular humanism .\nIt \u2019 s anti-communism ; anti-Godless communism .\nAnd you \u2019 re scared and you \u2019 re petrified and you \u2019 re terrorized into believing that there \u2019 s forces outside the world , whether they \u2019 re immigrants or communists or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all our freedoms and drop bombs on us or do whatever .\nAnd unless you absolutely toe the line and buy the government line , your life \u2019 s in danger .\nThis is just how the United States organizes itself and how it has been organizing itself for , you know , like I said , at least as long as I \u2019 ve been alive .\nWhitney : So , one often overlooked aspect of Phoenix that I think is really relevant to what \u2019 s going on today , too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was its use of technology , including the use of the so-called supercomputers of the era to analyze data .\nAnd that that would be used to choose which people to target with this program .\nAnd I find this interesting because Yasha Levine had a book called \u201c Surveillance Valley , \u201d and in there he discusses how the framework of today \u2019 s mass surveillance systems with the Internet and Silicon Valley and the NSA and all of that was also born during the Vietnam conflict .\nSo can you elaborate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Phoenix program and how the evolution of technology has allowed the U.S. government \u2019 s use of Phoenix-style tactics to evolve as well ?\nDoug : Absolutely , yes .\nIt \u2019 s very important .\nSo the Phoenix program sets up what are called Intelligence and Operations Coordinating Centers , IOCs in a district it \u2019 s called a DIOC ; a District Intelligence Operations Coordinating Center .\nIn a province , it \u2019 s a PIOC .\nOK ?\nAnd it \u2019 s staffed by a combination of Americans and South @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And they go out and they identify in their little area , just like the Department of Homeland Security nowadays , through its fusion centers , identify as anybody who \u2019 s a terrorist surrogate in their area .\nThese Phoenix IOC people would go out and identify and make up a list of all the suspects who are part of this communist cadre command and control apparatus .\nAnd then they would fill out reports and they would send them back to a Phoenix directorate in Saigon .\nI talked to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ directorate in Saigon .\nI also talked with a guy named Nelson Brickham who created the Phoenix program .\nHe based it on a Ford corporation model .\nThe organizers in Phoenix and all these reports that are coming in from districts and from provinces are put into a CIA computer .\nThey \u2019 re digitized and that was called the Ph\u1ee5ng Ho\u00e0ng management information system .\nOn the Vietnamese version of Phoenix , it was called Phung Ho\u00e0ng .\nSo , now everybody who \u2019 s a suspect throughout all of South @ @ @ @ @ @ @ biographical information put into a computer program .\nI asked William Colby about it , the guy who was running Phoenix at the time .\nAnd he said , well , you know , we don \u2019 t necessarily believe that just because your name was in the system that you were a communist cadre , but it was fun to play around with .\nBut , you know , that \u2019 s just the CIA officer blowing smoke .\nI mean , once your name is in that computer , your life @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u2019 re there , and it \u2019 s actually available online .\nThey \u2019 ve actually put this system\u2026 you can actually go look at it online nowadays .\nThe Phoenix program management information system is the first computerized system for law enforcement and national security .\nAnd pretty soon , MIDA Corporation in the United States is developing a similar program for the Justice Department in the United States .\nAnd it becomes the national criminal information system in the United States .\nSupposedly , it \u2019 s just criminals who are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can be sure that the FBI and the CIA , which very early on had a program called Chaos , Operation Chaos , which began in the United States at the same time the Phoenix program did in June 1967 , were also compiling their own computer systems of the data on anybody who could be considered anti-war during the Vietnam War .\nAnybody who was a member of the Black Panthers .\nAnybody who was in the civil rights movement and could be said to have communist sympathies .\nAll these people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ computer systems that were developed on the Phoenix program model in the CIA and in the FBI .\nAnd it \u2019 s for political purposes , not for criminal purposes .\nIt \u2019 s now all the information that can be gathered about you from CIA informants who are inside police departments , the red squads of police departments , the CIA goes throughout the United States and recruits assets in every police department that reports about anybody who could be said to be anti-America .\nAll that information started in 1967 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which again are based on this Phoenix program model and actually became a big scandal in 1974 when Seymour Hersh revealed the CIA \u2019 s domestic spying program .\nIt was called the \u201c family jewels , \u201d you know , for those of us who were maligned at the time and had been protesting the war , you know , it was nothing new .\nEverybody knew they were doing it , you know , you could never be sure who was an informant for the FBI or the police or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nFor regular American society , it was kind of a shock , but just let your audience know these sorts of things have been going on forever .\nAs soon as there were computers , the CIA and the FBI were using them to track anybody who that could be considered to be a subversive .\nAnd again , you \u2019 re considered a subversive for purely ideological reasons\u2013you \u2019 re for godless communism .\nThe one thing you can \u2019 t be is a secular humanist .\nYou know , that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the country who is for black liberation , for equal whites , for blacks , the ending of Jim Crow laws\u2013any of that\u2013you become a political subversive .\nAnd that \u2019 s just the way it is in the United States .\nAnd I should add the drug war is a huge part of this .\nThis surveillance system that we \u2019 re talking about right now , and at the same time , that the CIA and the FBI in 1967 are developing computer programs , so was the DEA , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Narcotics and Dangerous Drugs .\nIt was systematizing .\nIt had gone from an organization , the Bureau of Narcotics , that consisted of 300 guys to an organization that consisted of thousands of agents and all of whom have to show or all of whom go through what \u2019 s called motivational indoctrination programs to make sure that they adhere to the ideology and that they follow the party line .\nYou can \u2019 t get into the CIA , you can \u2019 t get into the FBI or the DEA @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you exhibit even the smallest subversive tendencies .\nSo , anybody who these become the people who staff the security organizations in the United States , whether it \u2019 s the DEA , the FBI , the CIA , you name it , you know , it \u2019 s even hard to get elected to a political position , not unless you adhere to the party line , which is basically the business party line .\nOK ?\nSo , again , it \u2019 s the psychological warfare and the construction of systems @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right ?\nBut also the Justice Department systems , who can be tried for what ?\nWhat kind of laws are created , including tax laws ?\nYou know ?\nAll these or the whole system is geared to terrorize and make people afraid of stepping out of line .\nAnd that is the reason why the United States , like people in the United States , are so incapable of breaking out of this all lock box that we \u2019 re in .\nYou know , it \u2019 s incapable of effecting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It \u2019 s really the United States having been at the forefront of technology , of critical thought , has used all that technology and critical thought simply to consolidate power in fewer and fewer hands , which is why you see more billionaires all the time .\nThis is why you see the consolidation of information and fewer and fewer outlets .\nYou know , it \u2019 s using all this power , all this technology , all this secret knowledge to just create a very closed society and at the same @ @ @ @ @ @ @ re free .\nYou \u2019 re free to worship whatever you want .\nYou know ?\nYou can worship Dave Koresh .\nYou can worship Jim Jones .\nYou can shoot Lysol in your veins if you want .\nIf someone tells you to , you know , you \u2019 re free , you can do whatever you want .\nAnd it doesn \u2019 t , you know , it doesn \u2019 t matter that this stuff is self-destructive .\nIt doesn \u2019 t matter that it results in our health care system\u2026 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ apparent in the last couple of months .\nThere is no safety net for Americans .\nAnd a lot of it goes back to the systems that were put in place ; the methodologies of the Phoenix program .\nWhitney : So in your book on the Phoenix program , you talk about how this campaign of terror and this political warfare wasn \u2019 t just used on the Vietnamese people , but also was used on Americans in terms of its use as a psychological operation or psyop .\nSo can you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ psyops on the American public and touch briefly on how these tactics , these same psyop tactics had been used in the decade since ?\nDoug : Yeah , sure .\nIt begins with the militarization of the police forces .\nThere was a time I remember when I was a kid , again , when cops walked around the street .\nThey didn \u2019 t even have patrol cars .\nYou know , they had a billy club and they knew everybody .\nYou know , you \u2019 re going to New @ @ @ @ @ @ @ War , at the time of , you know , the Phoenix program , it \u2019 s developing , there are huge anti-war demonstrations .\nAnd just as the Phoenix forces in South Vietnam relied on paramilitary police forces in order to put down dissent , that became the methodology here in the United States .\nYou start seeing the development of SWAT teams .\nAnd people are told that these SWAT teams , which patrol the United States and military paramilitary formations with military gear are there for their benefit .\nThat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u2019 re an enemy of the state and you have to have these militarized police forces in order to protect businesses from , you know , somebody throwing a brick through their window in the course of a demonstration .\nSo that becomes accepted as truth .\nThis is something that gets ingrained into the mind of the population\u2013that militarized police forces are there for their benefit because they \u2019 re going to protect your businesses from rioters .\nAnd of course , again , this bleeds over into the civil rights movement @ @ @ @ @ @ @ demonstrating and stuff like that .\nSo nowadays you never see that anymore .\nYou rarely ever see any kind of demonstration against the police state because the police state is incrementally , since Vietnam , more highly militarized .\nAnd it \u2019 s almost impossible for anybody , you know , anybody on the street to get together the kind of firepower , the kind of force that is necessary to overcome the militarized police that can be called out in a moment \u2019 s notice .\nYou saw this in Boston @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were military tanks patrolling the streets of Boston .\nYou know , and people just stayed inside and said , thank God for the military and the police .\nThey \u2019 re protecting us from terror .\nSo people by , you know , within the last ten , fifteen years have accepted this plus , which , since Vietnam , there \u2019 s been this psychological warfare of militarizing civil society .\nAnd this is largely done through the actions of rich businessmen .\nWho fear that their businesses would suffer if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nAnd so the military is constantly glorified everywhere .\nAgain , we never saw this when I was young .\nLet me just try to put it in a little historical context .\nWhen we were kids , there was a Memorial Day parade and World War I veterans and a couple of World War ll veterans would walk down the street .\nAnd that was once a year .\nMost of , you know , for guys like me who grew up in the 50s and 60s , most of our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ army , hated the army .\nThey wanted nothing to do with it .\nBut Vietnam , again , changes stuff .\nAll of a sudden , if you \u2019 re not fighting communism , you \u2019 re anti-America .\nAnd that drives a wedge through civil society .\nIt \u2019 s important to understand how if you don \u2019 t venerate , if you don \u2019 t make displays of worshiping and glorifying the military , you \u2019 re considered anti-America .\nThat has become evident , for example , with Colin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ game .\nAll right ?\nAll of a sudden he \u2019 s deemed to be unpatriotic and he can \u2019 t get a job .\nHe took a knee for social justice and he was said to be anti-military .\nHe suffered economic harm .\nAnd this becomes an example .\nThis is psychological warfare to everybody who is watching .\nNo matter how you feel about things , your feelings don \u2019 t matter .\nIf you \u2019 re a pacifist and you advocate pacifism , you \u2019 re considered anti-military and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like the cops that are protecting us .\nYou \u2019 re considered anti-America .\nAnd this has infused all of American civil society .\nThe basic assumption of American society is that you have to be pro-military .\nAnd that \u2019 s why we have 800 military bases around the world and nobody thinks , well , why do we have 800 military bases around the world ?\nYou know , I mean , what are they doing ?\nYou know ?\nAnd why do we have to\u2026 you know , why is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are we spending billions and billions and trillions of dollars on military hardware ?\nWell , it \u2019 s because everybody is scared shitless of saying I \u2019 m against it , because if you do , you could lose your job just like Colin Kaepernick lost his job , if you talk against the military .\nAnd this is the essence of what it means to be an American in the 21st century .\nAnd since 9/11 , it \u2019 s just become exponentially greater .\nAnd the burden on people to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nature .\nIt \u2019 s just something that they have to do .\nIf you don \u2019 t do it , you \u2019 re shunned and you risk social , you know , distancing from good flag-waving Americans and stuff like that .\nSo we \u2019 re very brainwashed .\nAt the root of it is the need to maintain the American military empire\u2013these 800 bases around the world that assure the very rich that they will have cheap labor forces , that their goods will flow from foreign countries where products are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ United States because these bases serve to control the shipping lanes and to keep American transportation open , you know , and flowing .\nAlso , 800 military bases around the world means that the United States has political influence in all those countries .\nOut of every one of these 800 bases , there are CIA officers creating informant networks outside those bases , OK , and infiltrated all the countries where they \u2019 re in .\nAnd again , doing the same sorts of things that were done in the Phoenix @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all these different countries who can be counted on to support the American line .\nThey know everything about everybody , all these surveillance systems that you \u2019 re talking about .\nThese are all based on all these military bases and all the CIA stations that are set up in every country around the world .\nThey \u2019 re not just gathering this kind of Phoenix information on Americans here at home , they \u2019 re gathering on everybody in the world .\nAnd that \u2019 s what this military base archipelago @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the United States that they know everything that \u2019 s going on around the world about everybody and every citizen , except for the few countries where they have a hard time , you know , establishing a military base .\nWhitney : Right .\nSo , you just brought this up , but to ask a question on this point specifically , you have said in articles and other writings that the September 11th attacks , quote , \u201c lifted all the moral prohibitions on militaristic America , \u201d end quote @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Phoenix program home to roost .\nAnd you specifically pointed to the Department of Homeland Security as being modeled on aspects of the Phoenix program .\nSo I just want to ask you to elaborate a little more on that point , specifically how Phoenix has influenced post-9/11 policies and institutions in the U.S. Doug : Yeah , sure .\nSo the department\u2026 George Bush created an Office of Homeland Security within weeks of 9/11 .\nAnd then it was under a guy named Tom Ridge , I believe , originally\u2026 I started @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Counterpunch .\nYou know , I \u2019 m talking about how this was Phoenix had come home to roost .\nAnd in 2002 , I can \u2019 t remember which month , Bush announced the creation of the Department of Homeland Security .\nFor example , it totally reorganized law enforcement in the United States , and it included military forces that are here stationed in the United States .\nI think it \u2019 s called NORTHCOM .\nIt \u2019 s the military units that are based here in the United States .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ , you know , regular American\u2026 regular army forces .\nThey become part of Homeland Security , as does the CIA .\nNow , the restrictions are limited or eliminated so that now the CIA can start operating domestically in the United States as part of this Homeland Security apparatus that settle in every state .\nAnd its intention is to protect what \u2019 s called the critical infrastructure , which includes Microsoft , Google .\nIt includes the transportation industry .\nIt includes , you know , you just name it .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ these\u2026 anywhere that you have a member , an industry , apart again\u2026 now , going back to what I was telling you about how the CIA set up civil society inside Vietnam through the Agency for International Development and was able to manipulate all of civil society because the CIA had set it up and put its agents and its informants and its assets in place and , you know , in positions of power .\nWell , this is what the Department of Homeland Security starts doing .\nIt starts forming @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that are involved in the critical infrastructure .\nAnd it recruits them into its Department of Homeland Security apparatus .\nAnd these people report back to the Department of Homeland Security on anybody who appears to be stepping out of line .\nYou know , there \u2019 s a guy named Ed Snowden over there , who seems to be smuggling CDs out of the , you know , out of corporate headquarters at night or something like that .\nYou know , they \u2019 re just people .\nIt \u2019 s the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I told you that flooded South Vietnam\u2026 well , through the Department of Homeland Security , they now have a network of informants that completely covers and blankets the United States through this critical infrastructure apparatus , which is tied into the Department of Homeland Security , and all these people who are recruited to work for Department of Homeland Security are selected , again through these kind of Rorschach tests , to make sure that they can be assimilated and that they will preach the party line , and now not only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ threats , OK ?\nThey \u2019 re informing on everybody who they think is anti-America , who \u2019 s , you know , anti-war , whatever .\nAnd this covers the whole country .\nAnd then it begins to create this whole parallel secret society of people who are , you know , really can be counted on at a time of crisis to toe the line .\nYou know , I suppose you must know that ICE , Immigration and Customs Enforcement , is part of the Department of Homeland Security .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ know , independent agency .\nIt falls under the rubric of Department of Homeland Security .\nIt \u2019 s people in the Department of Homeland Security who have set up detention centers all around the country so that\u2026 and you know about this from your study , Continuity in Government , and the vast amount of detention centers that have been set up here , and especially on military bases here in the United States , that in a time of crisis , if people started acting out , the Department of Homeland @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the indefinite detention of statutes , can activate them in a minute , and people can be put in indefinite detention throughout this entire Department of Homeland Security network that exists around the United States .\nThat has been incrementally expanded and perfected and computerized since 2002 .\nAnd then , lo and behold , in 2020 , there is a virus attack and a national emergency , which activates the whole Department of Homeland Security apparatus .\nIt all goes into high alert .\nAnd you don \u2019 t know about it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ decrees , there are executive orders which you don \u2019 t know about , which are out of the Homeland Security Fusion Centers , which operate exactly like these intelligence operations , coordination centers that Phoenix had .\nI mean , they \u2019 re modeled exactly on them .\n[ These centers ] can actually reach into civil society .\nAnd they can create militias of people who are ideologically attuned , and they can have them go .\nAnd when Donald Trump says liberate Michigan , liberate Maryland , liberate whatever state @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his political opponent , they get it .\nIt \u2019 s this whole Phoenix system that \u2019 s used for political purposes .\nLike it was in South Vietnam .\nAnybody who is opposing the president of South Vietnam found themselves on a Phoenix list .\nIt \u2019 s political control of this whole apparatus out of the White House .\nDonald Trump can say to this Homeland Security apparatus , liberate these people , and before you know it , militias\u2013armed militias\u2013guys with guns dressed in camo fatigues , waving pro-Trump flags @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It doesn \u2019 t matter what kind of flag it is , you know , just as long as it \u2019 s rah , rah , are out on the streets .\nAnd this is what a national emergency has in store .\nIf it gets worse , this whole\u2026 very right-wing , pro-military apparatus that exists through the Department of Homeland Security , which involves these kind of , really , you know , right-wing militias , can be activated , and they can go on and start functioning just like armed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ teams that the CIA is set up through the Phoenix program in South Vietnam .\nThey can start acting like counterterror teams .\nThey can , you know , clandestinely go to somebody \u2019 s home at night and knock \u2018 em off .\nAnd you think Trump is going to do anything about it ?\nDo you think that the police forces and the FBI and the CIA , which are all ideologically attuned with this movement , are going to do anything about it ?\nNo , because it \u2019 s @ @ @ @ @ @ @ consolidate forces , and we have to rally around the flag .\nSo that is the absolute worst case scenario of what the Covid emergency could result in\u2013is this consolidation of a fascist state in the United States through the Department of Homeland Security , which is based on the Phoenix program in South Vietnam and may be moving towards the same ends .\nI don \u2019 t want to scare everybody , but , you know , that \u2019 s what the potential is .\nIt \u2019 s there .\nWhitney : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with this current crisis that really concern me is that since beginning in January , at least , what we \u2019 ve been told , it \u2019 s been the National Security Council , the intelligence community and the Pentagon , who have been drafting still classified plans for Coronavirus response in the events at a certain number of cases is triggered .\nWe \u2019 ve also heard mentions of what we \u2019 ve mentioned a couple of times in our discussion , Continuity of Government has been referenced in recent reports in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ alluded to earlier , having activated already a specific task force in Washington , D.C. Newsweek is even talking about the possibility of martial law and things of this nature .\nIt \u2019 s all very disturbing .\nBut to give a little context of Continuity of Government programs for listeners that may not be familiar\u2026 , in the 1980s we had these Phoenix-style operations being implemented by the CIA in Latin America , in places like El Salvador and Nicaragua and other places\u2026 so while that was going on , Oliver North @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were developing the foundation for another Phoenix-style program for use in the U.S. domestically that included one of these high tech , you know , databases of subversives called Main Corp. And this was all under the guise of a Continuity of Government program whereby Americans were deemed unfriendly by the state .\nThey could either be surveilled or detained if this plan were ever to be activated .\nAnd of course , these plans , they still exist today .\nThey were briefly activated after the attacks on September 11th , 2001 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they \u2019 ve been coming back up now in relation to the Coronavirus crisis .\nSo could you talk about how the legacy of the Phoenix program has influenced these continuity of government plans from the 1980s and in the years since ?\nDoug : Sure .\nYou know , I mean , I had the advantage of having interviewed some of the people that actually put these programs in place .\nOK ?\nI started investigating and researching Phoenix in 1984 , in the height of the Iran-Contra controversy .\nYou know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exploding around 1986 , I think that \u2019 s what this guy , Eugene Hasenfus , first was captured , and it led to revelations that the CIA was transporting cocaine to the United States .\nThere was just a terrible , terrible scandal that , of course , Congress contained .\nYou know , because Congress was behind all of this .\nBut I was interviewing CIA officers at that time , and one of the CIA officers I interviewed was a guy named Donald Gregg .\nYes , Donald Gregg , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ letter , was working as George Bush \u2019 s national security adviser .\nGeorge Bush was vice president at the time .\nAnd I had heard that Donald Gregg had been involved in the Phoenix program in South Vietnam .\nSo I sent him a letter at the White House .\nAnd one day I \u2019 m sitting around at home and my wife says , hey , Doug , there \u2019 s a guy on the phone , Donald Gregg .\nAnd he says , hey , Doug , how you doing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ How are you ?\nHe said , I \u2019 ve got nothing to do at the White House today .\nIf you want to do that interview about the Phoenix program , let \u2019 s do it .\nOK , at that time , I was in good with the CIA .\nAll that changed later on .\nBut at that point , they still liked me .\nAnyway , so he explained how him and a guy named Rudy Enders and another guy named Felix Rodriguez , who was an anti-Castro Cuban @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1970 with the Phoenix program to round up Communist cadres in in South Vietnam .\nOK ?\nHe described it in detail , and it \u2019 s in my book .\nIt \u2019 s in my Phoenix program book .\nAnd he introduced me to this guy , Rudy Enders , who had been his paramilitary deputy .\nOK ?\nDonald Gregg was what was called a region officer in charge .\nHe was a very senior CIA officer in South Vietnam .\nAnd he was in charge of all region lll , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ country .\nAnd Rudy was his paramilitary adviser deputy , and Rudy Enders commanded all the CIA \u2019 s paramilitary forces and in region lll .\nOK ?\nThe ones that organized the attacks on communist cadres , the death squads , the armed propaganda teams , all that kind of stuff .\nAnd Rudy Enders \u2019 deputy was this anti-Castro Cuban guy , Felix Rodriguez .\nWell , Donald sends me to Rudy Enders , and Rudy Enders had just finished being\u2026 after Vietnam , he had become head of the CIA @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is all its paramilitary forces around the world .\nAnd it was Rudy Enders , Donald Gregg and this guy , Felix Rodriguez , who put together what was , you know , people now call the Salvador option , where they actually imported the Phoenix program model that they used from in South Vietnam into El Salvador and Nicaragua .\nAnd Rudy Enders and Donald Gregg explained to me in painful detail exactly how they did that and how they set up the Contras in Nicaragua and forces all throughout Central America @ @ @ @ @ @ @ s not just that the Phoenix program goes from South Vietnam to Central America in the 1980s .\nIt \u2019 s the same CIA officers that control it .\nAnd now they \u2019 re higher up in the hierarchy .\nThere , Donald Gregg is advisor to George Bush .\nRudy Enders is running the entire Special Operations division .\nThey have taken the lessons from South Vietnam and not only applied them in South America , Central America , but because they now have worldwide responsibilities , they \u2019 re using the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ using it everywhere in the world .\nAnd that \u2019 s exactly what happens .\nIt \u2019 s at this point , and this is really crucial to understand , that American military forces no longer view these kind of operations against civilians as violating the laws of war .\nVery important to understand\u2026 when Phoenix was set up in South Vietnam , a lot of military officers rejected the idea of American soldiers being involved in the CIA program , going after civilians .\nBut through the 1980s , thanks to Donald @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Felix Rodriguez , the military starts absorbing Phoenix methods and organizations working against civilians as they did , you know , in the wars in Central America at that time were wars against civilians , OK ?\nAnd now , by the time Bill Clinton becomes president , you have guards from special forces who are running the Joint Chiefs of Staff .\nAnd after 9/11 , military forces are completely infiltrated by the CIA and they have been politicized .\nIt \u2019 s the politicization of the officer corps and the United @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at West Point as how you go into foreign countries and control them .\nAnd there is no longer\u2026 yeah\u2026 very important to understand\u2026 the CIA actually infiltrates the United States \u2019 military and reorganizes the military .\nSo now it \u2019 s more geared towards fighting civilian populations , as in the occupation of Iraq , as in Afghanistan .\nNow , this is what the American military does .\nYou don \u2019 t see tanks rolling across Europe .\nYou don \u2019 t see battleships , you know , U.S. battleships @ @ @ @ @ @ @ battleships .\nAll that is a thing of the past .\nThe United States and its military have been politicized , and this is how it polices the world through Phoenix-style operations of identifying insurgents , put it into a computer , terrorizing their families and the surrounding population so that they toe the American line , so that American colonies like in Iraq and Afghanistan can exist in peace without any dissent .\nIt \u2019 s hard to explain it all in detail , but this is how it has evolved .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ home to roost , what I \u2019 m saying to you is the whole ideology of the politicization of the military , making militarism , sort of , you know , like a sacred holy institution has no effect at all of American psychology .\nThis is the environment , the intellectual or anti-intellectual environment that we live in .\nAnd nothing represents this anti-intellectual , pro-military , pro-business ideology better than Donald Trump .\nHe is the absolute perfect spokesman for it .\nAnd it seems beyond coincidental that he \u2019 s @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any president who had any kind of intellectual integrity at all would not be spouting the sorts of things that he spouts .\nAnd it almost seems like , you know , the way Barack Obama was seemed like to be a CIA plant to advance the interests of the United States in North Africa , Central Asia and then the Middle East , that Donald Trump is the CIA player in the presidency now to make sure that all this gets brought\u2026 all this Phoenix-style organization of society is brought back to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the glorification of the military .\nYou know , nobody was harder on Colin Kaepernick than Trump .\nYou know , it just all seems to be put in place .\nAnd while he runs his parallel reality TV show out of the White House , the military and the CIA and the FBI and the Department of Homeland Security are doing their thing .\nThey are reorganizing American society , American ethics , to make it more compatible with the interests of big business and the military .\nAnd that \u2019 s @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was like , you know , just the one hour version\u2026 it \u2019 s very complex .\nBut it happens , you know , on a million different fronts .\nWhitney : Well , I think one thing that \u2019 s interesting about Trump being president right now , why all of this is going on , is that a lot of people on the right that would normally protest or be very against authoritarian overreach of a government in this way\u2026 some of them , particularly through the Qanon movement and all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lot of these policies with some people even asking that Trump declare martial law , in some cases when these people , if it was Obama or any other president , probably would totally oppose that type of policy .\nSo I think it \u2019 s kind of interesting in that regard , but I think it \u2019 s worth pointing out that whether it \u2019 s someone like Joe Biden who wrote the foundation for the Patriot Act or someone like Donald Trump , so many of the politicians that get to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ support these policies .\nRight ?\nBut , this brings me all to my last question , which is about sort of , you know , everything that \u2019 s going on right now with the current Coronavirus crisis , because in the past couple of months I mentioned earlier this some covert , classified planning done by intelligence agencies , the National Security Council and the military .\nBut in addition , we have seen a public government push for new , quote , unquote , \u201c emergency powers , \u201d including @ @ @ @ @ @ @ requesting indefinite detention powers .\nWe \u2019 re also seeing Jared Kushner promote an increased surveillance system under the guise of contact tracing and things like this .\nIt \u2019 s worth pointing out that both Barr and Kushner \u2019 s wife , Ivanka Trump , were promoting these same policies last fall , saying that they would help prevent mass shootings before they occur .\nAnd now they are going to help us ostensibly combat Coronavirus .\nSo what do you think about these recent pushes for greatly increased government power and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Americans should be concerned in light of the Phoenix program \u2019 s legacy that we \u2019 ve been discussing ?\nDoug : Sure , these things happen incrementally .\nOne of the things I \u2019 m trying to do is give you a broader historical view .\nEvery 10 or 15 years , another piece is put in place , another crisis occurs and civil liberties are restricted even further .\nAnd so you don \u2019 t have to be a genius to see the arc of how things are moving and in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I mean , if you look at it historically , you can just see how it \u2019 s drifting , where it \u2019 s going .\nAnd if you use your imagination , you can see what \u2019 s going to happen next .\nYou know , because it has always been going in the same direction and it always goes that way after an emergency , whether it \u2019 s a concocted emergency or provocation or whether it \u2019 s an emergency that the through propaganda has been spun out of proportion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nIt \u2019 s almost like you can believe these are all coincidences , or you could think that maybe it \u2019 s part of some bigger plan .\nAnd the military and the CIA and the National Security Council all have plans , strategic plans\u2013 20 , 30 , 40 years into the future .\nThey know what \u2019 s gon na happen with the world economy better than we do .\nThey know where resources are available that we don \u2019 t .\nThey adjust their strategic plans to make sure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that they \u2019 re going to need to maintain power , and they organize society to make sure that that happens .\nAnd these organizational systems are well-thought out .\nThey are highly technical .\nThey \u2019 re the people who are experts .\nThey know things that we don \u2019 t .\nThey have a lot of secret knowledge .\nWe \u2019 re dominated as a society by this secrecy .\nWe don \u2019 t know .\nBut the people in control do know and they do know what \u2019 s going @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plans for what \u2019 s going to happen next .\nAnd it all just follows the same arc of where it \u2019 s going and what \u2019 s happening .\nI myself feel like it all has to do with diminishing resources or a population that \u2019 s worldwide that \u2019 s increasing .\nThere \u2019 s , you know , Malthusian plans in the future to make sure that the rich political elite have access to these resources , you know , through psychological warfare .\nThe great deal , the majority @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they have in store for us .\nIt still seems very bleak to me , you know , and especially with\u2026 if you throw climate change into the mix .\nI thought the next crisis was going to be a climate change crisis .\nI didn \u2019 t foresee the virus as the pretext for this next ratcheting up for reduction of civil liberties and an increase of police and surveillance powers .\nBut that \u2019 s the way it \u2019 s going .\nAnd that \u2019 s the way it \u2019 s @ @ @ @ @ @ @ s just the way it \u2019 s going to continue to go until , you know , something happens .\nYou know , people organize in some way for their own self-interests .\nIt \u2019 s bleak , you know ?\nAnd the last thing I would say is , you know , Bill Barr is a really scary guy .\nWhitney : Yeah , I would agree with that .\nDoug : I think your audience is probably a lot more aware of all these things .\nWhitney : Well , that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ s always important in times like this , especially with so many people being in quarantine or lockdown to spend that time , you know , educating ourselves about what \u2019 s going on now , but also how we got here .\nAnd so there \u2019 s no one I would rather talk to you about how we got here than you .\nSo thank you so much for your time in discussing all of these , you know , this arc , as you put it , from the Phoenix program @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a lot of really rich context that can help people understand not just what \u2019 s going on now , but what the plan is in the not-so-distant future .\nRight ?\nSo with that being said , I also wanted to ask you about the recent republication of your novel .\nIf you would please talk about that for a little bit and tell people how they can follow your work and learn more about you .\nDoug : A book I wrote a long time ago , 20 years ago , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it \u2019 s an allegory as to what \u2019 s happening now about how secret operations , how are we as naive , self-interested people get sucked into the government \u2019 s covert operations ; the secrecy that you were just talking about .\nAnd when I said secrecy dominates our lives , it \u2019 s true that the great secret is how we \u2019 re dominated , you know , how do we get out of it ?\nThat \u2019 s what everybody wants to know .\nAnd this book TDY is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about a particular person who gets involved in an intelligence , a covert intelligence operation , and how it affects him for the rest of his life .\nIt has the fact of all this secrecy , of all this repression , of all this surveillance , affects each and every one of us psychologically .\nAnd it \u2019 s damaging to our health .\nIt as damaging to our health to be part of the society with all these covert operations , with all this police repression , with all this disinformation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whether it \u2019 s daytime or nighttime .\nAll of this has an effect on an individual who \u2019 s involved in a covert operation .\nBut it also has a psychological effect on society as a whole .\nWe all , all of us Americans are suffering from a kind of a PTSD .\nWe \u2019 re constantly going through the shock of one trauma after another .\nAnd we don \u2019 t know what the purpose of these shocks is .\nWe have no control over them .\nAnd it makes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know who we are as individuals and makes us not know who we are as a society .\nOur bosses are denying us .\nThey \u2019 re telling us we \u2019 re free and at the same time , through their blanket secrecy , are denying us any knowledge of who we really are .\nAnd this book , TDY , is an allegory of how that happens .\nAnd what it means to each one of us individually , and that if we understand that as individuals that we are damaged by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that we \u2019 re really not free , then , really , that \u2019 s the starting point for starting to do something about it , to make ourselves healthy and whole so that we can understand what \u2019 s going on .\nWhat is the starting point ?\nSo read that book .\nWhen you read it , understand that it \u2019 s an allegory and that you really have a responsibility , each and every one of us , as an individual , to first know who you are and how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an individual , and then start reaching out to other people to become self-actualized so that we can create a self-actualized society .\nWhitney : Well , well put .\nWell , to wrap things up , can you tell people if they can follow you on social media , your website , where they can buy your books , anything like that ?\nDoug : Yeah , just go to douglasvalentine.com Whitney : OK. And I believe Doug is also on Twitter as well for people that are on , you know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ All right .\nWell , thanks so much again , Doug , for giving us , well , an over an hour and a half of your time .\nGreatly appreciated .\nI greatly appreciate it .\nAnd I \u2019 m sure my audience does as well .\nSo thanks , everyone , for tuning in and we \u2019 ll see you guys soon .\nQuestion

capability to track individuals @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enforcement agents to use video cameras and continually scan everybody who walks by .\nAccording to the report , several major police departments have expressed an interest in this type of real-time tracking .\nDocuments revealed agencies in at least five major cities , including Los Angeles , either claimed to run real-time face recognition off of street cameras , bought technology with the capability , or expressed written interest in buying it .\nIn all likelihood , the federal government heavily involves itself in helping state and local

encourages and funds a giant nationwide surveillance net and then taps into the information via fusion centers and the Information Sharing Environment ( ISE ) .\nFusion centers were sold as a tool to

"Coronavirus Gives a Dangerous Boost to DARPA\u2019s Darkest Agenda", "content": "By Whitney Webb , The Last American Vagabond Technology developed by the Pentagon \u2019 s controversial research branch is getting a huge boost amid the current coronavirus crisis , with little attention going to the agency \u2019 s ulterior motives for developing said technologies , their potential for weaponization or their unintended consequences .\nIn January , well before the coronavirus ( Covid-19 ) crisis would result in lockdowns , quarantines and economic devastation in the United States and beyond , the U.S. intelligence community and the Pentagon were working with the National Security Council to create still-classified plans to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has since been alleged that the intelligence and military intelligence communities knew about a likely pandemic in the United States as early as last November , and potentially even before then .\nGiven this foreknowledge and the numerous simulations conducted in the United States last year regarding global viral pandemic outbreaks , at least six of varying scope and size , it has often been asked \u2013 Why did the government not act or prepare if an imminent global pandemic and the shortcomings of any response to such an event were known ?\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ frequently been written off as mere \u201c incompetence \u201d in mainstream media circles , it is worth entertaining the possibility that a crisis was allowed to unfold .\nWhy would the intelligence community or another faction of the U.S. government knowingly allow a crisis such as this to occur ?\nThe answer is clear if one looks at history , as times of crisis have often been used by the U.S. government to implement policies that would normally be rejected by the American public , ranging from censorship of the press to mass @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the September 11 attacks , like the Patriot Act , may be the most accessible example to many Americans , U.S. government efforts to limit the flow of \u201c dangerous \u201d journalism and surveil the population go back to as early as the First World War .\nMany of these policies , whether the Patriot Act after 9/11 or WWI-era civilian \u201c spy \u201d networks , did little if anything to protect the homeland , but instead led to increased surveillance and control that persisted long after the crisis that spurred them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a lens , it is possible to look at the current coronavirus crisis to see how the long-standing agendas of ever-expanding mass surveillance and media censorship are again getting a dramatic boost thanks to the chaos unleashed by the coronavirus pandemic .\nYet , this crisis is unique because it also has given a boost to a newer yet complimentary agenda that \u2014 if fulfilled \u2013 would render most , if not all , other government efforts at controlling and subduing their populations obsolete .\nFor years , the Pentagon \u2019 s Defense @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has remained largely out of sight and out of mind for most Americans , as their research projects are rarely covered by the mainstream media and , when they are , their projects are often praised as \u201c bringing science fiction movies to life.\n\u201d However , there have been recent events that have marred DARPA \u2019 s often positive portrayal by media outlets , which paint the agency as a beacon of scientific \u201c progress \u201d that has \u201c changed the world \u201d for the better .\nFor instance , in 2018 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the DARPA \u2019 s \u201c Insect Allies \u201d program of actually being a dystopian bioweapons program that would see insects introduce genetically modified viruses into plants to attack and devastate a targeted nation \u2019 s food supply .\nDARPA , of course , maintained that its intent to use these insects to genetically modify plants was instead about \u201c protecting \u201d the food supply .\nRegardless of DARPA \u2019 s assertions that it is merely a \u201c defensive \u201d program , it should be clear to readers that such a technology could easily @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the wielder .\nThough DARPA \u2019 s futuristic weapons of war often get the most attention from media , the agency has longstanding interests in tinkering with , not just the biology of plants , but of humans .\nDARPA , which is funded to the tune of approximately $ 3 billion a year , has various avenues through which it pursues these ambitions , with many of those now under the purview of the agency \u2019 s \u201c Biological Technologies Office \u201d ( BTO ) , created in 2014 .\nAs of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ human biology and biotech projects at its BTO have been getting a massive PR boost thanks to the current coronavirus crisis , with recent reports even claiming that the agency \u201c might have created the best hopes for stopping Covid-19.\n\u201d Most of these technologies garnering positive media coverage thanks to Covid-19 were developed several years ago .\nThey include the DARPA-funded platforms used to produce DNA and RNA vaccines , classes of vaccine that has never been approved for human use in the U.S. and involve injecting foreign genetic material into the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this very class of vaccine , now being produced by DARPA-partnered companies , that billionaire and global health \u201c philanthropist \u201d Bill Gates recently asserted has him \u201c most excited \u201d relative to other Covid-19 vaccine candidates .\nYet , key aspects regarding these vaccines and other DARPA \u201c healthcare \u201d initiatives have been left out of these recent positive reports , likely because they provide a window into what is arguably the agency \u2019 s darkest agenda .\nIn 2006 , DARPA announced its Predicting Health and Disease ( PHD ) program @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an individual will develop an infectious disease prior to the onset of symptoms.\n\u201d The PHD program planned to accomplish this by \u201c identifying changes in the baseline state of human health through frequent surveillance \u201d with a specific focus on \u201c viral , upper respiratory pathogens.\n\u201d Three years later , in 2010 , DARPA-funded researchers at Duke University created the foundation for this tool , which would use the genetic analysis of blood samples to determine if someone is infected with a virus before they show symptoms .\nReports at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u201d would be transmitted to \u201c a national , web-based influenza map \u201d available via smartphone .\nFollowing the creation of DARPA \u2019 s BTO in 2014 , this particular program gave rise to the \u201c In Vivo Nanoplatforms ( IVN ) \u201d program .\nThe diagnostics branch of that program , abbreviated as IVN : Dx , \u201c investigates technologies that incorporate implantable nanoplatforms composed of bio-compatible , nontoxic materials ; in vivo sensing of small and large molecules of biological interest ; multiplexed detection of analytes at clinically relevant concentrations ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ using implanted electronics for communication.\n\u201d Past reports on the program describe it as developing \u201c classes of nanoparticles to sense and treat illness , disease , and infection on the inside .\nThe tech involves implantable nanoparticles which sense specific molecules of biological interest.\n\u201d DARPA \u2019 s IVN program has since helped to finance and produce \u201c soft , flexible hydrogels that are injected just beneath the skin to perform [ health ] monitoring and that sync to a smartphone app to give the use immediate health insights , \u201d a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ DARPA-funded and National Institutes of Health ( NIH ) -funded company Profusa .\nProfusa , which has received millions upon millions from DARPA in recent years , asserts that the information generated by their injectable biosensor would be \u201c securely shared \u201d and accessible to \u201c individuals , physicians and public health practitioners.\n\u201d However , the current push for a national \u201c contact tracing \u201d system based on citizens \u2019 private health data is likely to expand that data sharing , conveniently fitting with DARPA \u2019 s years-old goal of creating a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nProfusa is also backed by Google , which is intimately involved in these new mass surveillance \u201c contact tracing \u201d initiatives , and counts former Senate majority leader William Frist among its board members .\nThey are also partnered with the National Institutes of Health ( NIH ) The company also has considerable overlap with the diagnostic company Cepheid , which recently won FDA approval for its rapid coronavirus test and was previously awarded lucrative government contracts to detect anthrax in the U.S. postal system .\nAs of this past March , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if their injectable biosensors can predict future pandemics , including the now widely predicted \u201c second wave \u201d of Covid-19 , and detect those infected up to three weeks before they would otherwise show symptoms .\nThe company expects to have its biosensors FDA licensed for this purpose by early next year , about the same time a coronavirus vaccine is expected to be available to the general public .\nAnother long-standing DARPA program , now overseen by BTO , is known as \u201c Living Foundries.\n\u201d According to DARPA \u2019 s website @ @ @ @ @ @ @ adaptable , scalable , and on-demand production of [ synthetic ] molecules by programming the fundamental metabolic processes of biological systems to generate a vast number of complex molecules that are not otherwise accessible .\nThrough Living Foundries , DARPA is transforming synthetic biomanufacturing into a predictable engineering practice supportive of a broad range of national security objectives.\n\u201d The types of research this \u201c Living Foundries \u201d program supports involves the creation of \u201c artificial life \u201d including the creation of artificial genetic material , including artificial chromosomes , the creation of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ using artificial genetic material to \u201c add new capacities \u201d to human beings ( i.e .\ngenetically modifying humans through the insertion of synthetically-created genetic material ) .\nThe latter is of particular concern ( though all are honestly concerning ) , as DARPA also has a project called \u201c Advanced Tools for Mammalian Genome Engineering , \u201d which \u2013 despite having \u201c mammalian \u201d in the name \u2013 is focused specifically on improving \u201c the utility of Human Artificial Chromosomes ( HACs ) , \u201d which DARPA describes as a \u201c fundamental @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , vaccines , and cellular diagnostics.\n\u201d Though research papers often focus on HACs as a revolutionary medical advancement , they are also frequently promoted as a means of \u201c enhancing \u201d humans by imbuing them with non-natural characteristics , including halting aging or improving cognition .\nDARPA is known to be involved in research where these methods are used to create \u201c super soldiers \u201d that no longer require sleep or regular meals , among other augmented \u201c features , \u201d and has another program about creating \u201c metabolically dominant \u201d fighters @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the other , very disconcerting use of these same technologies , \u201c genetic weapons \u201d that would \u201c subvert DNA \u201d and \u201c undermine people \u2019 s minds and bodies.\n\u201d Another potential application being actively investigated by DARPA is its BioDesign program , which is examining the creation of synthetic organisms that are created to be immortal and programmed with a \u201c kill switch \u201d allowing a synthetic , yet organic organism to be \u201c turned off \u201d at any time .\nThis has led some to speculate such research could open @ @ @ @ @ @ @ human replicants \u201d used for fighting wars and other tasks , such as those that appear in the science fiction film Bladerunner .\nHowever , these genetic \u201c kill switches \u201d could also be inserted into actual humans through artificial chromosomes , which \u2013 just as they have the potential to extend life \u2013 also have the potential to cut it short .\nNotably , it was revealed in 2017 that DARPA had invested $ 100 million in \u201c gene drive \u201d research , which is involves the use of genetic modification to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it it often referred to as a \u201c genetic extinction \u201d technology .\nIn addition , other DARPA experiments involve the use of genetically modified viruses that insert genetic material into human cells , specifically neurons in the brain , in order to \u201c tweak \u201d human brain chemistry .\nIn one example , DARPA-funded research has altered human brain cells to produce two new proteins , the first allowing neural activity to be easily detected by external devices and the second allowing \u201c magnetic nanoparticles \u201d to \u201c induce an image or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u201d Changing human brain chemistry and functionality at the cellular level is only one of numerous DARPA initiatives aimed at changing how human beings think and perceive reality .\nSince 2002 , DARPA has acknowledged its efforts to create a \u201c Brain-Machine Interface ( BMI ) .\n\u201d Though first aimed at creating \u201c a wireless brain modem for a freely moving rat , \u201d which would allow the animal \u2019 s movements to be remotely controlled , DARPA wasn \u2019 t shy about the eventual goal of applying such brain \u201c enhancement @ @ @ @ @ @ @ soldiers to \u201c communicate by thought alone \u201d or remotely control human beings ( on the enemy side only , so they say ) for the purposes of war .\nThe project , which has advanced greatly in recent years , has long raised major concerns among prominent defense scientists , some of whom warned in a 2008 report that \u201c remote guidance or control of a human being \u201d could quickly backfire were an adversary to gain access to the implanted technology ( opening up the possibility of \u201c hacking \u201d a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they also raised concerns about the general ethical perils of such technologies .\nWork began in 2011 on developing \u201c brain implants \u201d for use in human soldiers , officially with the goal of treating neurological damage in veterans , and such implants have been tested on human volunteers in DARPA-funded experiments since at least 2015 .\nConcerns , like those raised by those defense scientists in 2008 , have been regularly dismissed by DARPA , which has consistently claimed that its controversial research projects are tempered by their in-house \u201c ethical experts.\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ DARPA \u2019 s leadership views these ethical conundrums , since they ultimately have the last word .\nFor example , in 2015 , Michael Goldblatt , then-director of DARPA \u2019 s Defense Sciences Office ( DSO ) , which oversees most aspects of the agency \u2019 s \u201c super soldier \u201d program , told journalist Annie Jacobsen that he saw no difference between \u201c having a chip in your brain that could help control your thoughts \u201d and \u201c a cochlear implant that helps the deaf hear.\n\u201d When pressed about the unintended @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that \u201c there are unintended consequences for everything.\n\u201d Thus , it is worth pointing out that , while DARPA-developed technologies \u2013 from human genetic engineering to the brain-machine interfaces \u2013 are often first promoted as something that will revolutionize and improve human health , DARPA sees the use of these technologies for such ends as being on the same footing as other dystopian and frankly nightmarish applications , like thought control .\nBMIs are no exception , having first been promoted as a way to \u201c boost bodily functions of veterans with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and to allow amputees to control advanced prosthetics .\nWhile these do indeed represent major medical advances , DARPA \u2019 s leadership has made it clear that they see no distinction between the medical use of BMIs and using them to exert near total control over a human being by \u201c guiding \u201d their thoughts and even their movements .\nSuch stark admission from DARPA \u2019 s leadership makes it worth exploring the state of these current \u201c brain-machine \u201d interface programs as well as their explicit goals .\nFor instance , one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Next-Generation Nonsurgical Neurotechnology ( N3 ) program involves using \u201c noninvasive or minimally invasive brain-computer interfaces \u201d to \u201c read and write \u201d directly onto the brain .\nAccording to one recent report on DARPA \u2019 s N3 program , one example of \u201c minimally invasive \u201d technologies would involve : Though the purported goal of N3 is related to creating \u201c thought-controlled \u201d weapons that react and fire based on a soldier \u2019 s thoughts , the fact that the technology is also bidirectional , opens up the disturbing possibility that efforts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a soldier \u2019 s thoughts and perceptions as opposed to the other way around .\nThis may be more of the plan than DARPA has publicly let on , since official military documents have openly stated that the Pentagon \u2019 s ultimate goal is to essentially replace human fighters with \u201c self-aware \u201d interconnected robots \u201c who \u201d will both design and conduct operations against targets chosen by artificial-intelligence systems .\nThis weapons system of the not-so-distant future seems to have little room for human beings , even those capable of \u201c controlling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that futurist military planners see soldiers with BMIs as a \u201c weapon \u201d that would also become connected to this same AI-driven system .\nIt is also worth pointing out that DARPA has been attempting to create an \u201c artificial human brain \u201d since 2013 .\nIn addition , reports on DARPA \u2019 s BMI efforts have suggested that this bidirectional technology will be used to \u201c cloud the perception of soldiers \u201d by \u201c distancing them from the emotional guilt of warfare , \u201d a move that would set a dangerous precedent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a marked jump in war crimes .\nOf course , these are just the admitted , potential \u201c military \u201d applications of such technology .\nOnce this technology moves from the military to the civilian sphere , as several DARPA inventions have in the past , their use for \u201c remote guidance \u201d , \u201c thought control \u201d and/or the programming of thoughts and experiences is more than likely to be misused by governments , corporations and other power-brokers in the U.S. and beyond for the purposes of control .\nThe entrance of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ t very far away , as DARPA executives and researchers who have worked on the N3 and other DARPA-backed BMI programs have since been \u201c scooped up \u201d by Verily ( a Google-GlaxoSmithKline partnership ) , Elon Musk \u2019 s Neuralink and Facebook \u2019 s Building 8 \u2013 all of which have been working to bring \u201c neuro-modulation \u201d devices and BMIs to market .\nAs detailed above , DARPA often frames the controversial technologies it develops as being developed to mainly advance medicine and healthcare .\nAside from the technologies already discussed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ DARPA has been very interested in healthcare , specifically vaccines , for some time .\nFor instance , in 2010 , DARPA began developing a class of vaccine that could \u201c inoculate against unknown pathogens , \u201d a component of its Accelerated Manufacture of Pharmaceuticals program .\nThe vaccine would inject thousands of synthetic antibodies , such as those developed through DARPA \u2019 s \u201c Living Foundries \u201d program , into the human body .\nThese synthetic antibodies or \u201c synbodies \u201d would then \u201c create an immunity toolkit that can be combined @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pathogen.\n\u201d That same year , DARPA began funding efforts to create \u201c multiagent synthetic DNA vaccines \u201d that would be delivered into the human body via \u201c noninvasive electroporation \u201d and was quickly promoted in media reports as a way to quickly produce vaccines compared to traditional vaccine production methods .\nThis category of vaccine would involve the same type of synthetic DNA that DARPA was also simultaneously researching for the purposes of both \u201c enhancing \u201d and \u201c subverting \u201d human beings at the genetic level .\nIt was also this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Melinda Gates Foundation also began heavily funding DNA and RNA vaccines .\nDNA vaccines , which were first created in 2005 , have never been approved for human use in the United States and past studies have warned that they \u201c possess significant unpredictability and a number of inherent harmful potential hazards \u201d and that \u201c there is inadequate knowledge to define either the probability of unintended events or the consequences of genetic modifications.\n\u201d Another longstanding issue with such vaccines is mitigating \u201c unwanted immune reactions \u201d that result from natural @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they contain .\nIn 2011 , DARPA announced its \u201c Rapidly Adaptable Nanotherapeutics \u201d program , which seeks to create a \u201c platform capable of rapidly synthesizing therapeutic nanoparticles \u201d aimed at combating \u201c evolving and even genetically engineered bioweapons.\n\u201d DARPA \u2019 s plan for these nanoparticles , which media reports described merely as \u201c tiny , autonomous drug delivery systems , \u201d was to combine them with \u201c small interfering RNA ( siRNA ) , \u201d which are snippets of RNA that can target and shut down specific genes .\nAs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ siRNA could be reprogrammed \u2018 on-the-fly \u2019 and applied to different pathogens , \u201d allowing nanoparticles to \u201c be loaded up with the right siRNA molecules and sent directly to cells responsible for the infection.\n\u201d The creation of this program was shortly followed by DARPA \u2019 s decision in 2013 to fund Moderna Therapeutics to the tune of $ 25 million to develop their synthetic RNA vaccine production platform .\nDARPA funded the project to \u201c develop platform technologies that can be deployed safely and rapidly to provide the U.S. population with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ engineered biological weapons.\n\u201d Then , in 2015 , DARPA \u2019 s research into vaccines involving synthetic antibodies and synthetic genetic material expanded , with them giving $ 45 million to the DNA vaccine company , Inovio Pharmaceuticals .\nThis same year , DARPA-funded RNA and DNA vaccines began to be framed differently by both DARPA researchers and the media \u2013 who described the technology as transforming the human body into a \u201c bio-reactor.\n\u201d In the years since , DARPA-backed DNA and RNA vaccine companies , including Moderna , Inovio as well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been unable to get their products licensed for human use , largely due to the fact that their vaccines have failed to provide sufficient immunity in human trials .\nExamples of these ineffective vaccines include CureVac \u2019 s attempt at a rabies vaccine and Moderna \u2019 s efforts to create a vaccine for the Zika virus ( which was funded by the U.S. government ) .\nSeveral workarounds for this issue have been proposed , including vaccines where the genetic material ( RNA or DNA ) \u201c self-amplifies.\n\u201d However , the workaround @ @ @ @ @ @ @ response and other obstacles for DNA/RNA vaccines is the incorporation of nanotechnology into these vaccines .\nAs a result , the use of nanoparticles as the carriers for the genetic material in these vaccines has been widely promoted and studied , as well as touted as the best way to improve their stability , increase their targeted delivery ability and enhance the immune response they provoke .\nThe combination of DNA or RNA vaccines with nanotechnology has already become reality thanks to the companies leading that field .\nFor instance , the DARPA-backed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reports refer to as \u201c DNA nanotechnology \u201d in their line of synthetic vaccines branded as \u201c SynCon \u201d by the company , which uses an undisclosed computer algorithm to design its vaccines .\nIt is an interesting coincidence , then , that the Inovio \u201c SynCon \u201d vaccine for Covid-19 now appears to be ahead of the rest of the pack , with backing from Bill Gates , DARPA , the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases ( NIAID ) and other government agencies .\nIn January , the Coalition for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it would begin funding vaccine candidates for the coronavirus outbreak , long before it became a major global issue .\nCEPI describes itself as \u201c a partnership of public , private , philanthropic and civil organizations that will finance and co-ordinate the development of vaccines against high priority public health threats \u201d and was founded in 2017 by the governments of Norway and India along with the World Economic Forum ( WEF ) and the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation .\nThat month , CEPI only chose two pharmaceutical companies to receive funding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for Covid-19 \u2013 Moderna and Inovio Pharmaceuticals .\nAs previously mentioned , these two companies are DARPA-backed firms that frequently tout their \u201c strategic alliance \u201d with DARPA in press releases and on their websites .\nDARPA has also provided these companies with significant amounts of funding .\nFor instance , the top funders behind Inovio Pharmaceuticals include both DARPA and the Pentagon \u2019 s Defense Threat Reduction Agency ( DTRA ) and the company has received millions in dollars in grants from DARPA , including a $ 45 million grant to develop @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also recently awarded over $ 8 million from the U.S. military to develop a small , portable intradermal device for delivering DNA vaccines , which was jointly developed by Inovio and the U.S. Army Medical Research Institute of Infectious Diseases ( USAMRIID ) , which also manages the \u201c biodefense \u201d lab at Fort Detrick .\nIn addition , the German company CureVac , which is also developing a CEPI-backed RNA vaccine for Covid-19 , is another long-time recipient of DARPA funding .\nThey were one of DARPA \u2019 s earliest investments in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ million DARPA contract to develop their \u201c RNActive \u201d vaccine platform in 2011 .\nIn Moderna \u2019 s case , DARPA financed the production and development of their RNA vaccine production platform and their RNA therapy candidate for Chikungunya virus ( their first for an infectious disease ) was developed in direct collaboration with the agency .\nSince 2016 , Moderna \u2019 s RNA vaccine program has received $ 100 million in funding from the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation .\nThe Gates Foundation has since poured millions directly into both Moderna \u2019 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ efforts .\nGates \u2019 backing of DNA and RNA vaccines is significant , given that Gates \u2013 a billionaire with unparalleled influence and control over global healthcare policy \u2013 recently asserted that the best options for a Covid-19 vaccine are these same vaccines , despite the fact that they have never before been approved for use in humans .\nYet , thanks to the emergency authorizations activated due to the current crisis , both Moderna \u2019 s and Inovio \u2019 s testing for these vaccines has skipped animal trials and gone straight to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be fast-tracked for widespread use in a matter of months .\nModerna \u2019 s clinical trial in humans began in mid-March , followed by Inovio \u2019 s in the beginning of April .\nThus , they are not only Gates \u2019 favorites to be the new vaccine , but are also slated to be the first to complete clinical trials and garner emergency U.S. government approval , especially Moderna \u2019 s vaccine which is being jointly developed with the government \u2019 s NIH .\nThe rapid rise to prominence of Moderna \u2019 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has resulted in several media articles praising DARPA as having provided our \u201c best hope \u201d for thwarting the coronavirus crisis .\nIn addition to its backing of Moderna \u2019 s and Inovio \u2019 s own efforts , DARPA itself , specifically DARPA \u2019 s BTO , is set to have a \u201c temporary \u201d vaccine for Covid-19 available in a matter of weeks that will involve the production of synthetic antibodies that would ostensibly provide immunity for a few months until a longer-lasting vaccine ( such as those produced by Moderna and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ s antibody treatment for Covid-19 is pursuing two routes , including the \u201c human body as bio-reactor \u201d approach that would involve synthetic DNA or RNA being injected in order to prompt the body to produce the necessary antibodies .\nDefense One notes that DARPA \u2019 s Covid-19 treatment would utilize techniques that had resulted from the agency \u2019 s investments in microfluidics ( the manipulation of liquids at the sub-millimeter range ) , nanotechnology fabrication and \u201c new approaches to gene sequencing.\n\u201d While most media reports have painted these DARPA-led efforts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ noting that concerns have been raised , though these concerns have hardly gotten the coverage they warrant .\nFor instance , Nature recently noted some key points regarding safety issues related to the race for a Covid-19 vaccine , including the fact that all \u201c previous coronavirus vaccines have not all proven appropriate or even safe , \u201d with some past attempts at coronavirus vaccines having resulted in antibody dependent enhancement ( ADE ) .\nADE results in cells more rapidly taking up the virus and speeding up the virus \u2019 replication , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also noted that the two coronavirus vaccines for SARS that managed to pass phase 1 trials ended up , in subsequent studies , causing immune hypersensitivity in mice \u201c resulting in severe immunopathology , \u201d i.e .\npermanent defects or malfunctions in the immune system .\nIn addition , Nature also pointed out that it is unknown how strong an immune response is needed to confer immunity for Covid-19 and coronaviruses in general , making it incredibly difficult to gauge if a vaccine is even effective .\nAnother issue worth noting involves concerns @ @ @ @ @ @ @ firm Citron Research , which compared Inovio to Theranos , the disgraced medical technology company that had initially promised to offer diagnoses for numerous diseases via a simple blood test , but was later revealed to be a sham .\nCitron asserted that \u201c It \u2019 s been over 40 years since Inovio was founded , yet the company has NEVER [ sic ] brought a product to market , and all the while insiders have enriched themselves with hefty salaries and large stock sales.\n\u201d Citron Research went on to say that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ designed their Covid-19 vaccine in only 3 hours based on a computer algorithm was hard to believe , stating that \u201c Inovio has a \u2018 computer algorithm \u2019 that no one else in the world has and is arguably one of the greatest breakthroughs in vaccine discovery in the past 100 years , and yet this \u2018 computer algorithm \u2019 is not mentioned once in any of its 10-K \u2019 s or 10-Q \u2019 s ?\nSounds like Theranos to us.\n\u201d It also noted that Inovio \u2019 s partnerships with pharmaceutical companies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those two companies canceling the partnership despite claims from Inovio \u2019 s CEO that whey would \u201c continue to thrive.\n\u201d Of course , these are just concerns focused on corporate behavior and obstacles towards making a Covid-19 vaccine in general .\nAs this report has already shown in detail , DARPA \u2019 s other experiments with the same technologies ( particularly genetic engineering , synthetic chromosomes , and nanotechnology ) that are being used to produce RNA and DNA vaccines for Covid-19 are arguably more concerning .\nThis is especially true given @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u201c strategic partners \u201d of the agency are those manufacturing these vaccines .\nIn addition , thanks to backing from the U.S. government and Bill Gate , among others , they are are also slated to be among the first vaccines ( if not the first ) approved for widespread use .\nIt is certainly troubling that media coverage of DARPA \u2019 s efforts and the efforts of Moderna and Inovio have thus far not included critical reporting regarding the different branches of DARPA \u2019 s research that has produced the technology involved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ room for public scrutiny of their safety , efficacy and their potential for unintended effects on human genetics .\nThis is particularly alarming given that , over the past several weeks , efforts have been taking shape in many countries to enforce mandatory vaccinations once a Covid-19 vaccine becomes available .\nIn some countries , it appears likely that the Covid-19 vaccine will not be made mandatory per say , but will be required for those who wish to return to any semblance of \u201c normalcy \u201d in terms of public gatherings , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ s home for longer periods of time and so on .\nWould those involved in creating such a mandatory vaccine , e.g .\nDARPA , pass up the opportunity to utilize the same technologies involved in producing the vaccine for some of their other admitted goals ?\nThis question , of course , has no obvious answer , but the fact that the arc of DARPA \u2019 s research is aimed at the weaponization of human biology and genetics in a way that is ripe for misuse , suggests very worrying possibilities that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ merely looks at how the crisis has been a boon for the Orwellian plans of the National Security Commission on Artificial Intelligence ( NSCAI ) and the federal government \u2019 s current efforts to dramatically increase its powers amid the current crisis , it becomes increasingly difficult to give government agencies like DARPA and their corporate partners like Moderna and Inovio the benefit of the doubt .\nThis is especially true given that \u2013 without a major crisis such as that currently dominating world events \u2013 people would likely be unreceptive to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ DARPA has been developing , whether their push to create cyborg \u201c super soldiers \u201d or injectable BMIs with the capability to control one \u2019 s thoughts .\nYet , amid the current crisis , many of these same technologies are being sold to the public as \u201c healthcare , \u201d a tactic DARPA often uses .\nAs the panic and fear regarding the virus continues to build and as people become increasingly desperate to return to any semblance of normalcy , millions will willingly take a vaccine , regardless of any government-mandated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and desperate will not care that the vaccine may include nanotechnology or have the potential to genetically modify and re-program their very being , as they will only want the current crisis that has upended the world to stop .\nIn this context , the current coronavirus crisis appears to be the perfect storm that will allow DARPA \u2019 s dystopian vision to take hold and burst forth from the darkest recesses of the Pentagon into full public view .\nHowever , DARPA \u2019 s transhumanist vision for the military and for humanity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to human freedom , but an existential threat to human existence and the building blocks of biology itself .\nQuestion Everything , Come To Your Own Conclusions .\nAlso See : Bill Gates Partners With DARPA &

Dangerous Boost to DARPA\u2019s Darkest Agenda", "content": "By Whitney Webb , The Last American Vagabond Technology developed by the Pentagon \u2019 s controversial research branch is getting a huge boost amid the current coronavirus crisis , with little attention going to the agency \u2019 s ulterior motives for developing said technologies , their potential for weaponization or their unintended consequences .\nIn January , well before the coronavirus ( Covid-19 ) crisis would result in lockdowns , quarantines and economic devastation in the United States and beyond , the U.S. intelligence community and the Pentagon were working with the National Security Council to create still-classified plans to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has since been alleged that the intelligence and military intelligence communities knew about a likely pandemic in the United States as early as last November , and potentially even before then .\nGiven this foreknowledge and the numerous simulations conducted in the United States last year regarding global viral pandemic outbreaks , at least six of varying scope and size , it has often been asked \u2013 Why did the government not act or prepare if an imminent global pandemic and the shortcomings of any response to such an event were known ?\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ frequently been written off as mere \u201c incompetence \u201d in mainstream media circles , it is worth entertaining the possibility that a crisis was allowed to unfold .\nWhy would the intelligence community or another faction of the U.S. government knowingly allow a crisis such as this to occur ?\nThe answer is clear if one looks at history , as times of crisis have often been used by the U.S. government to implement policies that would normally be rejected by the American public , ranging from censorship of the press to mass @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the September 11 attacks , like the Patriot Act , may be the most accessible example to many Americans , U.S. government efforts to limit the flow of \u201c dangerous \u201d journalism and surveil the population go back to as early as the First World War .\nMany of these policies , whether the Patriot Act after 9/11 or WWI-era civilian \u201c spy \u201d networks , did little if anything to protect the homeland , but instead led to increased surveillance and control that persisted long after the crisis that spurred them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a lens , it is possible to look at the current coronavirus crisis to see how the long-standing agendas of ever-expanding mass surveillance and media censorship are again getting a dramatic boost thanks to the chaos unleashed by the coronavirus pandemic .\nYet , this crisis is unique because it also has given a boost to a newer yet complimentary agenda that \u2014 if fulfilled \u2013 would render most , if not all , other government efforts at controlling and subduing their populations obsolete .\nFor years , the Pentagon \u2019 s Defense @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has remained largely out of sight and out of mind for most Americans , as their research projects are rarely covered by the mainstream media and , when they are , their projects are often praised as \u201c bringing science fiction movies to life.\n\u201d However , there have been recent events that have marred DARPA \u2019 s often positive portrayal by media outlets , which paint the agency as a beacon of scientific \u201c progress \u201d that has \u201c changed the world \u201d for the better .\nFor instance , in 2018 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the DARPA \u2019 s \u201c Insect Allies \u201d program of actually being a dystopian bioweapons program that would see insects introduce genetically modified viruses into plants to attack and devastate a targeted nation \u2019 s food supply .\nDARPA , of course , maintained that its intent to use these insects to genetically modify plants was instead about \u201c protecting \u201d the food supply .\nRegardless of DARPA \u2019 s assertions that it is merely a \u201c defensive \u201d program , it should be clear to readers that such a technology could easily @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the wielder .\nThough DARPA \u2019 s futuristic weapons of war often get the most attention from media , the agency has longstanding interests in tinkering with , not just the biology of plants , but of humans .\nDARPA , which is funded to the tune of approximately $ 3 billion a year , has various avenues through which it pursues these ambitions , with many of those now under the purview of the agency \u2019 s \u201c Biological Technologies Office \u201d ( BTO ) , created in 2014 .\nAs of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ human biology and biotech projects at its BTO have been getting a massive PR boost thanks to the current coronavirus crisis , with recent reports even claiming that the agency \u201c might have created the best hopes for stopping Covid-19.\n\u201d Most of these technologies garnering positive media coverage thanks to Covid-19 were developed several years ago .\nThey include the DARPA-funded platforms used to produce DNA and RNA vaccines , classes of vaccine that has never been approved for human use in the U.S. and involve injecting foreign genetic material into the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this very class of vaccine , now being produced by DARPA-partnered companies , that billionaire and global health \u201c philanthropist \u201d Bill Gates recently asserted has him \u201c most excited \u201d relative to other Covid-19 vaccine candidates .\nYet , key aspects regarding these vaccines and other DARPA \u201c healthcare \u201d initiatives have been left out of these recent positive reports , likely because they provide a window into what is arguably the agency \u2019 s darkest agenda .\nIn 2006 , DARPA announced its Predicting Health and Disease ( PHD ) program @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an individual will develop an infectious disease prior to the onset of symptoms.\n\u201d The PHD program planned to accomplish this by \u201c identifying changes in the baseline state of human health through frequent surveillance \u201d with a specific focus on \u201c viral , upper respiratory pathogens.\n\u201d Three years later , in 2010 , DARPA-funded researchers at Duke University created the foundation for this tool , which would use the genetic analysis of blood samples to determine if someone is infected with a virus before they show symptoms .\nReports at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u201d would be transmitted to \u201c a national , web-based influenza map \u201d available via smartphone .\nFollowing the creation of DARPA \u2019 s BTO in 2014 , this particular program gave rise to the \u201c In Vivo Nanoplatforms ( IVN ) \u201d program .\nThe diagnostics branch of that program , abbreviated as IVN : Dx , \u201c investigates technologies that incorporate implantable nanoplatforms composed of bio-compatible , nontoxic materials ; in vivo sensing of small and large molecules of biological interest ; multiplexed detection of analytes at clinically relevant concentrations ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ using implanted electronics for communication.\n\u201d Past reports on the program describe it as developing \u201c classes of nanoparticles to sense and treat illness , disease , and infection on the inside .\nThe tech involves implantable nanoparticles which sense specific molecules of biological interest.\n\u201d DARPA \u2019 s IVN program has since helped to finance and produce \u201c soft , flexible hydrogels that are injected just beneath the skin to perform [ health ] monitoring and that sync to a smartphone app to give the use immediate health insights , \u201d a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ DARPA-funded and National Institutes of Health ( NIH ) -funded company Profusa .\nProfusa , which has received millions upon millions from DARPA in recent years , asserts that the information generated by their injectable biosensor would be \u201c securely shared \u201d and accessible to \u201c individuals , physicians and public health practitioners.\n\u201d However , the current push for a national \u201c contact tracing \u201d system based on citizens \u2019 private health data is likely to expand that data sharing , conveniently fitting with DARPA \u2019 s years-old goal of creating a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nProfusa is also backed by Google , which is intimately involved in these new mass surveillance \u201c contact tracing \u201d initiatives , and counts former Senate majority leader William Frist among its board members .\nThey are also partnered with the National Institutes of Health ( NIH ) The company also has considerable overlap with the diagnostic company Cepheid , which recently won FDA approval for its rapid coronavirus test and was previously awarded lucrative government contracts to detect anthrax in the U.S. postal system .\nAs of this past March , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if their injectable biosensors can predict future pandemics , including the now widely predicted \u201c second wave \u201d of Covid-19 , and detect those infected up to three weeks before they would otherwise show symptoms .\nThe company expects to have its biosensors FDA licensed for this purpose by early next year , about the same time a coronavirus vaccine is expected to be available to the general public .\nAnother long-standing DARPA program , now overseen by BTO , is known as \u201c Living Foundries.\n\u201d According to DARPA \u2019 s website @ @ @ @ @ @ @ adaptable , scalable , and on-demand production of [ synthetic ] molecules by programming the fundamental metabolic processes of biological systems to generate a vast number of complex molecules that are not otherwise accessible .\nThrough Living Foundries , DARPA is transforming synthetic biomanufacturing into a predictable engineering practice supportive of a broad range of national security objectives.\n\u201d The types of research this \u201c Living Foundries \u201d program supports involves the creation of \u201c artificial life \u201d including the creation of artificial genetic material , including artificial chromosomes , the creation of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ using artificial genetic material to \u201c add new capacities \u201d to human beings ( i.e .\ngenetically modifying humans through the insertion of synthetically-created genetic material ) .\nThe latter is of particular concern ( though all are honestly concerning ) , as DARPA also has a project called \u201c Advanced Tools for Mammalian Genome Engineering , \u201d which \u2013 despite having \u201c mammalian \u201d in the name \u2013 is focused specifically on improving \u201c the utility of Human Artificial Chromosomes ( HACs ) , \u201d which DARPA describes as a \u201c fundamental @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , vaccines , and cellular diagnostics.\n\u201d Though research papers often focus on HACs as a revolutionary medical advancement , they are also frequently promoted as a means of \u201c enhancing \u201d humans by imbuing them with non-natural characteristics , including halting aging or improving cognition .\nDARPA is known to be involved in research where these methods are used to create \u201c super soldiers \u201d that no longer require sleep or regular meals , among other augmented \u201c features , \u201d and has another program about creating \u201c metabolically dominant \u201d fighters @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the other , very disconcerting use of these same technologies , \u201c genetic weapons \u201d that would \u201c subvert DNA \u201d and \u201c undermine people \u2019 s minds and bodies.\n\u201d Another potential application being actively investigated by DARPA is its BioDesign program , which is examining the creation of synthetic organisms that are created to be immortal and programmed with a \u201c kill switch \u201d allowing a synthetic , yet organic organism to be \u201c turned off \u201d at any time .\nThis has led some to speculate such research could open @ @ @ @ @ @ @ human replicants \u201d used for fighting wars and other tasks , such as those that appear in the science fiction film Bladerunner .\nHowever , these genetic \u201c kill switches \u201d could also be inserted into actual humans through artificial chromosomes , which \u2013 just as they have the potential to extend life \u2013 also have the potential to cut it short .\nNotably , it was revealed in 2017 that DARPA had invested $ 100 million in \u201c gene drive \u201d research , which is involves the use of genetic modification to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it it often referred to as a \u201c genetic extinction \u201d technology .\nIn addition , other DARPA experiments involve the use of genetically modified viruses that insert genetic material into human cells , specifically neurons in the brain , in order to \u201c tweak \u201d human brain chemistry .\nIn one example , DARPA-funded research has altered human brain cells to produce two new proteins , the first allowing neural activity to be easily detected by external devices and the second allowing \u201c magnetic nanoparticles \u201d to \u201c induce an image or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u201d Changing human brain chemistry and functionality at the cellular level is only one of numerous DARPA initiatives aimed at changing how human beings think and perceive reality .\nSince 2002 , DARPA has acknowledged its efforts to create a \u201c Brain-Machine Interface ( BMI ) .\n\u201d Though first aimed at creating \u201c a wireless brain modem for a freely moving rat , \u201d which would allow the animal \u2019 s movements to be remotely controlled , DARPA wasn \u2019 t shy about the eventual goal of applying such brain \u201c enhancement @ @ @ @ @ @ @ soldiers to \u201c communicate by thought alone \u201d or remotely control human beings ( on the enemy side only , so they say ) for the purposes of war .\nThe project , which has advanced greatly in recent years , has long raised major concerns among prominent defense scientists , some of whom warned in a 2008 report that \u201c remote guidance or control of a human being \u201d could quickly backfire were an adversary to gain access to the implanted technology ( opening up the possibility of \u201c hacking \u201d a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they also raised concerns about the general ethical perils of such technologies .\nWork began in 2011 on developing \u201c brain implants \u201d for use in human soldiers , officially with the goal of treating neurological damage in veterans , and such implants have been tested on human volunteers in DARPA-funded experiments since at least 2015 .\nConcerns , like those raised by those defense scientists in 2008 , have been regularly dismissed by DARPA , which has consistently claimed that its controversial research projects are tempered by their in-house \u201c ethical experts.\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ DARPA \u2019 s leadership views these ethical conundrums , since they ultimately have the last word .\nFor example , in 2015 , Michael Goldblatt , then-director of DARPA \u2019 s Defense Sciences Office ( DSO ) , which oversees most aspects of the agency \u2019 s \u201c super soldier \u201d program , told journalist Annie Jacobsen that he saw no difference between \u201c having a chip in your brain that could help control your thoughts \u201d and \u201c a cochlear implant that helps the deaf hear.\n\u201d When pressed about the unintended @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that \u201c there are unintended consequences for everything.\n\u201d Thus , it is worth pointing out that , while DARPA-developed technologies \u2013 from human genetic engineering to the brain-machine interfaces \u2013 are often first promoted as something that will revolutionize and improve human health , DARPA sees the use of these technologies for such ends as being on the same footing as other dystopian and frankly nightmarish applications , like thought control .\nBMIs are no exception , having first been promoted as a way to \u201c boost bodily functions of veterans with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and to allow amputees to control advanced prosthetics .\nWhile these do indeed represent major medical advances , DARPA \u2019 s leadership has made it clear that they see no distinction between the medical use of BMIs and using them to exert near total control over a human being by \u201c guiding \u201d their thoughts and even their movements .\nSuch stark admission from DARPA \u2019 s leadership makes it worth exploring the state of these current \u201c brain-machine \u201d interface programs as well as their explicit goals .\nFor instance , one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Next-Generation Nonsurgical Neurotechnology ( N3 ) program involves using \u201c noninvasive or minimally invasive brain-computer interfaces \u201d to \u201c read and write \u201d directly onto the brain .\nAccording to one recent report on DARPA \u2019 s N3 program , one example of \u201c minimally invasive \u201d technologies would involve : Though the purported goal of N3 is related to creating \u201c thought-controlled \u201d weapons that react and fire based on a soldier \u2019 s thoughts , the fact that the technology is also bidirectional , opens up the disturbing possibility that efforts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a soldier \u2019 s thoughts and perceptions as opposed to the other way around .\nThis may be more of the plan than DARPA has publicly let on , since official military documents have openly stated that the Pentagon \u2019 s ultimate goal is to essentially replace human fighters with \u201c self-aware \u201d interconnected robots \u201c who \u201d will both design and conduct operations against targets chosen by artificial-intelligence systems .\nThis weapons system of the not-so-distant future seems to have little room for human beings , even those capable of \u201c controlling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that futurist military planners see soldiers with BMIs as a \u201c weapon \u201d that would also become connected to this same AI-driven system .\nIt is also worth pointing out that DARPA has been attempting to create an \u201c artificial human brain \u201d since 2013 .\nIn addition , reports on DARPA \u2019 s BMI efforts have suggested that this bidirectional technology will be used to \u201c cloud the perception of soldiers \u201d by \u201c distancing them from the emotional guilt of warfare , \u201d a move that would set a dangerous precedent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a marked jump in war crimes .\nOf course , these are just the admitted , potential \u201c military \u201d applications of such technology .\nOnce this technology moves from the military to the civilian sphere , as several DARPA inventions have in the past , their use for \u201c remote guidance \u201d , \u201c thought control \u201d and/or the programming of thoughts and experiences is more than likely to be misused by governments , corporations and other power-brokers in the U.S. and beyond for the purposes of control .\nThe entrance of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ t very far away , as DARPA executives and researchers who have worked on the N3 and other DARPA-backed BMI programs have since been \u201c scooped up \u201d by Verily ( a Google-GlaxoSmithKline partnership ) , Elon Musk \u2019 s Neuralink and Facebook \u2019 s Building 8 \u2013 all of which have been working to bring \u201c neuro-modulation \u201d devices and BMIs to market .\nAs detailed above , DARPA often frames the controversial technologies it develops as being developed to mainly advance medicine and healthcare .\nAside from the technologies already discussed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ DARPA has been very interested in healthcare , specifically vaccines , for some time .\nFor instance , in 2010 , DARPA began developing a class of vaccine that could \u201c inoculate against unknown pathogens , \u201d a component of its Accelerated Manufacture of Pharmaceuticals program .\nThe vaccine would inject thousands of synthetic antibodies , such as those developed through DARPA \u2019 s \u201c Living Foundries \u201d program , into the human body .\nThese synthetic antibodies or \u201c synbodies \u201d would then \u201c create an immunity toolkit that can be combined @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pathogen.\n\u201d That same year , DARPA began funding efforts to create \u201c multiagent synthetic DNA vaccines \u201d that would be delivered into the human body via \u201c noninvasive electroporation \u201d and was quickly promoted in media reports as a way to quickly produce vaccines compared to traditional vaccine production methods .\nThis category of vaccine would involve the same type of synthetic DNA that DARPA was also simultaneously researching for the purposes of both \u201c enhancing \u201d and \u201c subverting \u201d human beings at the genetic level .\nIt was also this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Melinda Gates Foundation also began heavily funding DNA and RNA vaccines .\nDNA vaccines , which were first created in 2005 , have never been approved for human use in the United States and past studies have warned that they \u201c possess significant unpredictability and a number of inherent harmful potential hazards \u201d and that \u201c there is inadequate knowledge to define either the probability of unintended events or the consequences of genetic modifications.\n\u201d Another longstanding issue with such vaccines is mitigating \u201c unwanted immune reactions \u201d that result from natural @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they contain .\nIn 2011 , DARPA announced its \u201c Rapidly Adaptable Nanotherapeutics \u201d program , which seeks to create a \u201c platform capable of rapidly synthesizing therapeutic nanoparticles \u201d aimed at combating \u201c evolving and even genetically engineered bioweapons.\n\u201d DARPA \u2019 s plan for these nanoparticles , which media reports described merely as \u201c tiny , autonomous drug delivery systems , \u201d was to combine them with \u201c small interfering RNA ( siRNA ) , \u201d which are snippets of RNA that can target and shut down specific genes .\nAs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ siRNA could be reprogrammed \u2018 on-the-fly \u2019 and applied to different pathogens , \u201d allowing nanoparticles to \u201c be loaded up with the right siRNA molecules and sent directly to cells responsible for the infection.\n\u201d The creation of this program was shortly followed by DARPA \u2019 s decision in 2013 to fund Moderna Therapeutics to the tune of $ 25 million to develop their synthetic RNA vaccine production platform .\nDARPA funded the project to \u201c develop platform technologies that can be deployed safely and rapidly to provide the U.S. population with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ engineered biological weapons.\n\u201d Then , in 2015 , DARPA \u2019 s research into vaccines involving synthetic antibodies and synthetic genetic material expanded , with them giving $ 45 million to the DNA vaccine company , Inovio Pharmaceuticals .\nThis same year , DARPA-funded RNA and DNA vaccines began to be framed differently by both DARPA researchers and the media \u2013 who described the technology as transforming the human body into a \u201c bio-reactor.\n\u201d In the years since , DARPA-backed DNA and RNA vaccine companies , including Moderna , Inovio as well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been unable to get their products licensed for human use , largely due to the fact that their vaccines have failed to provide sufficient immunity in human trials .\nExamples of these ineffective vaccines include CureVac \u2019 s attempt at a rabies vaccine and Moderna \u2019 s efforts to create a vaccine for the Zika virus ( which was funded by the U.S. government ) .\nSeveral workarounds for this issue have been proposed , including vaccines where the genetic material ( RNA or DNA ) \u201c self-amplifies.\n\u201d However , the workaround @ @ @ @ @ @ @ response and other obstacles for DNA/RNA vaccines is the incorporation of nanotechnology into these vaccines .\nAs a result , the use of nanoparticles as the carriers for the genetic material in these vaccines has been widely promoted and studied , as well as touted as the best way to improve their stability , increase their targeted delivery ability and enhance the immune response they provoke .\nThe combination of DNA or RNA vaccines with nanotechnology has already become reality thanks to the companies leading that field .\nFor instance , the DARPA-backed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reports refer to as \u201c DNA nanotechnology \u201d in their line of synthetic vaccines branded as \u201c SynCon \u201d by the company , which uses an undisclosed computer algorithm to design its vaccines .\nIt is an interesting coincidence , then , that the Inovio \u201c SynCon \u201d vaccine for Covid-19 now appears to be ahead of the rest of the pack , with backing from Bill Gates , DARPA , the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases ( NIAID ) and other government agencies .\nIn January , the Coalition for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it would begin funding vaccine candidates for the coronavirus outbreak , long before it became a major global issue .\nCEPI describes itself as \u201c a partnership of public , private , philanthropic and civil organizations that will finance and co-ordinate the development of vaccines against high priority public health threats \u201d and was founded in 2017 by the governments of Norway and India along with the World Economic Forum ( WEF ) and the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation .\nThat month , CEPI only chose two pharmaceutical companies to receive funding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for Covid-19 \u2013 Moderna and Inovio Pharmaceuticals .\nAs previously mentioned , these two companies are DARPA-backed firms that frequently tout their \u201c strategic alliance \u201d with DARPA in press releases and on their websites .\nDARPA has also provided these companies with significant amounts of funding .\nFor instance , the top funders behind Inovio Pharmaceuticals include both DARPA and the Pentagon \u2019 s Defense Threat Reduction Agency ( DTRA ) and the company has received millions in dollars in grants from DARPA , including a $ 45 million grant to develop @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also recently awarded over $ 8 million from the U.S. military to develop a small , portable intradermal device for delivering DNA vaccines , which was jointly developed by Inovio and the U.S. Army Medical Research Institute of Infectious Diseases ( USAMRIID ) , which also manages the \u201c biodefense \u201d lab at Fort Detrick .\nIn addition , the German company CureVac , which is also developing a CEPI-backed RNA vaccine for Covid-19 , is another long-time recipient of DARPA funding .\nThey were one of DARPA \u2019 s earliest investments in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ million DARPA contract to develop their \u201c RNActive \u201d vaccine platform in 2011 .\nIn Moderna \u2019 s case , DARPA financed the production and development of their RNA vaccine production platform and their RNA therapy candidate for Chikungunya virus ( their first for an infectious disease ) was developed in direct collaboration with the agency .\nSince 2016 , Moderna \u2019 s RNA vaccine program has received $ 100 million in funding from the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation .\nThe Gates Foundation has since poured millions directly into both Moderna \u2019 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ efforts .\nGates \u2019 backing of DNA and RNA vaccines is significant , given that Gates \u2013 a billionaire with unparalleled influence and control over global healthcare policy \u2013 recently asserted that the best options for a Covid-19 vaccine are these same vaccines , despite the fact that they have never before been approved for use in humans .\nYet , thanks to the emergency authorizations activated due to the current crisis , both Moderna \u2019 s and Inovio \u2019 s testing for these vaccines has skipped animal trials and gone straight to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be fast-tracked for widespread use in a matter of months .\nModerna \u2019 s clinical trial in humans began in mid-March , followed by Inovio \u2019 s in the beginning of April .\nThus , they are not only Gates \u2019 favorites to be the new vaccine , but are also slated to be the first to complete clinical trials and garner emergency U.S. government approval , especially Moderna \u2019 s vaccine which is being jointly developed with the government \u2019 s NIH .\nThe rapid rise to prominence of Moderna \u2019 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has resulted in several media articles praising DARPA as having provided our \u201c best hope \u201d for thwarting the coronavirus crisis .\nIn addition to its backing of Moderna \u2019 s and Inovio \u2019 s own efforts , DARPA itself , specifically DARPA \u2019 s BTO , is set to have a \u201c temporary \u201d vaccine for Covid-19 available in a matter of weeks that will involve the production of synthetic antibodies that would ostensibly provide immunity for a few months until a longer-lasting vaccine ( such as those produced by Moderna and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ s antibody treatment for Covid-19 is pursuing two routes , including the \u201c human body as bio-reactor \u201d approach that would involve synthetic DNA or RNA being injected in order to prompt the body to produce the necessary antibodies .\nDefense One notes that DARPA \u2019 s Covid-19 treatment would utilize techniques that had resulted from the agency \u2019 s investments in microfluidics ( the manipulation of liquids at the sub-millimeter range ) , nanotechnology fabrication and \u201c new approaches to gene sequencing.\n\u201d While most media reports have painted these DARPA-led efforts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ noting that concerns have been raised , though these concerns have hardly gotten the coverage they warrant .\nFor instance , Nature recently noted some key points regarding safety issues related to the race for a Covid-19 vaccine , including the fact that all \u201c previous coronavirus vaccines have not all proven appropriate or even safe , \u201d with some past attempts at coronavirus vaccines having resulted in antibody dependent enhancement ( ADE ) .\nADE results in cells more rapidly taking up the virus and speeding up the virus \u2019 replication , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also noted that the two coronavirus vaccines for SARS that managed to pass phase 1 trials ended up , in subsequent studies , causing immune hypersensitivity in mice \u201c resulting in severe immunopathology , \u201d i.e .\npermanent defects or malfunctions in the immune system .\nIn addition , Nature also pointed out that it is unknown how strong an immune response is needed to confer immunity for Covid-19 and coronaviruses in general , making it incredibly difficult to gauge if a vaccine is even effective .\nAnother issue worth noting involves concerns @ @ @ @ @ @ @ firm Citron Research , which compared Inovio to Theranos , the disgraced medical technology company that had initially promised to offer diagnoses for numerous diseases via a simple blood test , but was later revealed to be a sham .\nCitron asserted that \u201c It \u2019 s been over 40 years since Inovio was founded , yet the company has NEVER [ sic ] brought a product to market , and all the while insiders have enriched themselves with hefty salaries and large stock sales.\n\u201d Citron Research went on to say that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ designed their Covid-19 vaccine in only 3 hours based on a computer algorithm was hard to believe , stating that \u201c Inovio has a \u2018 computer algorithm \u2019 that no one else in the world has and is arguably one of the greatest breakthroughs in vaccine discovery in the past 100 years , and yet this \u2018 computer algorithm \u2019 is not mentioned once in any of its 10-K \u2019 s or 10-Q \u2019 s ?\nSounds like Theranos to us.\n\u201d It also noted that Inovio \u2019 s partnerships with pharmaceutical companies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those two companies canceling the partnership despite claims from Inovio \u2019 s CEO that whey would \u201c continue to thrive.\n\u201d Of course , these are just concerns focused on corporate behavior and obstacles towards making a Covid-19 vaccine in general .\nAs this report has already shown in detail , DARPA \u2019 s other experiments with the same technologies ( particularly genetic engineering , synthetic chromosomes , and nanotechnology ) that are being used to produce RNA and DNA vaccines for Covid-19 are arguably more concerning .\nThis is especially true given @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u201c strategic partners \u201d of the agency are those manufacturing these vaccines .\nIn addition , thanks to backing from the U.S. government and Bill Gate , among others , they are are also slated to be among the first vaccines ( if not the first ) approved for widespread use .\nIt is certainly troubling that media coverage of DARPA \u2019 s efforts and the efforts of Moderna and Inovio have thus far not included critical reporting regarding the different branches of DARPA \u2019 s research that has produced the technology involved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ room for public scrutiny of their safety , efficacy and their potential for unintended effects on human genetics .\nThis is particularly alarming given that , over the past several weeks , efforts have been taking shape in many countries to enforce mandatory vaccinations once a Covid-19 vaccine becomes available .\nIn some countries , it appears likely that the Covid-19 vaccine will not be made mandatory per say , but will be required for those who wish to return to any semblance of \u201c normalcy \u201d in terms of public gatherings , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ s home for longer periods of time and so on .\nWould those involved in creating such a mandatory vaccine , e.g .\nDARPA , pass up the opportunity to utilize the same technologies involved in producing the vaccine for some of their other admitted goals ?\nThis question , of course , has no obvious answer , but the fact that the arc of DARPA \u2019 s research is aimed at the weaponization of human biology and genetics in a way that is ripe for misuse , suggests very worrying possibilities that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ merely looks at how the crisis has been a boon for the Orwellian plans of the National Security Commission on Artificial Intelligence ( NSCAI ) and the federal government \u2019 s current efforts to dramatically increase its powers amid the current crisis , it becomes increasingly difficult to give government agencies like DARPA and their corporate partners like Moderna and Inovio the benefit of the doubt .\nThis is especially true given that \u2013 without a major crisis such as that currently dominating world events \u2013 people would likely be unreceptive to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ DARPA has been developing , whether their push to create cyborg \u201c super soldiers \u201d or injectable BMIs with the capability to control one \u2019 s thoughts .\nYet , amid the current crisis , many of these same technologies are being sold to the public as \u201c healthcare , \u201d a tactic DARPA often uses .\nAs the panic and fear regarding the virus continues to build and as people become increasingly desperate to return to any semblance of normalcy , millions will willingly take a vaccine , regardless of any government-mandated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and desperate will not care that the vaccine may include nanotechnology or have the potential to genetically modify and re-program their very being , as they will only want the current crisis that has upended the world to stop .\nIn this context , the current coronavirus crisis appears to be the perfect storm that will allow DARPA \u2019 s dystopian vision to take hold and burst forth from the darkest recesses of the Pentagon into full public view .\nHowever , DARPA \u2019 s transhumanist vision for the military and for humanity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to human freedom , but an existential threat to human existence and the building blocks of biology itself .\nQuestion Everything , Come To Your Own Conclusions .\nAlso See : Bill Gates Partners With DARPA & Department of Defense For New DNA Nanotech COVID19 Vaccine !\nSubscribe to Activist Post for

with Physical and Emotional Safety", "date": "2020-05-06", "source": "activistpost", "title": "Bubble-Wrapped Americans: How the U.S. Became Obsessed with Physical and Emotional Safety", "content": "It \u2019 s a common refrain : We have bubble-wrapped the world .\nAmericans in particular are obsessed with \u201c safety.\n\u201d The simplest way to get any law passed in America , be it a zoning law or a sweeping reform of the intelligence community , is to invoke a simple sentence : \u201c A kid might get hurt.\n\u201d Almost no one is opposed to reasonable efforts at making the world a safer place .\nBut the operating word here is \u201c reasonable.\n\u201d Banning lawn darts , for example , rather than just telling people that they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ children , is a perfect example of a craving for safety gone too far .\nBeyond the realm of legislation , this has begun to infect our very culture .\nThink of things like \u201c trigger warnings \u201d and \u201c safe spaces.\n\u201d These are part of broader cultural trends in search of a kind of \u201c emotional safety \u201d \u2013 a purported right to never be disturbed or offended by anything .\nThis is by no means confined to the sphere of academia , but is also in our popular culture , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more mainstream variants .\nWhy are Americans so obsessed with safety ?\nWhat is the endgame of those who would bubble wrap the world , both physically and emotionally ?\nPerhaps most importantly , what can we do to turn back the tide and reclaim our culture of self-reliance , mental toughness , and giving one another the benefit of the doubt so that we don \u2019 t \u201c bankrupt ourselves in the vain search for absolute security , \u201d as President Dwight D. Eisenhower warned us about ?\nCoddling and Splintering : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ books published in 2018 provide parallel insights into the problems presented by the safety obsession of American culture : The Splintering of the American Mind by William Egginton , focused on the tendency of Americans to tunnel themselves off into self-selected bubbles , and The Coddling of the American Mind by Greg Lukianoff and Jonathan Haidt , which deals more with the tendency to avoid any uncomfortable or unpleasant information .\nThere is an interesting phenomenon involved in coddling : Australian psychologist Nick Haskam first coined the term \u201c concept creep.\n\u201d Basically @ @ @ @ @ @ @ elastic and expand past the point of meaning .\nTake , for example , the concept of \u201c trauma.\n\u201d This used to have a very limited meaning .\nHowever , \u201c trauma \u201d quickly became expanded to mean even slight physical or emotional harm or discomfort .\nThus the increasing belief among the far left that words can be \u201c violence \u201d \u2013 not \u201c violent , \u201d mind you , but actual , literal violence .\nIn the other direction , the definition of \u201c hero \u201d has been expanded to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , firefighter and police officer is now considered a \u201c hero.\n\u201d This isn \u2019 t to downplay or minimize the importance of these roles in our society .\nIt \u2019 s simply to point out that \u201c hero \u201d just doesn \u2019 t mean what it used to 100 or even 30 years ago .\nOnce this expansion of a term occurs , there is never any kind of retraction .\nTrauma now means just about anything , and violence will soon be expanded to include lawful , peaceful speech that one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there will be no going back .\nIn the words of Sam Harris : It is extremely dangerous to begin labelling everything as violence for reasons of free speech , but perhaps even more dangerous is the notion that when anything is violence , nothing is violence .\nRedefining words as \u201c violence \u201d means that we have little recourse for when actual violence occurs .\nThe Coddling of the American Mind notes some other concepts that are important as we speak of America \u2019 s obsession with \u201c safety \u201d above all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with splintering means that people \u2019 s political views are much more like fanatical religious views than anything .\nThey don \u2019 t see themselves as having to debate ideas or seek common ground .\nRather , the opposing side and its proponents are seen as \u201c dangerous \u201d and must be discredited at all costs .\nIt is worth noting that this is much more common among the left than the right or the center , which has now become more the place where \u201c live and let live \u201d types congregate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ simply being irritated by irrational people barking at you or at someone else : There is an entire generation of people who are seriously lacking in critical thinking skills .\nThey think that labelling people and name-calling are excuses for a reasoned argument .\nIn the words of Voltaire , \u201c Those who can make you believe absurdities can make you commit atrocities.\n\u201d These problems are hardly confined to political radicalism or academia .\nIndeed , the corporate sector is no stranger to this kind of safety obsession .\nThere is the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where the corporations find the latest celebrity cause-du-jour and use it as a marketing strategy .\nThere is currently an extreme risk aversion in management science .\nCompanies will now do basically anything to avoid \u201c a kid getting hurt \u201d or someone \u2019 s delicate sensibilities being offended .\nEducation from kindergarten up to the universities is increasingly about teaching doctrines and ideology , rather than critical thinking and problem solving skills .\nAll of this is a dangerous admixture that combines the full weight of the academic , cultural and business @ @ @ @ @ @ @ consequences are far reaching .\nFor those unaware , a \u201c trigger warning \u201d is a person \u2019 s advisory that disturbing content is going to be posted .\nHowever , in an example of concept creep , the meaning of \u201c disturbing \u201d has become expanded to mean , well , just about anything that might offend a leftist .\nIt is also sometimes known as a \u201c content warning , \u201d \u201c TW \u201d or \u201c CW.\n\u201d A similar concept is that of a \u201c safe space.\n\u201d What used @ @ @ @ @ @ @ place where people in actual danger of physical harm could express themselves , a \u201c safe space \u201d now means a place where there is no room for disagreement or questions because language is literally violence .\nThis might all sound very silly and we definitely agree that it is .\nHowever , it is quickly becoming de rigeur not just in academia , which is increasingly functioning as a bizarre combination of a daycare center for 21 year olds and an indoctrination program , but also in the corporate world and in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ surprising that such foolishness has reached our corporate elites , because so many figures within that world come from the Ivy League .\nHarvard Law , for example , was the center of a controversy where they were urged not to teach rape law or even use the word \u201c violate \u201d ( which makes it pretty hard to talk about violations of the law ) .\nA Harvard professor argued that greater anxiety among students to discuss complicated and nuanced sexual assault cases was impeding the ability of professors to adequately teach @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lead to poorly prepared attorneys for rape victims in the future .\nBeyond a simple discussion in the academic sphere , there are student groups on campus who urge students not to attend or participate in class discussions focused on sexual violence .\nThe same student groups advocate for warning students in advance so they can skip out on class and even to exclude \u201c triggering \u201d material from tests .\nOnce again , the real victims here are the victims of sexual assault whose attorneys will be ill-prepared to advise them , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the prosecutorial environment .\nNorthwestern University professor Laura Kipnis was subject to a lengthy investigation by a kangaroo court and frivolous Title IX complaints over an article she wrote for The Chronicle of Higher Education about campus sex panics .\nTop comedians like Chris Rock now refuse to perform on college campuses , a place that has typically been their bread and butter .\nAnother key term to understand here is \u201c microaggressions \u201d which means just about anything .\nOffensive statements under this umbrella include things like \u201c I don \u2019 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is the land of opportunity \u201d and \u201c I believe the most qualified person should get the job.\n\u201d To readers of Generation X or older , this all might sound like a resurgence of political correctness and , indeed , to some extent it is .\nHowever , there is something different about the current anti-speech craze sweeping not just campuses , but also boardrooms : Political correctness was , at least in theory , about the elimination of so-called \u201c hate speech \u201d ( for example , using \u201c mentally disabled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u201c little person \u201d instead of \u201c midget \u201d ) and also about broadening the canon of literature to include more women and minorities .\nOne doesn \u2019 t need to agree with either objective or be as generous as we are to see that the West has entered a new , accelerated and intensified version of the old political correctness that is qualitatively more dangerous .\nThe \u201c safe spaces \u201d phase of this is about eliminating anything and everything that might be emotionally troubling to students on campus .\nThis assumes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ college students .\nBut perhaps this assumption isn \u2019 t totally off base .\nIf you were born before 1985 or so , your childhood was vastly different than of those born after you .\nAs a child , you probably came and went as you pleased , letting your parents know where you were going , who you would be with and when you might be home .\nYou rode your bike without a helmet and if you were bullied at school there \u2019 s a good chance that you view this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of deep emotional trauma .\nA few things .\nFirst , in 1984 , the \u201c missing child \u201d milk carton was introduced .\nAmerica became obsessed with child abduction in response to several high-profile child kidnappings over the period of a few years .\nEtan Platz , Adam Walsh and Johnny Gosch are just three of the names known to Americans during this time period .\nIn September 1984 , the Des Moines , Iowa-based Anderson Erickson Dairy began printing the pictures of Johnny Gosch and Eugene Martin on milk cartons .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ state of California .\nIn December 1984 , a nationwide program was launched to keep the faces of abducted children front and center in the American mind .\nThe milk cartons didn \u2019 t find many kids , but they did create the panic of \u201c stranger danger , \u201d where children were taught to fear strangers even though the lion \u2019 s share of child abduction , molestation and abuse comes from friends , family and other trusted figures such as public school teachers or camp counselors .\nMost missing children in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of all child abductions , the perpetrator is a non-custodial father .\nThere is at least one case of \u201c stranger danger \u201d being harmful \u2013 a lost 11-year-old Boy Scout who thought his rescuers were looking to kidnap him .\nSome of the protocols established out of this were useful , such as AMBER Alerts and Code Adam .\nAwareness of child abduction in general was raised and as a result there \u2019 s significantly fewer child abductions today than there were in 1980 .\nIndeed , stranger abduction is incredibly rare @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has come with a dark side .\nYou might be familiar with the myriad of cases in suburban America where children playing alone are arrested by the police because they don \u2019 t have adult supervision .\nThe parents are then questioned by the police or , in some cases , the state \u2019 s Child Protective Services .\nThere was also the panic after the mass shooting at Columbine High School , which led to the bubble wrapping of schools alongside the home .\n\u201c Zero tolerance \u201d policies were implemented alongside @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the result is that there are at least two generations of American children raised in a protective net so tight that they not only have trouble expressing themselves , but also being exposed to failure and discomfort .\nWhat began as a good-faith effort to prevent child abduction and increase overall child welfare has ended up , as a side effect , creating a world where children were raised in such safety that they can \u2019 t even handle being upset .\nThis has not only insulated children from the consequences of their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ growing up , but also gives the impression that no matter what their problems , \u201c adults \u201d are ready to step in and save the day at any moment .\nIt \u2019 s worth noting that , in recent years , there has been a sharp rise in mental illness among young people , both on campus and off , including those with severe mental health problems .\nThere are two other cultural phenomena worth exploring : The television series Cops and the 24-hour cable news cycle .\nAs of April 2020 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , having moved from Fox to Spike TV in 2013 .\nCops was more than just a TV series , it was a cultural phenomenon that changed television .\nThe cin\u00e9ma v\u00e9rit\u00e9 style used by the show was to be copied in the \u2019 90s by virtually every reality show you can name .\nCuriously , it came out around the same time that crime rates had plummeted comparatively to the \u2019 70s and 80s .\nAnd just at that time , people started having the worst in human behavior beamed into their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ At the same time , CNN was bringing news into your home 24 hours a day without end .\nThis meant they had to fill programming around the clock \u2013 and most news is bad news .\nSo in addition to a hugely popular program centered around chasing criminals in the act , Americans also had a constant stream of bad news and dangerous events pumped into their homes .\nThe result was the end of the \u201c free range child , \u201d the kind who learned through play and discovered risk management @ @ @ @ @ @ @ replaced with children whose entire existence was micromanaged by adults , with little to no unsupervised play time .\nThe ability to learn through failure is a well-established principle going back to the Greeks , who called it pathemata mathemata ( \u201c guide your learning through pain \u201d ) .\nThe knowledge and wisdom gained through failure and pain are arguably more lasting and valuable than those learned in school .\nOlder generations ( Generation X and Baby Boomers ) have a tendency to conflate Millennials and Gen Z ( also known as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there are two key differences , one cultural and one clinical : First , Zoomers are much more digital natives than their Millennial counterparts .\nThey didn \u2019 t get constant internet access or mobile access at college .\nThey \u2019 ve had it since they were in middle school in many cases .\nWhile this is bound to create secondary cultural differences , we know of one clinical difference between Millennials and Zoomers : Zoomers are much more prone to mental illness , specifically depression , anxiety , alcoholism and self-harm .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ the roof for girls , with moderate increases for boys .\nWhile self-reported cases are up , we also have harder clinical data : There has been a 62 percent increase in hospital admissions .\nThe Baby Boomers and Gen Xers created an environment where it is safer than ever to be a child , but at what cost ?\nThere has been widespread and verifiable psychological damage done to the younger generation , which is likely being compounded by the coddling taking place in our nation \u2019 s universities .\n\u201c Screen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ parents , especially among , ironically , those who work in high-tech Silicon Valley jobs such as Steve Jobs , father of the iPhone .\nBut there seems to be an emerging consensus among those who have actually studied the topic that the problem isn \u2019 t \u201c screen time \u201d per se , but rather the more specific use of it in the form of social media .\nThis has been identified as the cause of depression and anxiety , particularly among girls .\nWhy is social media usage particularly impactful among @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that it \u2019 s because they are more sensitive to the \u201c perfect \u201d lives being lived by beautiful social media influencers \u2013 at least the lives that they lead online .\nWhat \u2019 s more , there is a lot of exclusion and bullying taking place on social media .\nIn days past , you only heard about the party you didn \u2019 t get invited to , but now you get to watch it unfold in real time on Snapchat or other platforms .\nAnd cyberbullying is much harder to track @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nThere \u2019 s a related bubble wrapping going on with regard to a different sort of screen time : Kids today are often forbidden from playing with plastic guns or even finger guns .\nThere is the notorious case of the 7-year-old child who was suspended for biting a Pop Tart toaster pastry into the shape of a gun .\nBut millions of children come home ( from the same schools where finger guns can warrant a suspension ) to play Grand Theft Auto for hours on end .\nIndeed , there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ movies and video games can trigger violent thoughts in some , but not all , people who view them .\nThe National Institute of Mental Health has done an extensive study detailing the impact that violent media has on those who view it .\nThere \u2019 s not much hyperbole in saying that America is barely a single nation anymore .\nWe talk about \u201c red states \u201d and \u201c blue states , \u201d but the divide is much deeper than that .\nEven the coastal states largely have an urban college-educated Democratic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nWhile some animosity between different areas of the political spectrum , or even resentment of cities by the countryside and vice versa , is nothing new , the rancor took off sharply in the early 2000s following the controversial election of George W. Bush and his expanded imperial presidency after 9/11 .\nSocial media makes it easier for extremes to amplify their anger .\nWhat \u2019 s more , it \u2019 s much easier for people to become part of an online crusade \u2013 or witch hunt \u2013 than it is for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This is a big part of what is behind the string of disinvitations and protests on American college campuses .\nNo one , especially young people ( where \u201c young \u201d means \u201c under 30 \u201d ) , can bear to listen to the opinions of someone they don \u2019 t agree with .\nDisinvitations aren \u2019 t limited to highly controversial figures like MILO and Richard Spencer , or even the decidedly much more vanilla Ann Coulter .\nCondoleezza Rice , the first black female Secretary of State , was disinvited in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ head of the IMF and the first female finance minister of a G8 nation , Christine Lagarde .\nBecause Americans increasingly refuse even to listen to arguments from the other side , inserting instead a strawman in favor of reasoned debate , there is no reason to believe that the American political and ideological divide will not increase .\nAmerica and the West have largely adopted a victimhood culture .\nIt is worth taking a minute to trace this radical transformation of values in the West from its origins .\nThe earliest societies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ While it sounds like a no-brainer that we should return to an honor culture , we should unpack precisely what this means .\nAn honor culture usually means a lot of interpersonal violence .\nSmall slights must be dealt with through dead violence \u2013 because a gentleman can not take any kind of stain on his honor .\nDueling and blood feuds are common in these kinds of cultures .\nThis is superseded by dignity culture .\nDignity culture is different , because people are presumed to have dignity regardless of what others @ @ @ @ @ @ @ culture , people are admired because they have a \u201c thick skin \u201d and are able to brush off slights even if they are seriously insulting .\nWhile we might find ourselves offended , even rightfully so , it is considered important to rise above the offense and conduct ourselves with dignity .\nEveryone heard some variant of \u201c sticks and stones may break my bones but words will never hurt me \u201d growing up as a child .\nThis is perhaps the key phrase of a dignity culture .\nVictimhood culture is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to honor culture .\nIndeed , people become incredibly intolerant of any kind of perceived slight , much in the manner of an honor culture .\nHowever , in a victimhood culture , it is being offended , taking offense , and being a victim that provides one with status .\nVictimhood culture means that people are divided into classes , where victims are good and oppressors are bad .\nThere is an eternal conflict with eternal grievances that can never fully be corrected or atoned for .\nPeople feel the need to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nThis leads to an overall emphasis on safety , as even words become \u201c violence \u201d \u2013 we need trigger warnings and safe spaces to protect us .\nVictimhood culture is closely associated with safety culture .\nSafety culture is , above all else , debilitating .\nThose who choose a marginalized identity \u2013 and in the contemporary West , a marginalized identity is almost always a choice \u2013 become more fragile and more dependent on the broader society .\nAt the same time , the powerful elements in society gain a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The Great Society provides a case study in this dynamic .\nThose who do not receive the so-called \u201c benefits \u201d of safety culture are frequently more prepared for the real world .\nWho would you rather hire ?\nSomeone who studied hard in a rigorous discipline for four years or someone who spent four years being coddled in what is basically a day care center for twentysomethings ?\nWith this in mind , it \u2019 s not too big of a leap to see that straight white men might actually have become @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not having access to the collective hugbox in higher education .\nThe Role of Lawyers and Litigation There is a relationship with the litigious society in which we live with warning labels everywhere , often for hazards that would seem incredibly obvious to most observant people .\nIn previous generations , even power tools didn \u2019 t come with warnings to roll your sleeves up or take off your watch .\nThis information was either common sense or passed along in high school shop classes or on the job .\nHowever , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ frivolous lawsuits , which has led to an explosion in the number of lawsuits .\nThere is a massive army of lawyers in the United States ( which has a surplus of some 40 percent ) whose profession revolves around finding aggrieved parties who weren \u2019 t properly \u201c warned \u201d \u2013 or indeed to be able to help write the warning labels themselves .\nThese labels do not even exist for actual safety .\nThe same type of person who is going to do the thing being warned against is likely the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ t read warnings .\nThe labels are simply there as a form of \u201c CYA \u201d for the firms who make them .\nThat said , to a certain degree , the \u201c litigious society \u201d is a myth .\nThe oft-cited McDonald \u2019 s coffee burn is actually more reasonable than people are aware : The elderly woman in question who was burned simply wanted McDonald \u2019 s \u2013 who kept their coffee extra hot to prevent people from taking part of their \u201c free refills \u201d policy \u2013 to pay for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nWhen McDonald \u2019 s refused to settle this out of court and the case went to trial , they were rewarded for their efforts at stonewalling with punitive damages .\nSo the main example of frivolous lawsuits is a big strawman .\nBut to be clear \u2013 frivolous lawsuits are real .\nOne great example of an actually frivolous lawsuit was the man who sued his dry cleaner for $ 67 million because they delivered his pants to the wrong person .\nThere was no actual damage here and it \u2019 s @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dollar figure claimed was .\nThis case was thrown out of court , as most of these types of cases are .\nStill , litigants pursue them either to get media attention or to harass the defendant or both , a phenomenon known as \u201c lawfare.\n\u201d And these cases clog up genuine claims in the courts .\nCivil trials are long and drawn-out things .\nAnd with 40 million of them in the United States every year and over a million lawyers , it \u2019 s unsurprising that the system has become @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are either totally frivolous ( remember \u2013 there \u2019 s no penalty for filing a frivolous lawsuit in America ) or just the type of thing that should be either settled or handled through binding arbitration .\nWhile the litigious society exists in parallel to the \u201c safe spaces \u201d of college campuses , it is worth noting because it is part of the larger bubble wrapping of the American landscape .\nThe same kids who were raised with helicopter parents and a general sense that they had a \u201c right \u201d to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an environment where people could be sued for anything or , at the very least , this was the public perception .\nIt is just another factor of risk aversion in American life .\nThere are other consequences of having too many lawyers around and having them congregate within our political class : Words are chosen to obfuscate and laws proliferate , as legislation becomes a sort of \u201c jobs program \u201d for lawyers .\nThe more laws we have , the less free we are and the less social trust we have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ agencies take the place of civil society , the state grows at the expense of everything else and the less trust we have in our society .\nIn 2020 , the Wuhan Coronavirus broke out of China and spread all around the world .\nThe world had not seen a deadly , contagious virus with such scope since the Spanish flu pandemic of 1918 to 1920 .\nAt first , the response was denial and apathy .\nHowever , this quickly gave way to what could be considered a massive overreaction : Shutting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ logic to this : If people gathering together were what was spreading the virus , then simply keep people apart until the whole thing blows over .\nHowever , this is also potentially a huge overreaction .\nIt is a medical solution in the driver \u2019 s seat without any nod to the economic , social or military consequences that flow from it .\nEven if one agrees that medical solutions are to be the primary driver , it does not follow that they are the only driver .\nBecause of the lopsided @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the proposed solutions don \u2019 t even make sense : For example , telling everyone they can go to the supermarket while prohibiting them from going to small offices , or shutting down the border between the United States and Canada \u2013 two countries with highly infected populations and a sprawling border that is largely unpatrolled .\nA brief disclaimer : None of us are epidemiologists or virologists .\nAnd we defer to their superior knowledge on this subject .\nHowever , during the Spanish flu pandemic , life did not shut down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Coronavirus pandemic .\nThe methods used during the Spanish flu were isolation of the sick , mask wearing in public , and cancellation of large events .\nIn places where these were practiced rigorously , there was a significant decline in the number of infections and death .\nSt. Louis in particular is known as an exemplar of what to do during an easily transmissible epidemic .\n\u201c The economy \u201d has been cited as a reason the total shutdown of life during the Coronavirus pandemic was a poor idea .\nThis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unemployment not only leads to destitution for those when the economy is so paralyzed that there are no other jobs forthcoming .\nIt also leads to a spike in the suicide rate .\nThere is a certain calculus that must be done \u2013 how much unemployment is worth how much death from Wuhan Coronavirus ?\nThe reaction to this virus is noteworthy , because it is the first major pandemic of this new , insulated and coddled age .\nRather than reasonable measures to mitigate death , the choice made was to do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ entirely .\nNot only might this be an unwise decision , it might be a fool \u2019 s errand : The virus seems to be much more contagious than was previously thought , as well as much less lethal .\nMore than one reasonable person has asked what would happen if we all just went about our lives making reasonable precautions , such as hand washing , mask wearing , social distancing , and the cancellation of large events like sports and concerts .\nThis is effectively what Sweden has done and it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with their neighbors in Finland who have done basically the same as America .\nHow much sense does it make to have the entire community converge upon its grocery stores while not allowing anyone to go into an office , ever ?\nCompare this with what has passed for reasonable reaction : Closing down every school , every dine-in restaurant , and the government dictating which businesses are essential and which aren \u2019 t .\nA big motivator of this is a compulsion to not lose a single life to the Wuhan Coronavirus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nPeople are going to die .\nThe question isn \u2019 t \u201c how tightly do we have to lock the country down to ensure no one dies , \u201d but rather \u201c what are reasonable measures we can take to balance public safety against personal choice and social cohesion ?\n\u201d The splintering and division of America in practice has meant that the establishment conservative media was largely in denial over the virus for weeks .\nIt is not a liberal smear to say that the amount of denialism from establishment conservative @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bureaucrats and elected officials has in practice meant that America responded much more slowly and conservatively than it might have with a more unified America body politic .\nAt the beginning of spring 2020 , the virus seemed poised to devastate the American South , which largely stuck with the early conservative media denialism , eschewing social distancing , shuttering of certain public places and mask wearing .\nAgain , a more united body politic and the media and trust in the media that goes along with that might have prevented a lot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ impact of Walter Cronkite or Edward Murrow going on television and telling the American public to mask up and maintain distance versus the impact of Rachel Maddow and Tucker Carlson doing it .\n\u201c Vindictive protectiveness \u201d was a term coined by Haidt and Lukianoff to describe the environment on America \u2019 s college campuses with regard to speech codes and similar .\nHowever , it can refer more broadly to the cultural atmosphere in the United States and the West today .\nFrom the college campus to the corporate boardroom to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they say and maybe even what they think lest they fall afoul of extra-legal speech and thought codes .\nPerhaps worst of all , an entire generation is being raised to see this not only as normal , but as beneficial .\nThis means that as this generation comes of age and grows into leadership positions , that there is a significant chance that these codes will be enforced more rigorously , not less .\nAnd while there may be ebbs and flows ( political correctness went into hibernation for pretty much the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ though to be fair , there was an imperfect replacement in the form of post-9/11 jingoism ) , the current outrage factory is much more concerning than the one that sort of just hung around in the background in the 1990s .\nPut plainly : the next wave will be worse .\nWe may not have Maoist-style Red Guards in America quite yet , but we \u2019 re not far off and the emphasis should be on \u201c yet.\n\u201d Subscribe to Activist Post for truth , peace , and freedom news .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ little as $ 1 per month at Patreon .\nFollow us on SoMee , HIVE ,

permitted the wholesale spying on American citizens .\nHR 6172 , if passed into law , will give the FBI the powers to continue to spy , surveil and watchlist ordinary Americans .\nIn addition to new

provision that permits the government to get orders targeting people who frequently change @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to avoid traditional wiretaps on individual lines .\nAnd of mounting concern to a growing number of watchlisted Americans , including reporters and activists , is the \u201c lone wolf \u201d provision which grants the government the power to surveil people who have no known connection to terrorist organizations but are nonetheless suspected for unspecified reasons of some level of terrorism .\nThis provision is also up for the Senate vote .\nA number of amendments to the Bill , which

Maryland Law Bans Warrantless Stingray Spying; Hinders Federal Surveillance Program", "content": "ANNAPOLIS , Md .\n( May 8 , 2020 ) \u2013 Yesterday , Maryland Gov .\nLawrence Hogan announced he would allow a bill to ban the use of \u201c stingrays \u201d to track the location of phones without a warrant and prohibit police from sweeping up electronic communications to go into law without his signature .\nDel .\nDavid Moon ( D ) , along with three fellow Democrats , introduced House Bill 499 ( HB499 ) on Jan. 24 .\nSen. Charles Sydnor ( D-Baltimore ) sponsored the companion , Senate Bill 246 ( SB246 ) .\nThe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cell-site simulators , known as \u201c stingrays.\n\u201d These devices essentially spoof cell phone towers , tricking any device within range into connecting to the stingray instead of the tower .\nThis allows law enforcement to sweep up communications content , as well as locate and track the person in possession of a specific phone or other electronic device .\nThe new law adds provisions to existing Maryland statutes limiting warrantless location tracking through electronic devices to address the use of cell-site simulators .\nUnder the law , police will be required to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cause before deploying a stingray device .\nThe law also bars police from using a stingray to obtain communication content and spells out explicit criteria law enforcement must meet in order to justify such an order .\nOn Feb. 27 , the House passed HB499 by a 132-4 vote .\nThe Senate concurred with a unanimous vote of 45-0 .\nThe law will go into effect on Oct. 1 , 2020 .\nThe new law includes limitations on the use of stingrays even with a court order .\nThese restrictions require police to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or non-target data without a further court order .\nThe law requires the deletion of any incidentally gathered information on persons not named in the court order immediately upon the expiration of the order .\nInformation gathered in violation of the law will be subject to the exclusionary rule as judicially determined .\nInformation gathered on non-targeted devices would not be admissible in court under any circumstances .\nThe law will not only protect privacy in Maryland , but it will also hinder one aspect of the federal surveillance state .\nThe federal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and local stingray programs , attaching one important condition .\nThe feds require agencies acquiring the technology to sign non-disclosure agreements .\nThis throws a giant shroud over the program , even preventing judges , prosecutors and defense attorneys from getting information about the use of stingrays in court .\nThe feds actually instruct prosecutors to withdraw evidence if judges or legislators press for information .\nAs the Baltimore Sun reported in April 2015 , a Baltimore detective refused to answer questions on the stand during a trial , citing a federal non-disclosure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you to withhold evidence from the state \u2019 s attorney and Circuit Court , even upon court order to produce ?\n\u201d he asked .\nAs privacysos.org put it , \u201c The FBI would rather police officers and prosecutors let \u2018 criminals \u2019 go than face a possible scenario where a defendant brings a Fourth Amendment challenge to warrantless stingray spying.\n\u201d The experience of a Pinellas County , Florida , man further highlights the shroud of secrecy around the use of stingray devices , along with the potential for abuse of power @ @ @ @ @ @ @ community .\nThe feds sell the technology in the name of \u201c anti-terrorism \u201d efforts .\nWith non-disclosure agreements in place , most police departments refuse to release any information on the use of stingrays .\nBut information obtained from the Tacoma Police Department revealed that it uses the technology primarily for routine criminal investigations .\nSome privacy advocates argue that stingray use can never happen within the parameters of the Fourth Amendment because the technology necessarily connects to every electronic device within range , not just the one held by the target @ @ @ @ @ @ @ devices undoubtedly ends up in federal databases .\nThe feds can share and tap into vast amounts of information gathered at the state and local level through fusion centers and a system known as the \u201c information sharing environment \u201d or ISE .\nIn other words , stingrays create the potential for the federal government to track the movement of millions of Americans with no warrant , no probable cause , and without the people even knowing it .\nFusion centers were sold as a tool to combat terrorism , but that is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The ACLU pointed to a bipartisan congressional report to demonstrate the true nature of government fusion centers : \u201c They haven \u2019 t contributed anything meaningful to counterterrorism efforts .\nInstead , they have largely served as police surveillance and information sharing nodes for law enforcement efforts targeting the frequent subjects of police attention : Black and brown people , immigrants , dissidents , and the poor.\n\u201d Fusion centers operate within the broader ISE .\nAccording to its website , the ISE \u201c provides analysts , operators , and investigators with information @ @ @ @ @ @ @ analysts , operators , and investigators\u2026have mission needs to collaborate and share information with each other and with private sector partners and our foreign allies.\n\u201d In other words , ISE serves as a conduit for the sharing of information gathered without a warrant .\nKnown ISE partners include the Office of Director of National Intelligence which oversees 17 federal agencies and organizations , including the NSA .\nISE utilizes these partnerships to collect and share data on the millions of unwitting people they track .\nThe federal government encourages and funds stingrays @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the U.S. , thereby undoubtedly gaining access to a massive data pool on Americans without having to expend the resources to collect the information itself .\nBy placing restrictions on stingray use , state and local governments limit the data available that the feds can access .\nIn a nutshell , without state and local cooperation , the feds have a much more difficult time gathering information .\nEnactment of HB499/SB246 strikes a major blow to the surveillance state and would be a win for privacy .\nMichael Maharrey [ send him email @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tenth Amendment Center .\nHe is from the original home

Higher \u2013 What\u2019s Next?", "content": "The silver market is on the move .\nIn fact , it \u2019 s finally moving out ahead of other precious metals and showing some real leadership .\nAfter the panic selling of March briefly brought spot silver below $ 12/oz , prices have since surged by 50 % .\nThat \u2019 s an impressive move to take place within the span of just two months .\nThe question for investors now is whether the recent rally in silver is fleeting or sustainable \u2013 whether it \u2019 s evidence of extreme market volatility that suggests more danger ahead or the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ market to come .\nIn our view , there is good reason to believe that the March 2020 lows will never be violated and that silver is therefore in a structural bull market .\nLast Monday , Money Metals posted \u201c Silver Breakout in Progress \u201d as a market update .\nWe noted , \u201c Silver prices will run into some overhead resistance just above the $ 16/oz level .\nOnce broken , that technical line on the weekly chart could serve as a springboard for a run toward $ 19/oz \u2013 and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ presented for an imminent breakout were confirmed that Friday .\nSilver springboarded to $ 17/oz .\nThen yesterday , carryover momentum brought prices up near $ 18/oz before this morning \u2019 s pullback .\nThe bullish mega-trend for silver \u2013 fueled by accelerating monetary debasement , declining worldwide mine production , and strong safe-haven demand \u2013 is likely just beginning .\nAt the same time , there are growing signs of shortages in physical silver , at least in some parts of the world .\nThis week , bullion banks have been scrambling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bars they need to make near-term delivery commitments on the Comex .\nThis shortage in the U.S. of deliverable silver has caused New York spot silver prices to diverge more than 50 cents above London spot .\nSuch a spread is extremely rare , and arbitrageurs do not seem able to transport enough silver from London to New York to close the gap anytime soon .\nNone of this means there can \u2019 t be sharp pullbacks to come .\nSilver is a notoriously volatile commodity that seems to specialize in shaking people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ futures market ) .\nAlthough nothing is guaranteed in these wild and often manipulated markets , the blue line shown in the chart above , which had been resistance , will likely now serve as final support in the event of a selloff .\nFundamentally , a silver price below $ 16/oz is simply not sustainable given that all-in mining costs for the metal currently range into the high teens .\nWhile another bout of irrational panic selling over virus fears is possible should it make a deadly resurgence , the remaining upside @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years ahead far exceeds its downside risk .\nSilver is historically cheap versus just about any other commodity or asset class on the planet .\nWhen measured against gold , silver has never been cheaper \u2013 going back through hundreds of years of record-keeping \u2013 than it was during the depths of the March selling .\nSilver \u2019 s unprecedented cheapness versus gold ( at one point 1/126th the gold price ) gives us further confidence that those extreme lows were anomalous displays of \u201c peak fear \u201d that will never be seen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ silver ratio comes in right around 100:1 .\nAlthough still extremely elevated ( by normal standards ) in favor of gold , silver has been rapidly gaining ground against its pricier counterpart and can be expected to continue closing the gap as the bull market in both metals advances .\nWith an election coming up and uncertainties surrounding the economy and COVID-19 , investor interest in precious metals is likely to remain robust .\nA ballooning federal debt and Federal Reserve balance sheet pose serious risks for holders of U.S. dollars .\nFed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ central bank is \u201c committed to using our full range of tools to support the economy.\n\u201d They are all \u201c tools \u201d of currency debasement , regardless of what jargon or acronyms monetary planners trot out to describe them .\nGranted , safe-haven bullion and ETF buying could taper off in the event that the economic outlook brightens and investor fears recede .\nBut since more than 50 % of silver demand comes from industrial applications , a recovering economy isn \u2019 t necessarily a negative for prices \u2013 especially when so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now turning bullish .\nStefan Gleason is President of Money Metals Exchange , a precious metals dealer recently named \u201c Best in the

Policy Research and the Stanford Freeman Spogli Institute .\nDr. Bhattacharya \u2019 s March 24 Wall Street Journal article \u201c @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Say ?\n\u201d questions the premise that \u201c coronavirus would kill millions without shelter-in-place orders and quarantines.\n\u201d In the article , he suggests that \u201c there \u2019 s little evidence to confirm that premise\u2014and projections of the death toll could plausibly be orders of magnitude too high.\n\u201d The video quotes Dr. Anthony Fauci , Director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Disease at the National Institutes of Health who is a member of the White House Corona Task Force , as saying \u201c The flu has a mortality rate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) has a mortality rate of ten times that.\n\u201d However , Dr. Bhattacharya says that the mortality rate for COVID-19 is 0.01 % !\nThe video points out that , Dr. Bhattacharya explains that there is a lot of debate in the medical community about what the correct numbers are \u2013 and we should be honest about that .\nThe policy makers plugged the worst-case scenarios into their policies and newspapers reported their alarming views which the public accepted as scientific fact that justified the lockdown of the society and destruction of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is a deadly virus , but says that antibody testing on a representative population locally and nation-wide must be done to determine HOW deadly it is \u2013 and that test just became available a few weeks before this interview .\nHe said he hoped that results would be available by the end of April \u2013 if everything goes right .\nOn April 17 in The Fight against COVID-19 : An Update from Dr. Jay Bhattacharya , he reported that local tests confirmed that the COVID-19 mortality rate is 0.01 % \u2014 like a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the data from two larger studies \u2013 one with Major League Baseball .\nOther groups in the US and around the world are planning to do similar studies now .\nDr. Bhattacharya warns that the lockdown could cause a global economic collapse that could kill millions of people !\nHe says the rise in GDP in the 20th century pulled billions of people out of poverty

that destroy society .\nIn Perspectives on the Pandemic | Professor Knut Wittkowski | Episode 2 , epidemiologist Knut Wittkowski explains that we are experiencing horrific consequences now of bad policy decisions .\nThe lockdown has ravaged the economy .\nLockdown has severe consequences for social life and depression will surge .\nClosing the schools was one of the most destructive actions the government has done .\nSince people can get immunity from a flu naturally , a vaccine is not necessary .\nYet , Bill @ @ @ @ @ @ @ until he can force everyone to take a vaccine \u2013 one from which he will profit massively and which is a violation of the Nuremberg Code .\nProfessor Wittkowski explains that the best way to solve the COVID-19 crisis is with \u201c herd immunity \u201d \u2013 not with a lockdown or vaccines .\nHe says that it \u2019 s very important to keep schools open so kids mingle and get herd immunity as fast as possible .\nNursing homes should be closed for about four weeks .\nHe says any respiratory disease goes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for two weeks \u2014 and then is gone .\n\u201c Social distancing \u201d to \u201c flatten the curve \u201d prolongs the crisis .\nThe

guaranteed to CREATE a second wave in the autumn .\nHerd immunity typically lasts for a couple of years .\nSince viruses can not spread outdoors in the spring , one of the best forms of containment is for people to go outdoors now .\n\u201c Social distancing \u201d \u2014 staying indoors \u2014 keeps the virus healthy .\nDr. Wittkowski says the Chinese had an advantage because they didn \u2019 t know what they were dealing with initially .\nSo , before they started the lockdown , there was enough time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nWittkowski explained that since he is not paid by the government , he \u2019 s free to do real science .\nHe says that had the government not intervened , the epidemic would have been over .\nHe said only 2 % of all symptomatic cases would have died \u2013 a high of 10,000 people \u2013 when about 35,000 people die of the flu in the US every year .\nHe says that testing for respiratory disease is neither necessary nor effective .\nWittkowski says that Americans are more docile than they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ t stand up for their constitutional rights now , they will lose those freedoms forever .\nHe says that Americans should be resisting now and holding politicians responsible for their misguided policies that have shut the schools , restaurants , other businesses , and cost Americans so much in so many ways \u2013 all for nothing .\nOn March 26 , Dr. Fauci published an article in the New England Journal of Medicine called \u201c Covid-19 \u2013 Navigating the Uncharted \u201d in which he admitted that , \u201c the overall clinical consequences of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those of a severe seasonal influenza ( which has a fatality rate of approximately 0.1 % .\n\u201d Yet , in Fauci Says Schools May Open In Fall , Dr. Fauci says that whether the schools reopen

\u2013 vaccinate everyone !\nDr. Shiva warns that people will be required to get the mandated vaccines to be allowed to travel , work , etc .\nHe explains that drug companies are not making money from

pure profit with no risk .\nDrug companies can not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ maximum damages for death from a vaccine is $ 250,000 .\nDr. Shiva points out that none of the 30 vaccines recommended by the CDC for young kids has been saline-placebo control tested .\nThe test for the HPV Gardasil vaccine was a fraudulent test .\nDr. Shiva says COVID-19 is a farce brought to you by Dr. Anthony Fauci .\nDr. Shiva said he believes Fauci should be indicted .\nFauci built his career on the false narrative that HIV causes AIDS .\nPeter Duesberg , a truly great scientist , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , showed that AIDS in America and Europe us not caused by the HIV virus , but by drug use .\nHowever , when Fauci promoted bogus science and created the fear that HIV causes AIDS , billions of dollars were spent on that idea .\nA lot of people who used the AZT drug prescribed to treat AIDS died from the drug itself .\nHowever , Deusberg showed that the lifestyles of AIDS patients who were taking so many drugs was destroying their immune systems .\nSo , Fauci doesn \u2019 t @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nEverything is about the bogeyman of viruses that can be treated with vaccines .\nHe is the face of Big Pharma and vaccines .\nHe sees the COVID-19 panic as his opportunity to become a national hero .\nCOVID-19 was designed to scare people into accepting the vaccine agenda \u201c for the common good \u201d .\nMost MDs do not know what the immune system is because they don \u2019 t study nutrition .\nHowever , for people who understand the immune system , the COVID-19 fear-mongering is laughable .\nWe get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ diet that no longer has any vitamins and nutrients .\nWe don \u2019 t get enough Vitamin D , Vitamin C , Vitamin A .\nThe focus should be encouraging Americans to eat more nutritious foods to build up their immune systems \u2013 not to submit to untested vaccines .\nNew Report from Prestigious \u201c British Medical Journal \u201d Suggests Quarantine May Have Already Killed More Seniors Than The Coronavirus gives just one indication of how disastrous the lockdown has been while claiming to protect people from what is now widely recognized to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now widely recognized that COVID-19 is at most a seasonal flu , the insanity of government policy rages on beyond the disastrous lockdown .\nNew York City major Bill de Blasio was enforcing \u201c social distancing \u201d in parks with $ 1,000 tickets for people \u201c caught \u201d closer than six feet apart !\nConsider the people in the photo below .\nThey may be husband and wife who sleep together every night and a sister who is visiting them .\nAt home , they eat meals and watch TV together \u2013 not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do they have to be six feet apart outdoors \u2013 or risk being fined $ 1,000 each ?\nNew York City increases social distancing fines to $ 1,000 , Mayor de Blasio : says : So , we should report on our neighbors for being \u201c too close \u201d in public ?\nThat sounds like Nazi Germany or the Soviet Union , not the Land of the Free .\nObviously , it makes zero sense for people who live together to have to remain six feet apart in public or risk being fined @ @ @ @ @ @ @ s the REAL reason for NYC police enforcing \u201c social distancing \u201d rules ?\nFortunately , push back from the public , the media , and the Police Benevolent Association of New York City is bringing some sanity into the situation now .\nNew York Mayor Announces NYPD Will Scale Back Social Distancing Enforcement said on May 15 : PBA in the News shows that the Police Benevolent Association of New York City has been firmly against the mayor \u2019 s use of police to enforce \u201c social distancing \u201d rules .\nClearly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flu .\nWhile it is good that Mayor de Blasio is scaling back some of the most Orwellian policies , why is he still forbidding \u201c more than a handful of people \u201d to get together ?\nWhy is de Blasio saying that police will continue to break up \u201c large gatherings \u201d .\nHow large ?\nUntil now , the COVID-19 policies limited groups to 10 people .\nWill 20 people be \u201c allowed \u201d to exercise their unalienable First Amendment rights of free assembly now ?\nHow about 100 people ?\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ left unclear ?\nThat puts people unnecessarily at risk .\nIf it \u2019 s \u201c ok \u201d for 20 people to get together now , what happens if one more person shows up ?\nIs that over the limit according to Mayor de Blasio \u2019 s unconstitutional rules ?\nWhere does Mayor de Blasio think he can draw the line on our First Amendment right of assembly ?\nAs the mayor of NYC , Bill de Blasio took an oath of office in which he swore to abide by the US Constitution .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ that oath now , he should resign immediately .\nAmericans do not need the permission of mayor or governors to gather in groups of whatever size we choose because the First Amendment protects our unalienable right of assembly .\nSince it is clear that health is not the reason to limit the size of groups , what is the REAL reason for restricting gatherings ?\nIt seems obvious that the government fears massive public criticism for its unprecedented and unjustified shut down of the US economy which has cost $ 2 trillion so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of work !\nIn reaction to a seasonal flu , the government closed restaurants which has dramatically affected to food chain .\nIt shut down schools which robbed students from kindergarten to graduate school of a semester of study \u2013 depriving many people of graduation ceremonies and proms .\nThe COVID-19 polices shut down sports events including the Boston Marathon and Masters golf tournament .\nThe policies have disrupted weddings and funerals .\nThe government also has reason to fear massive public opposition to its bizarre upcoming COVID-19 policies which include \u201c contact @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vaccine .\nDr. Knut Wittkowski has explained that contact tracing can be done for sexually transmitted diseases because most people know whom they had sex with recently .\nHowever , it can not be done with the flu .\nSince he lives in New York City , Dr. Wittkowski gave the example of a New Yorker taking a bus to a subway to go to work , going to a restaurant for lunch and later for dinner and then to a Broadway play in the evening .\nDuring the course of the day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with hundreds , and possibly thousands of people , few of whom could be identified .\nSo , all talk of \u201c contact tracing \u201d has nothing to do with health or the desire to protect anyone from COVID-19 .\nNew York Governor Cuomo opened New York beaches starting with the Memorial Day weekend .\nHowever , Mayor de Blasio says that \u201c New York beaches are not ready to re-open any time soon \u201d .\nWhat does a beach have to do to get ready to receive people ?\nWhat lunacy is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ As You Obey \u201c Exceptionally Cruel and Insensitive Health Officials \u201d by Dr. Mark Sircus should be read in full .\nMuch of it is quoted here .\nDr. Sircus says : Not only are they cruel and insensitive but they are outright liars ( they love scary predictions that do not come true ) and do not want to listen to anyone who disagrees with their insensible plans to destroy human civilization .\nThey are destroyers of human existence , human activity , human happiness and even human health .\nTo be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for death of the world economy , increased death by suicide , increased death by over a million from tuberculous , vastly increased homelessness , and for millions to die of starvation .\nThat is the short list .\nIt has not completely sunk in yet but the real nightmare is just getting started .\nMore than four out of five people in the global labor force of 3.3 billion have been hit by full or partial workplace closures , according to the International Labor Organization , which says 1.6 billion workers in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ danger of having their livelihoods destroyed.\n\u201d How a few men got the politicians of the world to do this is something that history will have to eventually answer .\nMore than 36 million have filed for unemployment in the United States since mid-March .\nIt is not a depression we are entering but a collapse that could halt most human activity .\nIf the coronavirus pandemic continues to drive unemployment levels as high as predicted , homelessness will increase 40 % to 45 % by the end of the year , according @ @ @ @ @ @ @ economics professor .\nThat would mean 250,000 more people in the US would experience homelessness compared with last year , bringing the total number of those experiencing homelessness to above 800,000 .\nHow can we possibly measure the human suffering as a consequence of what is being done following the orders of health care officials ?\nFor those who oppose the orders it might be a good time to revisit the teaching of Martin Luther King Jr. \u201c Martin King , was a minister who exposed the truth that obedience keeps us in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ combine disobedience with goodness .\nHis crucial work ( and this is greatly under-appreciated ) was to hold disobedience and goodness together.\n\u201d There is open lockdown rebellion in Pennsylvania and demonstrations in England and Germany\u2026 .\nWorld health officials are not practicing medicine or public health they are practicing cold-hardheartedness .\nThey along with politicians are acting like the original communists and fascists who believed that their way was the only way , killing or censoring anyone who disagrees .\nCertain epidemiologists have said there is very little sturdy evidence to base @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not prevented politicians from acting as if everything they say or do is based on solid science\u2026 .\nWhile many European cities begin the process of reviving their economies , the Big Apple \u2014 America \u2019 s coronavirus epicenter \u2014 remains shut as authorities fear sparking another wave of COVID-19 infections .\nSo let the city die and long live fear !\nSweden never closed down in the first place and they are not having more difficulties with the virus than countries that have lockdown their people .\nWe have let the fears @ @ @ @ @ @ @ create a form of hysteria never seen before .\nThe article links to an article about Dr. King : Nothing Changes As Long As You Obey .\nAlso see Dr. Sircus \u2019 articles Greatest Civilization Collapse in History and Medical Coup D \u2019 \u00e9tat \u2013 The Culling of Humanity .\nOn August 28 , 1963 , Dr. Martin Luther King , Jr. delivered his \u201c I Have a Dream \u201d speech to over 250,000 people at the Lincoln Memorial .\nDr. King began : \u201c I am happy to join with you today @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as the greatest demonstration for freedom in the history of our nation.\n\u201d He added : \u201c Now is the time to make real the promises of democracy\u2026.It would be fatal for the nation to overlook the urgency of the moment\u2026 .\nI say to you today , my friends , so even though we face the difficulties of today and tomorrow , I still have a dream .\nIt is a dream deeply rooted in the American dream .\nI have a dream that one day this nation will rise up and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ creed.\n\u201d Americans were free in 1963 to gather and speak truth to power and to correct the long abuses of the state and federal governments .\nThat historic speech helped sway the nation and eventually led to the Civil Rights laws that today protect the rights of millions of Americans .\nSuch is the power of Freedom of Assembly and Freedom of Speech .\nThat \u2019 s why the US Founding Father chose the First Amendment to protect these foundational freedoms .\nNow , under the pretext of \u201c keeping us all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a seasonal flu to destroy our ability to organize and protest the growing abuses of government .\nDestroying the First Amendment right of Freedom of Assembly is not protecting us .\nIt is destroying America .\nAmerica needs a second Civil Rights Movement now .\nWe must assert our First Amendment right of Free Assembly and gather in crowds of whatever size we choose .\nWe need people who are willing to go to jail , if necessary , as Dr. King and many members of the Civil Rights Movement did .\nThey @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hoses .\nTheir answer was in song \u201c We shall not be moved \u201d .\nThey were unshakeable in their defense of freedom .\nThey understood their rights and would accept nothing less .\nThere is a time for civil disobedience as Henry David Thoreau wrote in the 19th century in his historic Civil Disobedience and On the Duty of Civil Disobedience .\nThe US Founding Fathers told us in The Declaration of Independence that there is a time to replace governments that don \u2019 t serve the needs of the people .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Communist China every day , the only question now is the one that was asked in the beginning of our republic : \u201c Does the star-spangled banner yet wave o \u2019 er the Land of the Free and the Home of the Brave ?\n\u201d If you would need to be reminded what an American sounds like or if you would like to remind others , see the inspiring May 17 video interview with Sheriff Richard Mack of Arizona Sheriff Mack Calls on Sheriffs : America Has Become a Catastrophe !\nWe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for his role in a successful lawsuit taken to the Supreme Court against the federal government which

churches , and schools @ @ @ @ @ @ @ six apart , limit freedom of assembly , engage in \u201c contact tracing \u201d , or forced vaccinations !\nWe have a US Constitution because people like Patrick

would kill millions without shelter-in-place orders and quarantines.\n\u201d In the article , he suggests that \u201c there \u2019 s little evidence to confirm that premise\u2014and projections of the death toll could plausibly be orders of magnitude too high.\n\u201d The video quotes Dr. Anthony Fauci , Director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Disease at the National Institutes of Health who is a member of the White House Corona Task Force , as saying \u201c The flu has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This ( COVID-19 ) has a mortality rate of ten times that.\n\u201d However , Dr. Bhattacharya says that the mortality rate for COVID-19 is 0.01 % !\nThe video points out that , Dr. Bhattacharya explains that there is a lot of debate in the medical community about what the correct numbers are \u2013 and we should be honest about that .\nThe policy makers plugged the worst-case scenarios into their policies and newspapers reported their alarming views which the public accepted as scientific fact that justified the lockdown of the society @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bhattacharya believes COVID-19 is a deadly virus , but says that antibody testing on a representative population locally and nation-wide must be done to determine HOW deadly it is \u2013 and that test just became available a few weeks before this interview .\nHe said he hoped that results would be available by the end of April \u2013 if everything goes right .\nOn April 17 in The Fight against COVID-19 : An Update from Dr. Jay Bhattacharya , he reported that local tests confirmed that the COVID-19 mortality rate is 0.01 % @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will soon publish the data from two larger studies \u2013 one with Major League Baseball .\nOther groups in the US and around the world are planning to do similar studies now .\nDr. Bhattacharya warns that the lockdown could cause a global economic collapse that could kill millions of people !\nHe says the rise in GDP in the 20th century pulled billions of people out of poverty and raised life expectancy everywhere .\nIt that gets reversed , it means many lives will be shortened unnecessarily .\nSo , it \u2019 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and policies right \u2013 and not to overreact in ways that destroy society .\nIn Perspectives on the Pandemic | Professor Knut Wittkowski | Episode 2 , epidemiologist Knut Wittkowski explains that we are experiencing horrific consequences now of bad policy decisions .\nThe lockdown has ravaged the economy .\nLockdown has severe consequences for social life and depression will surge .\nClosing the schools was one of the most destructive actions the government has done .\nSince people can get immunity from a flu naturally , a vaccine is not necessary .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ lockdown must continue until he can force everyone to take a vaccine \u2013 one from which he will profit massively and which is a violation of the Nuremberg Code .\nProfessor Wittkowski explains that the best way to solve the COVID-19 crisis is with \u201c herd immunity \u201d \u2013 not with a lockdown or vaccines .\nHe says that it \u2019 s very important to keep schools open so kids mingle and get herd immunity as fast as possible .\nNursing homes should be closed for about four weeks .\nHe says any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ peaks , goes for two weeks \u2014 and then is gone .\n\u201c Social distancing \u201d to \u201c flatten the curve \u201d prolongs the crisis .\nThe reported \u201c second wave \u201d will be a direct consequence of \u201c flattening the curve \u201d with social distancing \u2013 and will be used to justify another lockdown !\nHe says COVID-19 was nothing to be scared of because it is a flu like every other flu .\nIf the schools and business had remained open , we would have herd immunity now and there could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , social distancing is almost guaranteed to CREATE a second wave in the autumn .\nHerd immunity typically lasts for a couple of years .\nSince viruses can not spread outdoors in the spring , one of the best forms of containment is for people to go outdoors now .\n\u201c Social distancing \u201d \u2014 staying indoors \u2014 keeps the virus healthy .\nDr. Wittkowski says the Chinese had an advantage because they didn \u2019 t know what they were dealing with initially .\nSo , before they started the lockdown , there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reach herd immunity .\nWittkowski explained that since he is not paid by the government , he \u2019 s free to do real science .\nHe says that had the government not intervened , the epidemic would have been over .\nHe said only 2 % of all symptomatic cases would have died \u2013 a high of 10,000 people \u2013 when about 35,000 people die of the flu in the US every year .\nHe says that testing for respiratory disease is neither necessary nor effective .\nWittkowski says that Americans are more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people don \u2019 t stand up for their constitutional rights now , they will lose those freedoms forever .\nHe says that Americans should be resisting now and holding politicians responsible for their misguided policies that have shut the schools , restaurants , other businesses , and cost Americans so much in so many ways \u2013 all for nothing .\nOn March 26 , Dr. Fauci published an article in the New England Journal of Medicine called \u201c Covid-19 \u2013 Navigating the Uncharted \u201d in which he admitted that , \u201c the overall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more akin to those of a severe seasonal influenza ( which has a fatality rate of approximately 0.1 % .\n\u201d Yet , in Fauci Says Schools May Open In Fall , Dr. Fauci says that whether the schools reopen in the fall depends on the \u201c flattening of cases \u201d .\nThat means schools may NOT open even in the fall .\nHe warns that a \u201c second wave \u201d will require another lockdown .\nOn

totally controlled by Big Pharma , Big Ag , and big vaccine manufacturers .\nThe utopia of the \u201c elite \u201d has 17 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that to achieve those goals , everyone on the planet must be immunized \u2013 vaccinate everyone !\nDr. Shiva warns that people will be required to get the mandated vaccines to be allowed to travel , work , etc .\nHe explains that drug companies are not making money from pharmaceutical drugs now because it is so costly to develop a drug and the FDA is approving fewer drugs now because of their toxicity .\nSo , drug companies have moved to vaccines because they are pure profit with no risk .\nDrug @ @ @ @ @ @ @ injuries and the maximum damages for death from a vaccine is $ 250,000 .\nDr. Shiva points out that none of the 30 vaccines recommended by the CDC for young kids has been saline-placebo control tested .\nThe test for the HPV Gardasil vaccine was a fraudulent test .\nDr. Shiva says COVID-19 is a farce brought to you by Dr. Anthony Fauci .\nDr. Shiva said he believes Fauci should be indicted .\nFauci built his career on the false narrative that HIV causes AIDS .\nPeter Duesberg , a truly great @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tenure at Berkley , showed that AIDS in America and Europe us not caused by the HIV virus , but by drug use .\nHowever , when Fauci promoted bogus science and created the fear that HIV causes AIDS , billions of dollars were spent on that idea .\nA lot of people who used the AZT drug prescribed to treat AIDS died from the drug itself .\nHowever , Deusberg showed that the lifestyles of AIDS patients who were taking so many drugs was destroying their immune systems .\nSo , Fauci @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the immune system .\nEverything is about the bogeyman of viruses that can be treated with vaccines .\nHe is the face of Big Pharma and vaccines .\nHe sees the COVID-19 panic as his opportunity to become a national hero .\nCOVID-19 was designed to scare people into accepting the vaccine agenda \u201c for the common good \u201d .\nMost MDs do not know what the immune system is because they don \u2019 t study nutrition .\nHowever , for people who understand the immune system , the COVID-19 fear-mongering is laughable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by eating a diet that no longer has any vitamins and nutrients .\nWe don \u2019 t get enough Vitamin D , Vitamin C , Vitamin A .\nThe focus should be encouraging Americans to eat more nutritious foods to build up their immune systems \u2013 not to submit to untested vaccines .\nNew Report from Prestigious \u201c British Medical Journal \u201d Suggests Quarantine May Have Already Killed More Seniors Than The Coronavirus gives just one indication of how disastrous the lockdown has been while claiming to protect people from what is now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Although it is now widely recognized that COVID-19 is at most a seasonal flu , the insanity of government policy rages on beyond the disastrous lockdown .\nNew York City major Bill de Blasio was enforcing \u201c social distancing \u201d in parks with $ 1,000 tickets for people \u201c caught \u201d closer than six feet apart !\nConsider the people in the photo below .\nThey may be husband and wife who sleep together every night and a sister who is visiting them .\nAt home , they eat meals and watch TV @ @ @ @ @ @ @ So , why do they have to be six feet apart outdoors \u2013 or risk being fined $ 1,000 each ?\nNew York City increases social distancing fines to $ 1,000 , Mayor de Blasio : says : So , we should report on our neighbors for being \u201c too close \u201d in public ?\nThat sounds like Nazi Germany or the Soviet Union , not the Land of the Free .\nObviously , it makes zero sense for people who live together to have to remain six feet apart in public or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , what \u2019 s the REAL reason for NYC police enforcing \u201c social distancing \u201d rules ?\nFortunately , push back from the public , the media , and the Police Benevolent Association of New York City is bringing some sanity into the situation now .\nNew York Mayor Announces NYPD Will Scale Back Social Distancing Enforcement said on May 15 : PBA in the News shows that the Police Benevolent Association of New York City has been firmly against the mayor \u2019 s use of police to enforce \u201c social distancing \u201d @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over a seasonal flu .\nWhile it is good that Mayor de Blasio is scaling back some of the most Orwellian policies , why is he still forbidding \u201c more than a handful of people \u201d to get together ?\nWhy is de Blasio saying that police will continue to break up \u201c large gatherings \u201d .\nHow large ?\nUntil now , the COVID-19 policies limited groups to 10 people .\nWill 20 people be \u201c allowed \u201d to exercise their unalienable First Amendment rights of free assembly now ?\nHow about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of permissible groups left unclear ?\nThat puts people unnecessarily at risk .\nIf it \u2019 s \u201c ok \u201d for 20 people to get together now , what happens if one more person shows up ?\nIs that over the limit according to Mayor de Blasio \u2019 s unconstitutional rules ?\nWhere does Mayor de Blasio think he can draw the line on our First Amendment right of assembly ?\nAs the mayor of NYC , Bill de Blasio took an oath of office in which he swore to abide by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ want to keep that oath now , he should resign immediately .\nAmericans do not need the permission of mayor or governors to gather in groups of whatever size we choose because the First Amendment protects our unalienable right of assembly .\nSince it is clear that health is not the reason to limit the size of groups , what is the REAL reason for restricting gatherings ?\nIt seems obvious that the government fears massive public criticism for its unprecedented and unjustified shut down of the US economy which has cost $ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ million Americans out of work !\nIn reaction to a seasonal flu , the government closed restaurants which has dramatically affected to food chain .\nIt shut down schools which robbed students from kindergarten to graduate school of a semester of study \u2013 depriving many people of graduation ceremonies and proms .\nThe COVID-19 polices shut down sports events including the Boston Marathon and Masters golf tournament .\nThe policies have disrupted weddings and funerals .\nThe government also has reason to fear massive public opposition to its bizarre upcoming COVID-19 policies which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ possibly mandatory untested vaccine .\nDr. Knut Wittkowski has explained that contact tracing can be done for sexually transmitted diseases because most people know whom they had sex with recently .\nHowever , it can not be done with the flu .\nSince he lives in New York City , Dr. Wittkowski gave the example of a New Yorker taking a bus to a subway to go to work , going to a restaurant for lunch and later for dinner and then to a Broadway play in the evening .\nDuring the course @ @ @ @ @ @ @ come in contact with hundreds , and possibly thousands of people , few of whom could be identified .\nSo , all talk of \u201c contact tracing \u201d has nothing to do with health or the desire to protect anyone from

should be read in full .\nMuch of it is quoted here .\nDr. Sircus says : Not only are they cruel and insensitive but they are outright liars ( they love scary predictions that do not come true ) and do not want to listen to anyone who disagrees with their insensible plans to destroy human civilization .\nThey are destroyers of human existence , human activity , human happiness and even human health @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is to be for death of the world economy , increased death by suicide , increased death by over a million from tuberculous , vastly increased homelessness , and for millions to die

homelessness compared with last year , bringing the total number of those experiencing homelessness to above 800,000 .\nHow can we possibly measure the human suffering as a consequence of what is being done following the orders of health care officials ?\nFor those who oppose the orders it might be a good time to revisit the teaching of Martin Luther King Jr. \u201c Martin King , was a minister who exposed the truth that obedience @ @ @ @ @ @ @ synthesis was to combine disobedience with goodness .\nHis crucial work ( and this is greatly under-appreciated ) was to hold disobedience and goodness together.\n\u201d There is open lockdown rebellion in Pennsylvania and demonstrations in England and Germany\u2026 .\nWorld health officials are not practicing medicine or public health they are practicing cold-hardheartedness .\nThey along with politicians are acting like the original communists and fascists who believed that their way was the only way , killing or censoring anyone

( May 26 , 2020 ) \u2013 Last week , Virginia Gov .\nRalph Northam gave final approval to a bill to decriminalize marijuana possession with a recommended amendment despite federal prohibition .\nA bipartisan coalition of senators and representatives introduced House Bill 972 ( HB972 ) and Senate Bill 2 ( SB2 ) earlier this year .\nUnder the law , marijuana will remain illegal in the state , but possession of up to an ounce of cannabis will now be a civil infraction subject to a $ 25 fine instead of a criminal offense .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ a half-ounce or less is punishable by up to 30 days in jail and a $ 500 fine .\nPossession of hash and other concentrates is a felony .\nThe legislation also includes provisions to seal the records of past and future marijuana convictions and bars most employers from asking about marijuana convictions in the hiring process .\nThe bill took a winding path to final approval .\nDifferent versions of the bill were initially passed by the House and the Senate leading to a conference committee .\nThe Senate passed the final @ @ @ @ @ @ @ measure 56-36 .\nGov .\nNortham gave his approval to the measure on April 11 , but he recommended amendments , including one that would push the date of a legislative study on the legalization of marijuana back one year to November 2021 .\nThe legislature rejected the delay , but approved other technical amendments , sending the bill back to the governor .\nOn May 21 , Northam signed the bill and it will go into effect July 1 .\nSen. Adam Ebbin ( D-Alexandria ) carried the bill in the Senate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ law would be good news for thousands of Virginians .\nAccording to a point-in-time study included in a State Crime Commission report , there were 127 people being held in Virginia jails solely on marijuana charges on one day in July 2017 .\nWhile the enactment of HB972/SB2 will not end marijuana prohibition in Virginia , it will drastically reduce prosecution and disincentivize enforcement efforts .\nUnder the federal Controlled Substances Act ( CSA ) passed in 1970 , the federal government maintains complete prohibition of marijuana .\nOf course , the federal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or regulate cannabis within the borders of a state , despite the opinion of the politically connected lawyers on the Supreme Court .\nIf you doubt this , ask yourself why it took a constitutional amendment to institute federal alcohol prohibition .\nDespite federal prohibition , Virginia legalized medical marijuana in 2018 and expanded the program last year .\nDecriminalization of marijuana would remove yet another layer of laws punishing the possession and use of marijuana in the state , but federal prohibition would remain in effect .\nThis is significant because FBI @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 99 of 100 marijuana arrests under state , not federal law .\nWhen states stop enforcing marijuana laws , they sweep away most of the basis for 99 percent of marijuana arrests .\nFurthermore , figures indicate it would take 40 percent of the DEA \u2019 s yearly-budget just to investigate and raid all of the dispensaries in Los Angeles \u2013 a single city in a single state .\nThat doesn \u2019 t include the cost of prosecution .\nThe lesson ?\nThe feds lack the resources to enforce marijuana prohibition without state @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of states increasingly ignoring federal prohibition , and nullifying it in practice .\nColorado , Washington state , Oregon and Alaska were the first states to legalize recreational cannabis , and California , Nevada , Maine and Massachusetts joined them after ballot initiatives in favor of legalization passed in November 2016 .\nMichigan followed suit when voters legalized cannabis for general use in 2018 .\nVermont became the first state to legalize marijuana through a legislative act in 2018 .\nIllinois followed suit in 2019 .\nWith 33 states including allowing cannabis for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a position where they simply can \u2019 t enforce prohibition anymore .\nThe lesson here is pretty straightforward .\nWhen enough people say , \u2018 No !\n\u2019 to the federal government , and enough states pass laws backing those people up , there \u2019 s not much the feds can do to shove their so-called laws , regulations or mandates down our throats .\nThe push to decriminalize marijuana in Virginia underscores another important strategic reality .\nOnce a state legalizes marijuana \u2013 even if only in a very limited way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ As the state tears down some barriers , markets develop and demand expands .\nThat creates pressure to further relax state law .\nThese new laws represent a further erosion of unconstitutional federal marijuana prohibition .\nMichael Maharrey [

shelter-in-place restrictions , the conversation on COVID-19 has turned to questions of when and how we can return to work , take kids to school , or plan air travel .\nSeveral countries and U.S. states , including the UK , Italy , Chile , Germany , and California , have expressed interest in so-called \u201c immunity passports \u201d \u2014a system of requiring people to present supposed proof of immunity to COVID-19 in order to access public spaces , work sites , airports , schools , or other venues .\nIn many proposed schemes , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ digital token on a phone .\nImmunity passports would threaten our privacy and information security , and would be a significant step toward a system of national digital identification that can be used to collect and store our personal information and track our location .\nImmunity passports are purportedly intended to help combat the spread of COVID-19 .\nBut there is little evidence that they would actually accomplish that .\nOn a practical level , there is currently no test for COVID-19 immunity ; what we have are antibody tests .\nBut we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ antibodies have immunity .\nMeanwhile , there has been a flood of flawed tests and fraudulent marketing schemes about antibody tests .\nEven when validated tests are widely available , they may not be 100 percent accurate .\nThe system should be a non-starter unless it can guarantee due process for those who want to challenge their test results .\nThis has often been a problem before ; as we saw with the \u201c no-fly \u201d lists created after 9/11 , it is very difficult to get off the list , even for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The problem with immunity passports isn \u2019 t just medical\u2014it \u2019 s ethical .\nAccess to both COVID-19 testing and antibody testing is spotty .\nReports abound of people who fear they have been infected desperately trying to get tested to no avail .\nAnalysis has shown that African Americans are far less likely than white , Hispanic , or Asian patients to be tested before they end up in the emergency room .\nMobile testing sites administered by Verily ( a subsidiary of Google \u2019 s parent Alphabet ) require people to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nResidents in San Francisco \u2019 s Tenderloin district , one of the city \u2019 s poorest neighborhoods , were turned away from testing sites because they didn \u2019 t have cell phones .\nRequiring smartphone-based immunity verification to access public spaces like offices and schools would exacerbate existing inequities and reinforce a two-tiered system of the privileged , who can move about freely in society , and the vulnerable , who can \u2019 t work , shop , or attend school because they don \u2019 t have a cell phone or access @ @ @ @ @ @ @ here before .\nWhen yellow fever struck the South in the 1850s , those thought to be \u201c unacclimated \u201d to the disease were unemployable .\nThis burdened black and lower-income people more than privileged members of society .\nAs we saw then , conditioning access to society on immunity incentivizes \u201c bug-chasing \u201d \u2014that is , people deliberately trying to get sick in order to get the immunity passport .\nNo one should have to expose themselves to a potentially deadly disease with no cure to find work .\nThe push for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the promise of technological solutions to a public health crisis .\nA proposed bill in California , for example , would use blockchain technology to facilitate an immunity passport system on peoples \u2019 smartphones .\nWe oppose this bill .\nTechnological advancements such as blockchain technology or other methods of implementation do not address our objections to this type of system in of itself .\nMoreover , digital-format immunity passports could normalize digital-format proof-of-status documents more generally .\nAdvocates of immunity passports visualize a world where we can \u2019 t pass through a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or restaurant until the gatekeeper scans our credentials .\nThis would habituate gatekeepers to demand such status credentials , and habituate the public to submit to these demands .\nThis digital system could easily be expanded to check not just a person \u2019 s immunity status , but any other bit of personal information that a gatekeeper might deem relevant , such as age , pregnancy , HIV status , or criminal history .\nThe system could also be adjusted to document not just a particular person \u2019 s status , but also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that required proof of such status .\nAnd all data of all such passages could be accumulated into one database .\nThis would be a troubling step towards digital national identification , which EFF has long opposed because it would create new ways to digitally monitor our movements and activities .\nDigital format documentation also brings the risk of presenting such documentation under duress to varying authorities .\nHanding over your phone to police , unlocked or not , includes significant risks , especially for people in vulnerable communities\u2014risks that could lead to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ potential abuse of power by law enforcement .\nMoreover , requiring people to store their medical test results in a digital format would expose private medical information to the danger of data breaches .\nAgain , this is hardly new\u2014we have seen exactly these types of breaches in the past when medical information has been digitized and collected .\nJust last year , for example , an HIV database in Singapore leaked the personal information of more than 14,000 individuals

"content": "By Derrick Broze , The Last American Vagabond Over the last four months Bill Gates has made dozens of media appearances where he has called for several controversial \u201c solutions \u201d to COVID-19 .\nGates says these proposals must be implemented before society can go back to \u201c normal.\n\u201d From calling for extended lockdowns , health surveillance ( aka contact tracing ) and digital certificates .\nThe science behind the lockdowns has been called into question numerous times by health experts .\nMost recently , Michael Levitt , a Stanford University professor who predicted the initial trajectory of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lockdown was a \u201c huge mistake \u201d and may have actually cost lives .\nTLAV has also exposed contact tracing and the call for an \u201c army \u201d of people to monitor the public as an expansion of surveillance .\nCoincidentally , it was reported just this week that the Gates Foundation recently invested hundreds of millions of dollars into tech companies like Google , who may end up building the contact tracing infrastructure .\nWhat Gates describes as \u201c digital certificates \u201d sounds identical to what some are calling \u201c immunity passports @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that will hold an individual \u2019 s health data , as well as their vaccine status .\nDuring a Reddit AMA , Gates stated , \u201c Eventually we will have some digital certificates to show who has recovered or been tested recently or when we have a vaccine who has received it.\n\u201d What Gates describes \u2013 a digital certificate to prove who has been vaccinated \u2013 sounds similar to the recent calls for passengers to use immunity passports before being allowed to fly .\nHowever , Gates \u2019 statements and philanthropy reveal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for global health : \u201d the promotion of vaccinations for the entire world .\nRather than focus on clean water , access to housing , or any number of other proposals to help the world \u2019 s poorest , Gates believes that access to vaccines is most pressing .\nLong before COVID-19 the Gates Foundation had been involved in funding controversial vaccine efforts in Africa and India .\nA 2015 report titled , Philanthropic Power and Development : Who shapes the agenda ?\n, examines the influence of global philanthropy and provides examples @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can wield .\nThe report outlines much of what we describe in Part 1 of this investigation , including how , \u201c through the placement of Foundation staff in decision-making bodies of international organizations and global health partnerships \u201d the Gates Foundation influences and guides public health policy .\nThe Gates Foundation is a board member not only of GAVI , but also of the Global Fund , the Partnership for Maternal , Newborn and Child Health , the Medicines for Malaria Venture , the Roll Back Malaria Partnership , the TB Alliance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many others .\nThe investigation also provides detail on Gates \u2019 investments in vaccines and his connections with vaccine manufacturers .\nAs reported in Part 2 of this investigation , in 2010 the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation launched the \u201c Decade of Vaccines \u201d and called for a \u201c Global Vaccine Action Plan.\n\u201d They also helped created the public-private partnership known as GAVI , or the Global Alliance for Vaccines and Immunization .\n\u201c The Gates Foundation provided an initial five-year pledge of US $ 750 million as seed money to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and has remained its driving force and its largest donor , \u201d the report states .\n\u201c Between 2000 and 2014 the Gates Foundation contributed 23 percent ( US $ 2,287.94 million ) of the total donor funding of around US $ 9.9 billion.\n\u201d The report noted that researchers have been critical of GAVI for following a \u201c Gates-approach \u201d on global health challenges , \u201c focusing on disease-specific vertical health interventions ( through vaccines ) , instead of horizontal and holistic approaches ( e.g.\n, health system strengthening ) .\n\u201d @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Gates Foundation \u2019 s support of GAVI has encouraged vaccine manufacturers to produce specific vaccines resulting in \u201c over $ 1 billion to Pfizer and GlaxoSmithKline ( GSK ) .\n\u201d The non-governmental organization Doctors without Borders ( MSF ) has also questioned the GAVI Alliance \u2019 s overall impact on vaccine affordability , stating that \u201c the cost to fully immunize a child was 68 times more expensive in 2014 than it was in 2001.\n\u201d MSF also calls for GAVI to exclude pharmaceutical companies from their board of directors in order @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the most important takeaways from the investigation is that the Gates Foundation operates a revolving door between Foundation staff and Big Pharma companies like Merck and GSK .\nThe report provides several examples of this revolving door , including Trevor Mundel , the president of the Global Health Division of the Gates Foundation , previously worked with Novartis , Pfizer and Parke-Davis .\nMundel \u2019 s predecessor , Tachi Yamada , had been an executive and board member of GSK .\nKim Bush , responsible for partnership initiatives with healthcare for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ International Healthcare Corporation .\nPenny Heaton , Director of Vaccine Development at the Gates Foundation since 2013 , worked before for Novartis Vaccines and Diagnostics and for Merck & Co. Another interesting note from the report is how the Foundation has a $ 52 million equity stage in German pharmaceutical company , CureVac .\nThe collaboration is meant to speed up the development of messenger RNA ( mRNA ) vaccines against various diseases , including rotavirus , HIV and respiratory syncytial virus .\nThe mRNA-vaccine has been discussed as a potential candidate for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ company Moderna Therapeutics is leading the way for mRNA therapeutics and potential vaccines .\nModerna \u2019 s RNA vaccine program has received $ 100 million in funding from the Gates Foundation .\nModerna \u2019 s controversial mRNA vaccine was also developed with a $ 25 million grant from the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency ( DARPA ) .\nAs TLAV reported , Donald Trump also appointed Dr. Moncef Slaoui \u2013 a former Big Pharma exec who up until recently sat on the board of Moderna \u2013 as his \u201c Vaccine Czar \u201d to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Trump administration \u2019 s effort to fast track a vaccine by the end of 2020 .\nIn 2016 , Slaoui was appointed to the Board of Directors of Moderna Therapeutics .\nHe resigned upon being appointed to a position in the current US administration .\nTLAV writer Whitney Webb recently reported on Moderna \u2019 s role in the fight against COVID-19 and their connections to the Gates Foundation : Webb goes on to detail how Moderna is working with the U.S. NIH to develop a vaccine for the new coronavirus and how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ CEPI , which in turn was founded and funded by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation .\nIt should come as no surprise that Bill Gates is now openly supporting RNA vaccines .\nThe development of these vaccines \u2014 and the overall effort of Operation Warp Speed \u2014 is ignoring the already shaky protocols and safety measures for manufacturing vaccines .\nOperation Warp Speed and the subsequent human trials involving 100,000 volunteers \u201c will compress what is typically 10 years of vaccine development and testing into a matter of months.\n\u201d The rush @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has not been properly tested is even more worrisome considering Gates \u2019 recent statements about the need to vaccinate the entire world \u2019 s population .\nIn a blog on his website , Gate states , \u201c The goal is to pick the one or two best vaccine constructs and vaccinate the entire world\u2014that \u2019 s 7 billion doses if it is a single-dose vaccine , and 14 billion if it is a two-dose vaccine.\n\u201d Gates \u2019 push for a mandatory vaccine will likely heavily impact the decisions of the WHO , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ organizations which he funds , influences , or is a board member of .\nGates \u2019 funding of a \u201c quantum-dot tattoo \u201d that can store vaccination records has done little to quell dissent and fear of his true motivations .\nDespite the heralding of Gates as a hero who has saved millions of lives , the thought of forcing vaccinations has sparked a growing opposition to vaccines and concerns about their safety .\nWhether it \u2019 s the CDC whistleblower , Dr. Andrew Zimmerman \u2019 s testimony about the safety of vaccines @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of choice \u2013 people around the world are skeptical of the safety of the vaccines and the influence of Big Pharma and are not likely to accept a mandated vaccine quietly .\nAs we wrap up our investigation into Bill Gates and consider his ulterior motives , it \u2019 s important to take stock of the company that he keeps and the philosophies which he has promoted .\nThe report , Philanthropic Power and Development : Who shapes the agenda ?\n, also provides an important background on the origins of modern philanthropy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ influence global health , food , and agriculture policy .\nThe researchers outline the role of the Rockefeller and Carnegie dynasties in the creation of American philanthropy : Ironically , the formation of the Rockefeller Foundation sounds eerily similar to Gates \u2019 own story of facing antitrust and monopoly accusations during his time at Microsoft and then going on to found the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation as a way to rewrite history and create a hero persona around himself .\nPhilanthropy and tax evasion are not the only commonalities between Bill Gates @ @ @ @ @ @ @ records , Gates is related to the Rockefeller family via Nelson Rockefeller , a former Vice President of the U.S .\nHowever , the connections go beyond being associated by distant relatives .\nBoth the Rockefeller Foundation and he Gates Foundation seemingly \u201c predicted \u201d a scenario much like the pandemic unfolding in front of our eyes .\nOn October 18 , 2019 , the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation partnered with the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security and the World Economic Forum on a high-level pandemic exercise known as Event 201 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Agenda Contributor \u201d for the WEF and has donated to Johns Hopkins .\nEvent 201 simulated how the world would respond to a coronavirus pandemic which swept around the planet .\nThe simulation imagined 65 million people dying , mass lockdowns , quarantines , censorship of alternative viewpoints under the guise of fighting \u201c disinformation , \u201d and even floated the idea of arresting people who question the pandemic narrative .\nCoincidentally , one of the players involved with Event 201 was Dr. Michael Ryan , the head of the World Health Organization @ @ @ @ @ @ @ containment and treatment of COVID-19 .\nRyan called for looking into families to find potentially sick individuals and isolate them from their families .\nThe Rockefeller Foundation imagined a similar scenario in 2010 as part of their document , \u201c Scenarios for the Future of Technology and International Development.\n\u201d This document includes a scenario called \u201c Lockstep , \u201d which describes a pandemic sweeping the world and resulting in more authoritarian control from governments in developed countries .\nThe document also describes the response to the pandemic as follows : In the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u201c scanners using advanced functional magnetic resonance imaging ( fMRI ) technology become the norm at airports and other public areas to detect abnormal behavior that may indicate \u201c antisocial intent.\n\u201d Interestingly , the Transportation Security Administration recently announced plans to check temperatures at American airports .\nThe document goes on to describe how , eventually , the people of the world tire of the control and civil unrest would begin : While it might be convenient to dismiss Event 201 and Lock Step as a coincidence , it would be short-sighted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Gates and Rockefeller Foundations are heavily involved in funding the global health industry .\nWhile theories abound over whether the COVID-19 pandemic was planned or engineered in some way , as if to mimic the plans discussed in Event 201 and Lock Step , hard evidence is currently lacking .\nStill , we should not dismiss them completely .\nThe Gates and Rockefeller dynasties are also united by their common interest in eugenics , the debunked science which promoted the idea that people of \u201c good birth \u201d should be encouraged to reproduce @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should be discouraged from breeding or sterilized altogether .\nThe science was developed by Francis Galton as a strategy for improving the human race .\nThe idea was extremely popular in America before the Nazis embraced the doctrine and took it to the extreme .\nEugenics was also extremely popular with the Rockefeller family .\nA report from the Hudson Institute notes , \u201c the first American foundations were deeply immersed in eugenics the effort to promote the reproduction of the fit and to suppress the reproduction of the unfit.\n\u201d The report @ @ @ @ @ @ @ American philanthropists believed in \u201c philanthropic eugenics , \u201d the idea that they could use their money to create foundations which would promote the philosophy of eugenics .\nThe Rockefeller Foundation and family helped fund researchers at the Kaiser Wilhelm Institutes in Germany who were involved in the Nazi sterilization programs , funded the Eugenics Records Office , and many other programs promoting population control .\nIn 1952 , after the Nazis eugenics experiments were widely known , John D. Rockefeller III helped created the Population Council to promote eugenics without the baggage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Showing Up for Life , Bill Gates \u2019 father , William H. Gates II , wrote about his admiration for the Rockefeller \u2019 s and their philanthropy : It appears that Gates II was a supporter of the Rockefellers \u2019 eugenics philosophy as he served as the head of Planned Parenthood for a time .\nPlanned Parenthood was funded in part by a $ 1.5 million donation from the Rockefeller-created Population Council .\nGates II was preceded at Planned Parenthood by Alan Guttmacher , who simultaneously served as the Director of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eugenics may have gone back three generations to Bill Gates \u2019 grandfather , William H. Gates , as the American Eugenics Society did have a member by the name of \u201c William H. Gates \u201d in the 1920s .\nThe William H. Gates listed on the AES roster was listed as \u201c professor \u201d and there is a professor William H. Gates from Louisiana State University but there is not yet evidence that Gates \u2019 grandfather is the same William H. Gates .\nRegardless , the present-day Gates family has a habit of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nIn December 2001 , William H. Gates received the inaugural \u201c Andrew Carnegie Medals of Philanthropy \u201d for his charity work .\nGates Sr. received his award alongside Walter H. and Leonore Annenberg on behalf of the Annenberg Foundation , Brooke Astor , Irene Diamond , David and Laurance S. Rockefeller on behalf of the Rockefeller family , George Soros and Ted Turner .\nAlthough Bill Gates is not pictured , the Carnegie Corporation mentions that the senior Gates was representing the \u201c Gates family.\n\u201d More recently , in 2010 Bill @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an event which was described by the corporate media as \u201c They \u2019 re called the Good Club \u2013 and they want to save the world.\n\u201d The Guardian reported : The Guardian also notes that Rockefeller , Gates , and Buffet organized the meeting .\nThe Wall Street Journal reported that the meeting was focused on slowing population growth , a euphemism for eugenics .\nThe appearance of Ted Turner at both the 2001 meeting and the 2010 meeting should not be a surprise as he has also been a vocal proponent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be noted that despite the denials from Bill Gates , he was also an associate of sexual predator Jeffrey Epstein .\nTLAV writer Whitney Webb previously documented the relationship and the attempts to conceal it .\nCoincidentally , Epstein was also exposed as a proponent of eugenics .\nWill The Real Bill Gates Stand Up ?\nNow that we have arrived to the end of this investigation into the lives , finances , and history of Bill Gates , we must stop to reflect on his motivations .\nIs Bill Gates the lovable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from COVID-19 ?\nIs he the financier of dangerous vaccine trials ?\nIs he motivated by a desire to help humanity or is he motivated by a debunked philosophy or race science and eugenics ?\nIf we are to judge an individual by the company they keep , by the projects they finance , and by the words they say , then it should be clear that the Gates family has a history of promoting and supporting eugenics .\nArmed with this knowledge we can take a fresh look at Bill Gates \u2019 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ might have motives which are very different from his public statements .\nThe fact is that Bill Gates runs in elite circles where the promotion of eugenics , population control , sterilization , and other social engineering tactics are the norm .\nThis man is being propped up in front of the world as the hero we desperately need to free us from the grips of the COVID-19 pandemic .\nIf his PR stunts and philanthropy succeed in convincing the people that he is the savior they have been searching for , we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ contact tracing surveillance , digital certificates to travel , forced vaccinations , tracking and restrictions of all movement , and forced quarantines .\nThe only thing that stands between Gates and his agenda are the free hearts

"activistpost", "title": "AB 5 \u2013 California Drivers Fight for Liberty", "content": "Yesterday I saw an advertisement about this ballot that is trying to undo AB 5 , a California law that would violate the rights and liberties of drivers of app-based services like Uber Eats , Lyft , DoorDash and the like to operate as independent contractors .\nThese drivers are providing services that the oh so benevolent ( not ! )\nand socialist state government of California under Gruesome Gavin Newsom is unjustly making more expensive , while failing in the fundamental duty of government to protect people \u2019 s rights and liberties at all costs .\nAs someone who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ liberty and non-coercion prevail rather than socialism and coercion , I must say that OVERALL , I support the ballot .\nHowever , there are problematic parts of it , which I \u2019 ll detail below , but let me first start with the good parts that I enthusiastically support \u2013 they are stated below and can also be found here : Protect app-based work that is essential during these uncertain times .\nThe ballot measure would protect the right of app-based rideshare and delivery drivers to work as independent contractors if certain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ control over their own hours and when , where , how long they work , and the ability to work for multiple platforms .\nIt would preserve access to earning opportunities for struggling Californians needing to supplement lost income or jobs .\nThe measure would provide for : \u2022 Zero tolerance for alcohol and drug offenses \u2022 App-based delivery services that provide Californians convenient access to food , medicine , grocery and package delivery services , while providing small businesses like restaurants , grocers and retailers new customers ; and \u2022 Rideshare services @ @ @ @ @ @ @ improve mobility for seniors and the disabled , and provide new transportation options for families who can not afford a vehicle .\nWhy do I support the above-described measures of the ballot ?\nPlease find my reasoning below : See : 177 Different Ways to Generate Extra Income I support these measures above because they protect the rights , the fundamental individual liberties , of ride-share companies and the drivers to offer services with flexibility while preserving the right of customers to accept the flexibility-based services offered by drivers .\nEnsuring safety with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and protection from sexual harassment are within reason as they aren \u2019 t costly above and beyond regular business operating expenses .\nFor these reasons , I don \u2019 t support these following measures currently on the ballot : The measure requires app-based rideshare and delivery network companies to offer new protections and benefits for drivers , including : \u2022 Earnings Guarantee , including : \u2022 Drivers always receive at least an amount equal to 120 % of minimum wage , plus 30 cents per mile compensation toward expenses , with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on how much drivers can make .\n\u2022 Health care contribution equal to 100 percent of the average employer payment toward a Covered California Plan , or $ 367 per month to a driver on average .\n\u2022 Drivers start earning this amount at 15 hours per week and reach the full amount at 25 hours per week \u2022 The health care provision in the ballot measure is more generous than state and federal laws , which only require health care to be provided to those working more than 30 hours per week @ @ @ @ @ @ @ workers .\n\u2022 A cap on driver hours per day to prevent sleepy driving Why don \u2019 t I support these measures ?\nPlease see my reasoning below : Forcing the rideshare companies to bear the heavy expenses of earnings guarantees and health insurance to drivers violates the rights of the companies .\nAdditionally , imposing these expenses on the companies , rather than letting drivers purchase their own health insurance with their earnings , will result in unintended and undesirable consequences such as higher prices for customers , lower pay for drivers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new drivers from getting on boarded to the network , and/or stifling investment into things that either result in higher pay for drivers or lower prices for customers , just to name a few .\nThe ballot should aim to maximize the benefits of customers , drivers , and rideshare companies , which is why I can not support the above-described measures currently in the ballot .\nRegarding the need for accident , liability , occupational , and other types of insurance , these should not be made mandatory by law of drivers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them of drivers on their respective networks , or if the customers demand drivers to carry such insurance , they can force them to do so by refraining from getting service by those uninsured drivers .\nAnyway , all California drivers , even those that don \u2019 t provide delivery or ridesharing services , are already required by law to carry car insurance .\nThe same concept applies to the cap on driver hours ; customers can filter out getting served by drivers who \u2019 ve driven too many hours , a quantity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ s opinion , by simply avoiding such drivers and selecting drivers that have not driven so many hours .\nThere is absolutely no need for the government to have the power to enforce something like this .\nAlready the government uses its power wrongly , intrusively , and abusively by interfering with the rights of voluntary contract and commerce between rideshare companies , drivers , and customers .\nLet \u2019 s not give them more power to do so , in fact , it is our duty , as people in a free @ @ @ @ @ @ @ abilities and temptations to do so .\nIf they can eliminate the bad parts described above , I pray for the success of this ballot , as I believe everyone should .\nSubscribe to Activist Post for truth , peace , and freedom news .\nBecome an Activist Post

"source": "activistpost", "title": "New Hasty Attempt to Tackle Fake News in Brazil Heavily Strikes Privacy and Free Expression", "content": "The Brazilian Senate rushes to approve a draft bill that seriously undermines privacy and free expression .\nNamed as the \u201c Fake News Law , \u201d PLS 2630/2020 aims to tackle an intricate problem , whose responses must be carefully designed in a democratic and participatory manner .\nContrary to the Brazilian Civil Rights Framework for the Internet , law approved in 2014 with broad and intense social participation , PLS 2360/2020 is marked by a rushed debate , during a time of exceptional operation of legislative activities due to the COVID pandemic .\nAfter an alarming and not officially @ @ @ @ @ @ @ put to a vote last Tuesday , the bill \u2019 s original author presented a substitute text , and there are other proposals under discussion .\nSeeking to curb the spread of disinformation online , the bill lacks precision to avoid abusive reporting and interpretations .\nIt also creates criminal offenses , prohibitions , and obligations that hamper legitimate ways of expressing ourselves online and severely expose users \u2019 communications .\nWe want to emphasize some of the bill \u2019 s most concerning points : Providers Are Required to Retain the Chain of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and private messaging applications would be obliged to keep the chain of all communications that have been forwarded tracking all its nodes , regardless of the distribution of the content was done maliciously at the source or along the chain .\nThis is a massive data retention obligation , which affects millions of users instead of only those investigated for an illegal act .\nAlthough Brazil already has obligations for retaining specific communications metadata , the proposed rule goes further .\nKnowing the chain of forwarded communications implies that a certain content is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and it will be used exactly for tracing back the origin of a content that is already known .\nThis obligation erodes key protections afforded by end-to-end encrypted applications , aimed at exactly ensuring confidential communications .\nAnd there are critical reasons to protect those .\nThe communication between journalists and their sources , law enforcement authorities discussing sensitive aspects of investigations against a powerful politician , communities organizing ways to resist harassment , and several more .\nPiecing together a communication chain may reveal highly sensitive aspects of individuals , groups , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of them is actually involved with illegitimate activities .\nThe avenues are open for abuse .\nThe proposal requires a warrant before providers hand over the chain of metadata , but this access is not limited to criminal cases .\nAny interested party could require this information to a judge in a civil suit .\nIn addition , the parameters that a judge should consider to authorize the measure provide a much lower barrier than the factual basis established in Brazil \u2019 s Telephone Interception Law .\nThe stakes are higher for vulnerable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ journalists , particularly in local contexts of dispute and harassment .\nRecall that even with the stronger protections of the Interception Law , the Inter-American Court of Human Rights has condemned Brazil for illegal interception against social movement \u2019 s representatives where safeguards were not properly fulfilled .\nOn the other hand , the accurate reconstruction of the forwarding chain has its own challenges .\nThe use of techniques such as hash-matching for complying with this obligation is not immune to circumvention , since changing any bit of the message would lead to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u2019 s tracking .\nFurthermore , this obligation disregards the way more decentralized communication architectures work .\nIt assumes that application providers are always able to identify and distinguish forwarded and non-forwarded content , and also able to identify the origin of a forwarded message .\nThis depends in practice on the service architecture and on the relation between the application and the service .\nWhen the two are independent it is common that the service can not differentiate between forwarded and non-forwarded content , and that the application does not store the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ s device .\nThis architectural separation is very traditional in Internet services and while it is less common today in the most used private messaging applications , the obligation would limit the use of XMPP or similar solutions .\nThe obligation could also negatively impact open source messaging applications , designed to afford users not only to understand but also to change their functionalities .\nEven not restricting specific content , the proposal prohibits \u201c inauthentic accounts \u201d and \u201c unidentified automated accounts , \u201d the latter when the user does not inform @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the general public .\nAt least for \u201c inauthentic accounts , \u201d this would entail a legal general monitoring obligation of users \u2019 identity , with severe implications for privacy and free expression .\nWhat \u2019 s more , the broad definitions proposed are broad and endanger legitimate speech .\nAccounts commonly combine automated and non-automated actions .\nThe proposal seeks to curb malicious \u201c cyborg \u201d activities , but strikes a myriad of other uses .\nCompanies and large organizations have tools to help manage social networks that allow different employees @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the account and its credentials \u2014 which does not turn this account into a bot .\nMore critically , many civil society campaigns use tools that allow users

would be mere opinion if not based on fact and science \u2014 albeit , some ignored fact and science .\nFact includes history .\nFrom a general standpoint , even a brief review of proven government-agency histories should evoke at least a moment \u2019 s hesitation before unquestioning faith becomes immovable object .\nFor example , please recall what we were , and were not , told

agencies are controlled by corporate influence ( tool of power ) , see The Cancer Industry , by Ralph Moss .\nOne of many documented accounts .\nMoss @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cancer establishment\u2026 .\nHe

military ) operate for Elite and corporate interests , see Kevin Phillips \u2019 American Dynasty .\nOr Marine Maj.

\u2019 s another post , but the curious reader can see a detailed , referenced analysis in the section Confirmed COVID Cases ?\nin \u201c 5G \u201d Hysteria Times Corona Hysteria Equals Hysteria Squared .\nThe Dashboard slider above the righthand section reviews pandemic history .\nLockdowns were fairly well established globally by 3/15 .\nPrior to that , mortality was mostly around 4 % .\nFrom that time , the slider shows incidence and mortality rising .\nSee Wikipedia for \u201c Influenza Pandemic.\n\u201d Scroll down to the colored chart and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fatality rate and Pandemic severity \u201d figures .\nFlu \u2019 s always hit hundreds of millions in the time Corona has had .\nHave we seen official or media forthrightness on this ?\nOr at least policy sanity based on it ?\nPlease note the stats for Asian and Hong Kong flu \u2019 s .\nEach at around 500 million cases and 1-4 million deaths .\nNo lockdowns .\nJust as dead , however .\nEven with raw tracker data , even after 5-6 months , Corona has just passed the mid-range of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 650,000 ) at c. 400,000 \u2014 time of writing \u2014 and about 6 % mortality , infecting c. 7 million .\nFor 2019-nCoV , prestigious medical journal Lancet reported 15 % mortality in China very early on ( Jan. 2020 ) .\nIn March , Anthony Fauci said 1 % mortality , while the WHO was saying 3.4 % .\nMortality dropped due to \u201c estimates \u201d of many asymptomatic \u201c infections.\n\u201d There \u2019 s also uncertainty and guesswork about alleged spread from these \u201c carriers.\n\u201d One study proved flawed \u2013 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nOne note though , is need for distinction between asymptomatic , period ( not yet officially understood ) and pre-symptomatic .\nMost people have probably heard the story of unused emergency field hospitals .\nBut \u2018 good thing \u2019 we were prepared , eh ?\nAfter the fact , that is : Pharma favoritism at FDA ( see the \u201c disclaimers \u201d on many well-researched natural products ) helps ensure that people are not being fully informed/taught how to become resistant to infectious illness , or illness in general ( nor are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) .\nBecause : This is all hyped , for one thing , to sell the poison needle ?\nAccording to the world-renowned Cochrane group : Injected influenza vaccines probably have a small protective effect against influenza and [ influenza-like illness ] ( moderate-certainty evidence ) , as 71 people would need to be vaccinated to avoid one influenza case , and 29 would need to be vaccinated to avoid one case of ILI .\nI wouldn \u2019 t even give it \u201c small.\n\u201d One percent effective for flu , and it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ questionable claims of efficacy ?\nThis CDC page says , \u2026recent studies show that flu vaccination reduces the risk of flu illness by between 40 % and 60 % among the overall population during seasons when most circulating flu viruses are well-matched to the flu vaccine .\nNote the qualification , \u201c when well matched \u201d ( hyphen incorrect \ud83d\ude42 ) Isn \u2019 t that a little backwards ?\nShouldn \u2019 t the vaccine be matched to the virus ?\nAt any rate , a far cry from the Cochrane conclusion , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nWhile health officials and people respond with blind obedience to the voice of authority , for $ billions annually to its masters .\nNow we hear from authority that one \u2019 s own antibodies to Corona are no guarantee of immunity .\nThis prepares us under fear for \u2018 vaccine-need \u2019 .\nVaccines are \u2018 tested \u2019 and declared \u2018 effective \u2019 by two means , one of which uses \u201c \u2026antibody response to the vaccine as measured in the laboratory.\n\u201d Antibodies appear some weeks after injection .\nFlu-type viruses mutate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ match.\n\u201d But can anyone say why vaccine-induced antibodies are better than our own ?\nMy answer : Medical arrogance .\nAnother : Ruthless Pharma avarice .\nAnyone ?\nAccording to this extraordinary , allegedly AI-driven , dynamic interactive visualization , \u201c As of May 20 , 2020 , 14,321 different strains have been found from worldwide COVID-19 viruses.\n\u201d You \u2019 d have to be a pro to fathom and vet or refute it , but it \u2019 s a wonder to behold .\nJust doing simple arithmetic , that \u2019 s @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nThe other CDC \u2018 test \u2019 actually operates on the presumption that the vaccine works .\nNo properly controlled study has been , or even can be , ethically done to prove efficacy ( exposing the vaccinated to known virus in a controlled environment , with unvaccinated controls ) .\nThere is no data point in the current method , meaning it \u2019 s impossible to know who would or would not have gotten it anyway .\nEveryone knows there \u2019 s a frequently emotional controversy about vaccine safety and effectiveness .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ anti-vaxxer \u2019 ( the \u2018 dirty \u2019 term for denigrative political use , like \u2018 conspiracy theorist \u2019 and \u2018 climate denier \u2019 ) , I prefer to avoid that discussion , instead focusing on the fundamental illogic of vaccination , based on how immune function works according to standard textbooks : OK , Let \u2019 s Talk Immunity .\nOne important point is that even if vaccines were logical , and even if they were safe and effective , they could not confer health/wellness , which claim is often made for them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the absence of overt or diagnosed disease .\nNot even our wondrous immune function ( medically unmolested ) can confer wellness by itself .\nMoreover , even if vaccines worked , illness they might cause in the long term is not being considered or tracked .\nFor instance short term , effect on the brain ( author is a neurosurgeon ) .\nCOVID mortality rate dropped due to \u201c estimates \u201d of many \u201c infections \u201d with no symptoms .\nAnd most cases are mild , while patient mortality profile comes very close @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pre-existing conditions .\nAs a holistic wellness consultant , I suggest that an added health assault other than flu would also have a mortal effect on the fragile .\nBut as long as there \u2019 s a flu virus involved , well\u2026 Best example , Spanish Flu was bacterial pneumonia .\nFact : We are cowering before , and being controlled by , official policy that doesn \u2019 t jibe with official figures .\nThis kind of irony tickles the ultimate perpetrators of this fraud .\nPropaganda \u00fcber reality .\nThere \u2019 s @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a compliance ritual that interferes with natural social connection and interaction \u2013 something also under attack by smartphones .\nAll things considered , it \u2019 s become rather obvious to all but the unquestioningly faithful immovable objects \u2013 concerning the economy-devastating and life-wrecking , mostly ineffective , unused in far worse scenarios , lockdown hyper-reaction to COVID \u2013

directly linked to the impact of technology , it involves the gradual appearance of a more controlled and directed society .\nSuch a society would be dominated by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would rest on allegedly

"content": "Many Swiss citizens DO NOT want 5G ( see 1 , 2 ) AND there have been moratoriums already issued in some parts of the country ( see 1 , 2 ) including Geneva .\nThanks to Smart Meter News for this compilation and update on Switzerland : Update 29-2 : In Switzerland , municipalities and cantons are battling against providers and the federal government that has auctioned the broadcasting licenses .\nThe municipalities and cantons argue that the adaptive 5G antennas emit at much higher peak power so that they do not comply with the current exposure limits , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ states that the licenses have been auctioned technology-neutral .\nUpdate 28-2 : The Canton of Geneva introduces a three-year moratorium on 4G+ and 5G .\nThe amendment to the law stipulates that any new installation will be subject to a permit during this period .\nThis applies to both \u2018 4G+ \u2019 a.k.a .\n1st wave 5G , operating at the 3.5 Gigahertz frequency , and 5G at 26 Gigahertz , which has not yet been rolled out in Switzerland .\nThe amendment aims to respond to the growing concern of the population @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Greens in the Geneva Grand Council .\n\u201c The precautionary principle prevails in view of the absence of independent studies on the effects of this technology on health and biodiversity , \u201d he said .\nGeneva is thus following in the footsteps of the canton of Neuch\u00e2tel , which declared a moratorium in January .\nUpdate 13-2 : Mobile World Live writes that a representative of the Bafu , the Swiss Federal Office for the Environment , says that the FT report that the cantons have been requested by the Bafu to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ correct .\n\u201c The letter to the cantons rather describes how they can proceed with allowing 5G until the Bafu \u2019 s enforcement aid on adaptive antennas is available.\n\u201d In a letter to the country \u2019 s cantonal authorities at the end of January , the Swiss Federal Office for the Environment Bafu asked for a postponement on the commissioning of new 5G transmission masts , writes the Financial Times .\nThe Bafu is responsible for establishing safety criteria against which radiation emissions can be assessed .\nThe Bafu has said that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ without further testing the impact of 5G radiation .\nThe environmental agency writes that it is \u201c not aware of any global standard \u201d that could be used to assess recommendations.\n\u201d Therefore , the Bafu will investigate in depth the exposure caused by 5G antennas , if possible in real operational conditions .\nThis work will take some time , \u201d the agency said .\nWithout new criteria , cantons can only grant licenses for 5G infrastructure under the existing radiation exposure guidelines , which virtually exclude the use of 5G , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nIn Switzerland , where the rollout of 1st wave 5G , operating at the 3.5 Gigahertz frequency , has already started , health complaints are being reported by people living close to the new transmitters , writes Physicians for Safe Technology .\nSeveral cantons have already imposed their own voluntary moratoria because of uncertainty about health risks .\nThe new 5G communication technology means that individuals are exposed to higher frequencies and more concentrated radiation beams for short periods of time .\nThe Bafu will have to determine which legal standards apply @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u2019 s largest mobile operator , said it understood \u201c the fears often expressed about new technologies.\n\u201d The company states \u201c there is no evidence that radiation from the antennas within the limits affects human health.\n\u201d However , this laconic position is contradicted by the insurance company Swiss Re , which excludes from cover all damage caused by electromagnetic radiation .\nThe Swiss Medical Association has issued an opinion on 5G , arguing that the strictest legal principles should be applied because of the unanswered questions about the potential of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ system , or even cancer .\nSwitzerland already has an anti-5G lobby , with recent protests against the rollout in Bern , Zurich and Geneva .\nFive \u2018 citizens \u2019 initiatives \u2019 \u2013 proposals for legally binding referendums on the use of 5G \u2013 have already been launched in Switzerland .\nTwo of these have already been formalised and are in the process of collecting the 100,000 signatures needed to cast a national vote that will allow the constitution of Switzerland to be amended .\nThe first will hold telecom operators legally liable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ transmitters , unless the contrary can be proven .\nThe second proposes strict limits on radiation from masts and will give the local population a right of veto over all new deployment plans in their area .\nOpposition to 5G is WORLDWIDE .\nCities AND countries have taken action to ban , delay , halt , and limit installation as well as issue moratoriums ( see 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 , 6 , 7 , 8 .\n9 , 10 ) .\nSince 2017 , doctors and scientists @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Earth as well as in space ( see 1 , 2 , 3 ) .\nSince 2018 , there have been reports of people and animals becoming sick after 5G has been turned on ( see 1 .\n2 , 3 , 4 ) .\nBecome an Activist Post Patron for $ 1 per month at Patreon .\nOf course , other sources of wireless AND Electromagnetic Radiation ( aka \u201c Electrosmog \u201d ) can cause symptoms and illness too .\nThis includes Bluetooth , cell phone radiation and WiFi .\nHealth and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on top of already dangerous levels of \u201c

, was completely defunded by Google .\nHere \u2019 s what Zero Hedge had to say about the issue .\nYou see , the way it works is this .\nAd networks bid on advertisements and , based on statistics available through Google @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that contract with the ad networks .\nThis is how my site and many other high-volume websites get the bulk of their advertising revenue .\nKeep in mind it \u2019

their site funded but only if they removed their comments section entirely .\nSo not only do they have to change their reporting , but they also have to silence their readers .\nYou may be thinking that it sounds like they caved \u2013 but you can not run a large website without revenue unless you \u2019 re independently wealthy and you don \u2019 t mind just throwing money down a well never to be seen again .\nMost site owners @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u2019 s a nerve-wracking time to be in this business .\nI debated for several days whether or not to write this article because my head could be on the chopping block next .\nMy livelihood and that of the people who work with me are at risk .\nBut if we of the independent media don \u2019 t speak up , who will ?\nHow can we do nothing while the entire conversation is being taken over by radical elements with which many Americans do not agree ?\nThe independent media is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nGeorge Orwell wrote these chillingly prophetic words in his novel 1984 .\nWhen we of the independent media are gone , Big Brother is totally in charge of all the information you receive .\nThis will be the information on which you make your decisions , the information that influences your opinions and the opinions of others , the only \u201c truth \u201d there is , even if the information is inaccurate and biased .\nAmericans can only hold one opinion now .\nAmericans continue to be silenced or to be bullied @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they voted for , forced to affiliate with groups that they may not actually support , or fall victim to a virtual mob during an internet witch hunt .\nAll because they dare , in America , alleged land of the free , to disagree with an opinion that is treated as fact .\nYou may recall after President Trump was elected how horribly anyone who voted for him was treated .\nHeaven forbid a person was to wear a red MAGA hat in public because to do so was risking a beating @ @ @ @ @ @ @ world so extreme that our opinions could mean the difference between life and death in the workplace and on the streets .\nIf you don \u2019 t support groups like Antifa or the Occupy movement , you \u2019 re considered a \u201c far-right extremist.\n\u201d That \u2019 s the moniker used to describe Zero Hedge in most of the news coverage about their defunding .\nFor the record , I \u2019 m not even sort of \u201c right \u201d and I \u2019 m definitely not \u201c far-right.\n\u201d I don \u2019 t support @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any extremist groups .\nI weigh my opinions based on my personal ethics .\nSome of them may fall in line with the left , some may fall in line with the right , but I do not align myself with any groups .\nMy opinions are entirely my own .\nFreedom of speech is one of our most sacred rights in this country .\nThat includes the freedom for those with differing opinions to speak , have platforms , and hold some of the microphones .\nSilencing these websites through insidiously getting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ CNN , for example , has been proven to be exceptionally biased time and time again , even going so far as to try and swing the last election for Hillary Clinton .\nIt \u2019 s an undisputed fact that one of their employees colluded with her before the presidential debate .\nRegardless of that , I don \u2019 t think they should be defunded .\nI think that they should be able to continue to operate and so should their opposition .\nThat \u2019 s how you have a balance in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is how we have balance in our nation .\nHere \u2019 s what Tucker Carlson had to say about the silencing of Americans .\nA few days ago , Tucker Carlson of Fox News tackled this topic .\nAnd yes , Fox News , just like every other network , has a bias .\nWe must all face the reality that days of unbiased journalism are over and every piece is an opinion piece .\nAnd even that wouldn \u2019 t be so bad if we were presented with the full range of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that \u201c our opinions qualify as crimes ?\n\u201d And he \u2019 s also right when he talks about how our information is being controlled .\nIt doesn \u2019 t matter if you personally use Google or not .\nWhat does matter is this : That \u2019 s a whole lot of people who are getting their opinions from one company .\nThat \u2019 s a whole lot of power .\nAnd that power is being misused to silence opposing points of view and to make it seem like nearly all Americans support @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , this is untrue .\nBut the media and the internet have taken control of reality and they \u2019 re presenting us with a reality of their own ideals .\nWe are at an incredibly dangerous turning point right now and everything we hold dear about America is at risk .\nIf you \u2019 re looking ahead and the future looks bright , that might

( June 19 , 2020 ) \u2013 Yesterday , the New Jersey Assembly passed a bill to decriminalize possession of small amounts of marijuana despite federal prohibition .\nA coalition of 12 Democrats introduced Assembly Bill 1897 ( A1897 ) in January .\nAs passed by the Assembly , the legislation would decriminalize possession and distribution of up to 2 ounces of marijuana , making it a civil infraction similar to a traffic ticket .\nInstead of criminal charges , the offense would carry a punishment of a $ 50 fine .\nUnder current law , marijuana @ @ @ @ @ @ @ months in jail and a $ 1,000 fine .\nAccording to NORML , New Jersey police annually make over 30,000 marijuana-related arrests , among the highest of any state in the nation .\nGarden State NORML Executive Director Charlana McKeithen said the measure would take a solid step forward .\nNo New Jerseyan should have to live in fear of an arrest record and the collateral consequences that are associated with it .\nNew Jersey has a unique opportunity to become a leader in marijuana policy reform in the U.S. As we commemorate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looks forward to working to move the envelope forward by advocating for decriminalizing low-level marijuana arrests immediately , while also investing in the communities most harmed by cannabis criminalization .\nWhile the enactment of A1897 would not end marijuana prohibition in New Jersey , it would drastically reduce prosecution and disincentivize enforcement efforts .\nUnder the federal Controlled Substances Act ( CSA ) passed in 1970 , the federal government maintains complete prohibition of marijuana .\nOf course , the federal government lacks any constitutional authority to ban or regulate cannabis within the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ opinion of the politically connected lawyers on the Supreme Court .\nIf you doubt this , ask yourself why it took a constitutional amendment to institute federal alcohol prohibition .\nDespite federal prohibition , New Jersey legalized medical marijuana in 2010 and expanded the program last year .\nDecriminalization of marijuana would remove yet another layer of laws punishing the possession and use of marijuana in the state , but federal prohibition would remain in effect .\nThis is significant because FBI statistics show that law enforcement makes approximately 99 of 100 marijuana @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nWhen states stop enforcing marijuana laws , they sweep away most of the basis for 99 percent of marijuana arrests .\nBecome an Activist Post Patron for $ 1 per month at Patreon .\nFurthermore , figures indicate it would take 40 percent of the DEA \u2019 s yearly-budget just to investigate and raid all of the dispensaries in Los Angeles \u2013 a single city in a single state .\nThat doesn \u2019 t include the cost of prosecution .\nThe lesson ?\nThe feds lack the resources to enforce marijuana prohibition @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a growing number of states increasingly ignoring federal prohibition , and nullifying it in practice .\nColorado , Washington state , Oregon and Alaska were the first states to legalize recreational cannabis , and California , Nevada , Maine and Massachusetts joined them after ballot initiatives in favor of legalization passed in November 2016 .\nMichigan followed suit when voters legalized cannabis for general use in 2018 .\nVermont became the first state to legalize marijuana through a legislative act in 2018 .\nIllinois followed suit in 2019 .\nWith 33 states including @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feds find themselves in a position where they simply can \u2019 t enforce prohibition anymore .\nThe lesson here is pretty straightforward .\nWhen enough people say , \u2018 No !\n\u2019 to the federal government , and enough states pass laws backing those people up , there \u2019 s not much the feds can do to shove their so-called laws , regulations or mandates down our throats .\nThe push to decriminalize marijuana in New Jersey underscores another important strategic reality .\nOnce a state legalizes marijuana \u2013 even if only in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to eventually expand .\nAs the state tears down some barriers , markets develop and demand expands .\nThat creates

incorrect and \u201c unsafe \u201d speech : Disguised as tolerance , civility and love , political correctness has resulted in the chilling of free speech and the demonizing of viewpoints that run counter to the cultural elite .\nConsequently , college campuses have become hotbeds of student-led censorship , trigger @ @ @ @ @ @ @ light \u201d speech policies targeting anything that might cause someone to feel uncomfortable , unsafe or offended .\nBullying , intimidating speech : Warning that \u201c school bullies become tomorrow \u2019 s hate crimes defendants , \u201d the Justice Department has led the way in urging schools to curtail bullying , going so far as to classify \u201c teasing \u201d as a form of \u201c bullying , \u201d and \u201c rude \u201d or \u201c hurtful \u201d \u201c text messages \u201d as \u201c cyberbullying.\n\u201d Hateful speech : Hate speech\u2014speech that attacks a person @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such as gender , ethnic origin , religion , race , disability , or sexual orientation\u2014is the primary candidate for online censorship .\nCorporate internet giants Google , Twitter and Facebook are in the process of determining what kinds of speech will be permitted online and what will be deleted .\nDangerous , anti-government speech : As part of its ongoing war on \u201c extremism , \u201d the government partnered with the tech industry to establish a task force to counter online \u201c propaganda \u201d by terrorists hoping to recruit support or plan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Obama ) .\nIn this way , anyone who criticizes the government online can

against the threats posed by the government and its cabal of Constitution-destroying agencies and corporate partners .\nThe antidote to intolerance is more tolerance .\nWhat this requires is opening the door to more speech not less , even if that speech is offensive to some .\nUnderstanding that freedom for those in the unpopular minority constitutes the ultimate tolerance in a free society , James Madison , the author of the Bill @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Amendment that protected the \u201c minority \u201d against the majority , ensuring that even in the face of overwhelming pressure , a minority of one\u2014even one who espouses distasteful viewpoints\u2014would still have the right to speak freely , pray freely , assemble freely , challenge the government freely , and broadcast his views in the media freely .\nThe First Amendment is a steam valve .\nIt allows people to speak their minds , air their grievances and contribute to a larger dialogue that hopefully results in a more just world .\nWhen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no one to hear what the people have to say\u2014frustration builds , anger grows and people become more volatile and desperate to force a conversation .\nBy bottling up dissent , we have created a pressure cooker of stifled misery and discontent that is now bubbling over and fomenting even more hate , distrust and paranoia among portions of the populace .\nBy becoming so fearfully polite , careful to avoid offense , and largely unwilling to be labeled intolerant , hateful or closed-minded that we \u2019 ve eliminated words , phrases and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ entered into an egotistical , insulated , narcissistic era in which free speech has become regulated speech : to be celebrated when it reflects the values of the majority and tolerated otherwise , unless it moves so far beyond our political , religious and socio-economic comfort zones as to be rendered dangerous and unacceptable .\nProtest laws , free speech zones , bubble zones , trespass zones , anti-bullying legislation , zero tolerance policies , hate crime laws and a host of other legalistic maladies dreamed up by politicians and prosecutors ( and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ speech with which they might disagree ) have conspired to corrode our core freedoms , purportedly for our own good .\nOn paper\u2014at least according to the U.S. Constitution\u2014we are technically free to speak .\nIn reality , however , we are only as free to speak as a government official\u2014or corporate entities such as Facebook , Google or YouTube\u2014may allow .\nThe end result : free speech is no longer free , and injustice persists .\nSo what we can do to end racial inequality , police brutality , and systemic injustice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the altar of political correctness or adopting violent tactics ?\nStop tiptoeing around , easily offended or afraid to cause offense .\nStop allowing the government and its architects to micromanage your life and curtail your freedoms .\nStop being a pawn in someone else \u2019 s game .\nFind your own voice .\nGive voice to your own outrage .\nSpeak truth to power nonviolently .\nAnd throughout it all , love your enemies and put that love into action .\nThat last point , to love your enemies , is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was the principle that Jesus Christ spoke of most often : \u201c Love your enemies , bless them that curse you , do good to them that hate you , and pray for them that despitefully use you.\n\u201d This principle was also at the core of Martin Luther King Jr. \u2019 s efforts to combat racism and injustice .\nIn fact , King delivered an entire sermon on what it means to love one \u2019 s enemies even when they continue to wrong you .\nKing was not speaking in abstracts .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ having faced down water cannons , police dogs and police brutality , intimidation and prejudice and assassination attempts , still insisted that \u201c mass non-violent resistance based on the principle of love \u201d was his best weapon .\nThe first step in loving one \u2019 s enemies , says King , is to discover the element of good in them .\n\u201c Within the best of us , there is some evil , and within the worst of us , there is some good .\nWhen we come to see this , we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The person who hates you most has some good in him ; even the nation that hates you most has some good in it ; even the race that hates you most has some good in it\u2026 There is an element of goodness that he can never slough off .\nDiscover the element of good in your enemy .\nAnd as you seek to hate him , find the center of goodness and place your attention there and you will take a new attitude.\n\u201d Second , says King , focus on defeating @ @ @ @ @ @ @ caught up in an evil system .\n\u201c Love is greater than like .\nLove is understanding , redemptive goodwill for all men , so that you love everybody , because God loves them .\nYou refuse to do anything that will defeat an individual , because you have agape [ the love of God working in the lives of men ] in your soul .\nAnd here you come to the point that you love the individual who does the evil deed , while hating the deed that the person does .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ says , \u2018 Love your enemy.\n\u2019 This is the way to do it .\nWhen the opportunity presents itself when you can defeat your enemy , you must not do it.\n\u201d Third , says Kings , cut off the chain of hate and the chain of evil in the universe with love .\n\u201c If I hit you and you hit me and I hit you back and you hit me back and go on , you see , that goes on ad infinitum .\nIt just never ends\u2026 And that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it doesn \u2019 t cut it off .\nIt only intensifies the existence of hate and evil in the universe\u2026 Men must see that force begets force , hate begets hate , toughness begets toughness .\nAnd it is all a descending spiral , ultimately ending in destruction for all and everybody.\n\u201d Fourth , says King , hate ends up in tragic , neurotic responses .\n\u201c Hate at any point is a cancer that gnaws away at the very vital center of your life and your existence .\nIt is like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the objective center of your life .\nSo Jesus says love , because hate destroys the hater as well as the hated.\n\u201d Instead , use love to redeem and transform those who would do you harm .\nKing \u2019 s conclusion to his sermon is a timeless message , sent through time , to our present age .\nAs I make clear in my book Battlefield America : The War on the American People , we are still fighting the triple evils of racism , poverty and militarism .\nWe are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the world dominated by corporate greed and political ambition .\nWe are still being manipulated into focusing our anger on flawed individuals rather than working to defeat evil establishments .\nSixty-three years later , King \u2019 s words are still relevant : \u201c Our world is in transition now .\nOur whole world is facing a revolution .\nOur nation is facing a revolution .\nHistory unfortunately leaves some people oppressed and some people oppressors .\nAnd there are \u2026 ways that individuals who are oppressed can deal with their oppression .\nOne @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their oppressors with physical violence and corroding hatred .\nBut there is another way .\nAnd that is to organize mass non-violent resistance based on the principle of love\u2026 This is the only way .\nAnd our civilization must discover that .\nIndividuals must discover that as they deal with other individuals\u2026 [ T ] o a power-drunk generation \u2026 love is the only way\u2026 to a generation depending on nuclear and atomic energy , a generation depending on physical violence\u2026love is the only creative , redemptive , transforming power in the universe\u2026 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of this love somewhere , men of the most recalcitrant bent will be transformed\u2026 because we had the power to love our enemies , to bless those persons that cursed us , to even decide to be good to those persons who hated us , and we even prayed for those persons who despitefully used us .\n\u201d", "author": "Activist Post", "url":

massive databases of users \u2019 real identities , and oblige companies to keep track of our private communications online .\nIt creates demands that disregard Internet key @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , running afoul of innovation , and could criminalize the online expression of political opinions .\nAlthough the initial bill arose as an attempt to address legitimate concerns on the spread of online disinformation , it has opened the door to arbitrary and unnecessary measures , that strike settled privacy and freedom of expression safeguards .\nYou can join the hundreds of other protestors and organizations telling Brazil \u2019 s lawmakers why not to approve this Fake News bill right now .\nHere \u2019 s how the latest proposals measure up : Providers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Forwarded Communications Social networks and any other Internet application that allows social interaction would be obliged to keep the chain of all communications that have been forwarded , whether distribution of the content was done maliciously or not .\nThis is a massive data retention obligation which would affect millions of innocent users instead of only those investigated for an illegal act .\nAlthough Brazil already has obligations for retaining specific communications metadata , the proposed rule goes much further .\nPiecing together a communication chain may reveal highly sensitive aspects of individuals @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even when none are actually involved in illegitimate activities .\nThe data will end up as a constantly-updated map of connections and relations between nearly every Brazilian Internet user : it will be ripe for abuse .\nFurthermore , this obligation disregards the way more decentralized communication architectures work .\nIt assumes that application providers are always able to identify and distinguish forwarded and non-forwarded content , and also able to identify the origin of a forwarded message .\nIn practice , this depends on the design of the service and on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the two are independent it is common that the service provider will not be able to differentiate between forwarded and non-forwarded content , and that the application does not store the forwarding history except on the user \u2019 s device .\nThis architectural separation is traditional in Internet communications , including web browsers , FTP clients , email , XMPP , file sharing , etc .\nAll of them allow actions equivalent to the forwarding of contents or the act of copying and pasting them , where the client application and its functions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ service to which it connects .\nThe obligation would also negatively impact open source applications , designed to let end-users not only understand but also to modify and adapt the functioning of local applications .\nIt Compels Applications to Get All Users \u2019 ID and Cell Phone Numbers The bill creates a general monitoring obligation on users \u2019 identity , compelling Internet applications to require all users to give proof of identity through a national ID or passport , as well as their phone number .\nThis requirement goes in the opposite direction @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the country \u2019 s data protection law which is yet to enter into force .\nA vast database of identity cards , held by private actors , is in no way aligned with the standards of data minimization , purpose limitation and the prevention of risks in processing and storing personal data that Brazil \u2019 s data protection law represents .\nCurrent versions of the \u201c Fake News \u201d Bill do not even ensure the use of pseudonyms for Internet users .\nAs we \u2019 ve said many times before , there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to use a name other than the one they have on their IDs and were born with .\nWomen rebuilding their lives despite the harassment of domestic violence abusers , activists and community leaders facing threats , investigative journalists carrying out sensitive research in online groups , transgender users affirming their identities are just a few of examples of the need for pseudonymity in a modern society .\nUnder the new bill , users \u2019 accounts would be linked to their cell phone numbers , allowing \u2014 and in some cases requiring \u2014 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ track users even more closely .\nAnyone without a mobile number would be prevented from using any social network \u2014 if users \u2019 numbers are disabled for any reason , their social media accounts would be suspended .\nIn addition to privacy harms , the rule creates serious hurdles to speak , learn , and share online .\nThese proposals seriously curb the online expression of political opinions and could quickly lead to political persecution .\nThe bill sets high fines in cases of online sponsored content that mocks electoral candidates or question @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is crucial for democracy and disinformation attempts to disrupt it should be properly tackled , a broad interpretation of the bill would severely endanger the vital work of e-voting security researchers in preserving that trustworthiness and reliability .\nElectoral security researchers already face serious harassment in the region .\nOther new and vague criminal offenses set by the bill are prone to silence legitimate critical speech and could criminalize users \u2019 routine actions without the proper consideration of malicious intent .\nBecome an Activist Post Patron for $ 1 per month at Patreon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of data localization .\nOne of its provisions would force social networks to store user data in a special database that would be required to be hosted in Brazil .\nData localization rules such as this can make data especially vulnerable to security threats and surveillance , while also imposing serious barriers to international trade and e-commerce .\nFinally , as the icing on the cake of a raft of provisions that disregard the Internet \u2019 s global nature , providers that fail to comply with the rules would be subject to a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and disproportionate , curtailing the communications of millions of Brazilians and incentivizing applications to overcompliance in the detriment of users \u2019 privacy , security , and free expression .\nEFF has joined many other organizations across the world calling on the Brazilian parliament to reject the latest version of the bill and stop the fast-track mode that has been adopted .\nYou can also take action against the \u201c Fake News \u201d bill now , with our Twitter campaign aimed at senators of the National Congress .\nVeridiana coordinates EFF \u2019 s activities @ @ @ @ @ @ @ America and the Caribbean , where we work together to reinforce the defense of digital and human rights .\nVeridiana has been involved with telecommunications , media , Internet and human rights issues since 2009 .\nShe has been a member of Brazilian Internet Steering Committee ( CGI.br ) as one of the civil society representatives (

.\nLooting , vandalism , the destruction of public property , intimidation tactics aimed at eliminating anything that might cause offense to the establishment : these tactics of mobs and bullies may work in the short term , but they will only give rise to greater injustices in the long term .\nGeorge Floyd \u2019 s death sparked the flame of outrage over racial injustice and police brutality , but political correctness is creating a raging inferno that threatens to engulf the nation .\nIn Boston @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Christopher Columbus .\nProtesters in Richmond , Va. , used ropes to topple that city \u2019 s Columbus statue , spray-painted it , set it on fire and tossed it into a lake .\nColumbus \u2019 crimes against indigenous peoples throughout the Americas are well known .\nIn San Francisco \u2019 s Golden Gate Park , protesters tore down a statue of Francis Scott Key , who penned \u201c The Star-Spangled Banner.\n\u201d Key was also a slaveholding lawyer who tried to prosecute abolitionists vocally opposing slavery .\nActivists who object to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Elihu Yale , a slave trader , are lobbying to re-name the school .\nStudents at Harvard University want to re-name

culturally sensitive , Land @ @ @ @ @ @ @ packaging the image of a Native American princess that had been featured on its products for a hundred years .\nThe distributors of Aunt Jemima Pancake Syrup , Uncle Ben \u2019 s Rice and Mrs. Butterworth \u2019 s Syrup have also announced plans to re-brand and re-name their products in an effort to avoid perpetuating racist stereotypes .\nCream of Wheat is considering what to do about the smiling black chef that graces its breakfast porridge ( his visage has been criticized for being stereotypically subservient ) .\nNot to be outdone , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ retire the 99-year-old name for its Eskimo Pie frozen confections on a stick because \u201c Eskimo \u201d has been denounced as a racist nomenclature used by \u201c colonizers to Arctic regions to

band has removed \u201c Tara \u2019 s Theme , \u201d the opening orchestral theme from Gone with the Wind , from its musical repertoire .\nWhat is the end sum of all these actions ?\nWhat started as a movement to denounce police brutality in the wake of George Floyd \u2019 s death at the hands of killer cops has become a free-for-all campaign to rid the country of any monument , literal or figurative , to anyone who may have at any time in history expressed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or existed within a racist society .\nThe police state has got us exactly where it wants us : distracted , distraught and divided .\nWhile protesters topple statues of men with racist pasts who are long dead , unarmed Americans continue to be killed by militarized police trained to shoot first and ask questions later .\nWhile activists use their collective might to pressure corporations to rebrand products in a more racially sensitive fashion , the American police state\u2014aided and abetted by the Corporate State\u2014continues to disproportionately target blacks , Hispanics @ @ @ @ @ @ @ correct censorship is attempting to sanitize the public sphere of words and images that denigrate minorities , it is not doing anything to rid hearts and minds of racism .\nAs Rod Serling , creator of the Twilight Zone , concluded in the \u201c Deaths-Head Revisited \u201d episode : In other words , what we need is more speech , more discourse , and a greater understanding of history and the evils perpetrated in the name of conquest , profit and racial supremacy .\nBecause if we bury the mistakes of the past @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fail to at least provide context to the past , we risk allowing the government to repeat those past mistakes\u2014rewritten for a new age\u2014and no one will be the wiser .\nIt has happened already : we have allowed the government strip people of their humanity ; to segregate them into polarized classes ; to treat them as chattel ; to deny them basic human rights ; and to reduce them to figures on a ledger sheet .\nCensoring speech\u2014toppling monuments\u2014kowtowing to political correctness\u2014is not the answer to what ails this nation .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1 per month at Patreon .\nAs long as we focus on words and ignore the systemic injustices that undergird the words , the disease will spread .\nAs long as we continue to allow the most controversial issues of our day\u2014gay rights , abortion , race , religion , sexuality , political correctness , police brutality , et al.\u2014to serve as battlegrounds for those who claim to believe in freedom of speech but only when it favors the views and positions they support , we will all eventually lose .\nSilencing unpopular @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it \u2019 s by shouting them down , censoring them , muzzling them , or criminalizing them\u2014only empowers the controllers of the Deep State .\nConsider some of the kinds of speech being targeted for censorship or outright elimination .\nOffensive , politically incorrect and \u201c unsafe \u201d speech : Disguised as tolerance , civility and love , political correctness has resulted in the chilling of free speech and the demonizing of viewpoints that run counter to the cultural elite .\nConsequently , college campuses have become hotbeds of student-led censorship , trigger @ @ @ @ @ @ @ light \u201d speech policies targeting anything that might cause someone to feel uncomfortable , unsafe or offended .\nBullying , intimidating speech : Warning that \u201c school bullies become tomorrow \u2019 s hate crimes defendants , \u201d the Justice Department has led the way in urging schools to curtail bullying , going so far as to classify \u201c teasing \u201d as a form of \u201c bullying , \u201d and \u201c rude \u201d or \u201c hurtful \u201d \u201c text messages \u201d as \u201c cyberbullying.\n\u201d Hateful speech : Hate speech\u2014speech that attacks a person @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such as gender , ethnic origin , religion , race , disability , or sexual orientation\u2014is the primary candidate for online censorship .\nCorporate internet giants Google , Twitter and Facebook are in the process of determining what kinds of speech will be permitted online and what will be deleted .\nDangerous , anti-government speech : As part of its ongoing war on \u201c extremism , \u201d the government partnered with the tech industry to establish a task force to counter online \u201c propaganda \u201d by terrorists hoping to recruit support or plan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Obama ) .\nIn this way , anyone who criticizes the government online can be considered an extremist and will have their content reported to government agencies for further investigation or deleted .\nThey might even find themselves pulled from their homes , arrested by the police and thrown into a mental hospital for expressing their opposition to government policies , as happened to Marine Brandon Raub .\nThe police state could not ask for a better citizenry than one that carries out its own censorship .\nIt \u2019 s a brilliant ploy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the citizenry remains focused on and distrustful of each other , they \u2019 re incapable of presenting a united front against the threats posed by the government and its cabal of Constitution-destroying agencies and corporate partners .\nThe antidote to intolerance is more tolerance .\nWhat this requires is opening the door to more speech not less , even if that speech is offensive to some .\nUnderstanding that freedom for those in the unpopular minority constitutes the ultimate tolerance in a free society , James Madison , the author of the Bill @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Amendment that protected the \u201c minority \u201d against the majority , ensuring that even in the face of overwhelming pressure , a minority of one\u2014even one who espouses distasteful viewpoints\u2014would still have the right to speak freely , pray freely , assemble freely , challenge the government freely , and broadcast his views in the media freely .\nThe First Amendment is a steam valve .\nIt allows people to speak their minds , air their grievances and contribute to a larger dialogue that hopefully results in a more just world .\nWhen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no one to hear what the people have to say\u2014frustration builds , anger grows and people become more volatile and desperate to force a conversation .\nBy bottling up dissent , we have created a pressure cooker of stifled misery and discontent that is now bubbling over and fomenting even more hate , distrust and paranoia among portions of the populace .\nBy becoming so fearfully polite , careful to avoid offense , and largely unwilling to be labeled intolerant , hateful or closed-minded that we \u2019 ve eliminated words , phrases and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ entered into an egotistical , insulated , narcissistic era in which free speech has become regulated speech : to be celebrated when it reflects the values of the majority and tolerated otherwise , unless it moves so far beyond our political , religious and socio-economic comfort zones as to be rendered dangerous and unacceptable .\nProtest laws , free speech zones , bubble zones , trespass zones , anti-bullying legislation , zero tolerance policies , hate crime laws and a host of other legalistic maladies dreamed up by politicians and prosecutors ( and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ speech with which they might disagree ) have conspired to corrode our core freedoms , purportedly for our own good .\nOn paper\u2014at least according to the U.S. Constitution\u2014we are technically free to speak .\nIn reality , however , we are only as free to speak as a government official\u2014or corporate entities such as Facebook , Google or YouTube\u2014may allow .\nThe end result : free speech is no longer free , and injustice persists .\nSo what we can do to end racial inequality , police brutality , and systemic injustice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the altar of political correctness or adopting violent tactics ?\nStop tiptoeing around , easily offended or afraid to cause offense .\nStop allowing the government and its architects to micromanage your life and curtail your freedoms .\nStop being a pawn in someone else \u2019 s game .\nFind your own voice .\nGive voice to your own outrage .\nSpeak truth to power nonviolently .\nAnd throughout it all , love your enemies and put that love into action .\nThat last point , to love your enemies , is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was the principle that Jesus Christ spoke of most often : \u201c Love your enemies , bless them that curse you , do good to them that hate you , and pray for them that despitefully use you.\n\u201d This principle was also at the core of Martin Luther King Jr. \u2019 s efforts to combat racism and injustice .\nIn fact , King delivered an entire sermon on what it means to love one \u2019 s enemies even when they continue to wrong you .\nKing was not speaking in abstracts .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ having faced down water cannons , police dogs and police brutality , intimidation and prejudice and assassination attempts , still insisted that \u201c mass non-violent resistance based on the principle of love \u201d was his best weapon .\nThe first step in loving one \u2019 s enemies , says King , is to discover the element of good in them .\n\u201c Within the best of us , there is some evil , and within the worst of us , there is some good .\nWhen we come to see this , we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The person who hates you most has some good in him ; even the nation that hates you most has some good in it ; even the race that hates you most has some good in it\u2026 There is an element of goodness that he can never slough off .\nDiscover the element of good in your enemy .\nAnd as you seek to hate him , find the center of goodness and place your attention there and you will take a new attitude.\n\u201d Second , says King , focus on defeating @ @ @ @ @ @ @ caught up in an evil system .\n\u201c Love is greater than like .\nLove is understanding , redemptive goodwill for all men , so that you love everybody , because God loves them .\nYou refuse to do anything that will defeat an individual , because you have agape [ the love of God working in the lives of men ] in your soul .\nAnd here you come to the point that you love the individual who does the evil deed , while hating the deed that the person does .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ says , \u2018 Love your enemy.\n\u2019 This is the way to do it .\nWhen the opportunity presents itself when you can defeat your enemy , you must not do it.\n\u201d Third , says Kings , cut off the chain of hate and the chain of evil in the universe with love .\n\u201c If I hit you and you hit me and I hit you back and you hit me back and go on , you see , that goes on ad infinitum .\nIt just never ends\u2026 And that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it doesn \u2019 t cut it off .\nIt only intensifies the existence of hate and evil in the universe\u2026 Men must see that force begets force , hate begets hate , toughness begets toughness .\nAnd it is all a descending spiral , ultimately ending in destruction for all and everybody.\n\u201d Fourth , says King , hate ends up in tragic , neurotic responses .\n\u201c Hate at any point is a cancer that gnaws away at the very vital center of your life and your existence .\nIt is like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the objective center of your life .\nSo Jesus says love , because hate destroys the hater as well as the hated.\n\u201d Instead , use love to redeem and transform those who would do you harm .\nKing \u2019 s conclusion to his sermon is a timeless message , sent through time , to our present age .\nAs I make clear in my book Battlefield America : The War on the American People , we are still fighting the triple evils of racism , poverty and militarism .\nWe are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the world dominated by corporate greed and political ambition .\nWe are still being manipulated into focusing our anger on flawed individuals rather than working to defeat evil establishments .\nSixty-three years later , King \u2019 s words are still relevant :", "author": "Activist Post", "url":

Progression Of \u201cWoke\u201d Censorship Is Tyranny", "content": "As I have noted in the past , in order to be a conservative one has to stick to certain principles .\nFor example , you have to stand against big government and state intrusions into individual lives , you have to support our constitutional framework and defend civil liberties , and you also have to uphold the rights of private property .\nWebsites are indeed private property , as much as a person \u2019 s home is private property .\nThere is no such thing as free speech rights in another person \u2019 s home , and there is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on a website .\nThat said , there are some exceptions .\nWhen a corporation or a collective of corporations holds a monopoly over a certain form of communication , then legal questions come into play when they try to censor the viewpoints of an entire group of people .\nCorporations exist due to government-sponsored charters ; they are creations of government and enjoy certain legal protections through government , such as limited liability and corporate personhood .\nCorporations are a product of socialism , not free market capitalism ; and when they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ regulation and possible demarcation .\nMany corporations have also received extensive government bailouts ( taxpayer money ) and corporate welfare .\nGoogle and Facebook , for example rake in billions in state and federal subsidies over the course of a few years .\nGoogle doesn \u2019 t even pay for the massive bandwidth it uses .\nSo , it is not outlandish to suggest that if a company receives the full protection of government from the legal realm to the financial realm then they fall under the category of a public service .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ monopolize communication while also being coddled by the government as \u201c too big to fail \u201d , then they become a public menace instead .\nThis is not to say that I support the idea of nationalization .\nOn the contrary , the disasters of socialism can not be cured with even more socialism .\nHowever , monopolies are a poison to free markets and to free speech and must be deconstructed or abolished .\nBeyond corporate monopolies , there is also the danger of ideological monopolies .\nConsider this \u2013 The vast @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the lion \u2019 s share of social media platforms are run by extreme political leftists and globalists that are openly hostile to conservative and moderate values .\nCase in point : Three of the largest platforms on the internet \u2013 Reddit , Twitch , and YouTube just acted simultaneously in a single day to shut down tens of thousands of forums , streamers and video channels , the majority of which espouse conservative arguments which the media refers to as \u201c hate speech \u201d .\nTo be sure , at least a few @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from a position of race superiority .\nHowever , I keep seeing the mainstream media making accusations that all the people being silenced right now deserve it due to \u201c racism \u201d and \u201c calls for violence \u201d , and I have yet to see them offer a single piece of evidence supporting any of these claims .\nBecome an Activist Post Patron for $ 1 per month at Patreon .\nA recent article from the hyper-leftist Salon is a perfect example of the hypocrisy and madness of the social justice left in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Twitch , YouTube And Reddit Punished Trump And Other Racists \u2013 And That \u2019 s A Great Thing For Freedom \u2019 .\nHere are a few excerpts with my commentary : Salon : \u201c Freedom is impossible for everyone when viewpoints prevail that dehumanize anyone .\nAnd it appears that several big social media platforms agree , judging from recent bans or suspensions of racist accounts across YouTube , Twitch , and Reddit.\n\u201d Freedom can not be taken away by another person \u2019 s viewpoint .\nEvery individual has complete control over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ marginalized and no amount of disapproval can silence a person unless they allow it to .\nIf you are weak minded or weak willed , then grow a backbone instead of expecting the rest of the world to stay quiet and keep you comfortable .\nRemember when the political left was the bastion of the free speech debate against the censorship of the religious right ?\nWell , now the leftists have a religion ( or cult ) of their own and they have changed their minds on the importance of open dialogue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are dehumanized \u2014 whether by racism , sexism , classism , ableism , anti-LGBTQ sentiment or any other prejudices \u2014 their voices are diminished or outright silenced , and in the process they lose their ability to fully participate in our democracy .\nWe all need to live in a society where hate is discouraged , discredited and whenever possible scrubbed out completely from our discourse .\nThis doesn \u2019 t mean we should label all ideas as hateful simply because we disagree with them ; to do that runs afoul of President @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u201c In a democracy debate is the breath of life \u201d .\nWhen actual hate enters the dialogue , however , it acts as a toxic smoke in the air of debate , suffocating some voices and weakening the rest.\n\u201d Where do I begin with this steaming pile of woke nonsense ?\nFirst , it \u2019 s impossible to be \u201c dehumanized \u201d by another person \u2019 s opinion of you .\nIf they are wrong , or an idiot , then their opinion carries no weight and should be ignored .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ opinion .\nNo one can be \u201c silenced \u201d by another person \u2019 s viewpoint unless they allow themselves to be silenced .\nIf they are right about you and are telling you something you don \u2019 t want to hear , then that is your problem , not theirs .\nNo one in this world is entitled to protection from other people \u2019 s opinions .\nPeriod .\nIt should not surprise anyone though that leftists are actively attempting to silence all dissent while accusing conservatives of stifling free speech .\nThis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the victim while they seek to victimize .\nThey have no principles .\nThey do not care about being right , they only care about \u201c winning \u201d .\nUnder the 1st Amendment , ALL speech is protected , including what leftists arbitrarily label \u201c hate speech \u201d .\nUnless you are knowingly defaming a specific person or threatening specific violence against a specific person , your rights are protected .\nInterpreting broad speech as a \u201c threat \u201d because of how it might make certain people feel simply will not hold up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at least , it should not hold up\u2026 Political leftists have declared themselves the arbiters of what constitutes \u201c hate speech \u201d , the problem is they see EVERYTHING that is conservative as racist , sexist , misogynistic , etc .\nNo human being or group of human beings is pure enough or objective enough to sit in judgment of what encompasses fair or acceptable speech .\nTherefore , all speech must be allowed in order to avoid tyranny .\nIf an idea is unjust , then by all means , the political @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with their own ideas and arguments .\n\u201c Scrubbing \u201d all opposing ideas from the public discourse is unacceptable , and this is exactly what the social justice movement is attempting to do .\nIf you want to erase these ideas from your own home , or your personal website , then you are perfectly within your rights to do so , but you DO NOT have the right to assert a monopoly on speech and the political narrative .\nGenerally , when a group of zealots is trying to erase opposing ideals @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their own ideals don \u2019 t hold up to scrutiny .\nIf your ideology is so pure and correct in its form , there should be no need to trick the masses into accepting it by scrubbing the internet .\nFinally , America was not founded as a democracy , we are a republic , and with good reason .\nA democracy is tyranny by the majority ; a collectivist hell where power is centralized into the hands of whoever can con 51 % of the population to their side .\nMarxists and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u201d and speak about it often because they think they are keenly equipped to manipulate the masses and form a majority .\nBut , in a republic , individual rights are protected REGARDLESS of what the majority happens to believe at any given time , and this includes the right to free speech .\nIn the same breath , Salon pretends to value free discussion , then calls for the destruction of free speech and opposing ideas in the name of protecting people \u2019 s thin-skinned sensitivities .\nIn other words , free @ @ @ @ @ @ @ s a viewpoint they don \u2019 t like , then it becomes hate speech and must be suppressed .\nSalon : \u201c Reddit referred Salon to a statement explaining , \u201d We committed to closing the gap between our values and our policies to explicitly address hate \u201d and that \u201c ultimately , it \u2019 s our responsibility to support our communities by taking stronger action against those who try to weaponize parts of Reddit against other people.\n\u201d \u201d In other words , they don \u2019 t like conservatives using their platforms @ @ @ @ @ @ @ left is unable to present any valid arguments to defend their beliefs and they are losing the culture war , they are going for broke and seeking to erase all conservatives from their platforms instead .\nThe \u201c hate speech \u201d excuse is merely a false rationale .\nSocial justice warriors stand on top of a dung heap and pretend it \u2019 s the moral high ground .\nSalon : \u201c No one who understands Constitutional law can argue that these corporate decisions violate the First Amendment which only protects speech from government @ @ @ @ @ @ @ University of California , Irvine Law School told Salon by email that \u201c private companies running websites are not subject to being sued for violating the First Amendment .\nThe companies are private actors who can include whatever content they want unless there is a law preventing them from doing so.\n\u201d Again , this is not entirely true .\nCorporations are constructs of government and receive special privileges from government .\nIf corporations form a monopoly over a certain form of communication and they attempt to censor all opposing views from that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by government to prevent destruction of the marketplace .\nAlso , government can rescind the limited liability and corporate personhood of these companies as punishment for violating the public trust .\nAnd finally , any company that relies on taxpayer dollars or special tax break incentives to survive can and should have those dollars taken away when attempting to assert a monopoly .\nYes , there are alternative platforms for people to go to , but what is to stop leftist/globalist monopolies from buying up every other social media and standard media platform @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the past decade ) ?\nWhat is to stop leftist/globalist interests from using the \u201c hate speech \u201d argument to put pressure on ALL other web platforms including service and domain providers to cancel conservatives ?\nFinally , just because something is technically legal does not necessarily make it right .\nCorporations exploit government protection , yet claim they are not subject to government regulation ?\nThe left hates corporate America , yet they happily defend corporations when they are censoring conservatives ?\nThis is insane .\nThe Salon author then goes on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ once a victim of racism ( all SJWs measure personal value according to how much more victimized someone is compared to others ) .\nHis claims are irrelevant to the argument at hand , then he continues\u2026 Salon : \u201c Trump threatening to use the government power to retaliate against those companies , on the other hand , is a threat to both the letter and the spirit of the First Amendment .\nHe and his supporters are not being stopped from disseminating their views on other platforms\u2026 \u201d Here is the only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nAll of my readers know I do not put any faith in Donald Trump to do the right thing , mostly because of the elitists he surrounds himself with in his cabinet .\nWhen it comes down to it , Trump will act in THEIR best interests , not in the public \u2019 s best interests .\nGiving him ( or the FCC ) the power to dictate speech rules on the internet is a bad idea .\nAlso , for those that think the election process still matters , what if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ today and then the political left enters the White House tomorrow ?\nYikes !\nThen we \u2019 ll have no room to complain as they will most certainly flip-flop and use government power to silence their opposition .\nOf course , if the roles were reversed and corporations were deplatforming thousands of social justice forums and videos , the leftists would be screaming bloody murder about \u201c corporate censorship \u201d and \u201c discrimination \u201d .\nFor now , in their minds , racial discrimination = bad .\nPoliticial discrimination = good .\nThe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and an ideological monopoly coupled with a unified corporate monopoly is a monstrosity that can not be tolerated .\nGovernment can and should break up such monopolies without going down the rabbit hole of nationalization .\nYes , we can go to small startup platforms and leave Twitter , Facebook , Reddit , YouTube , etc .\nbehind .\nI have been saying for years that conservatives with the capital should start their own alternative social media .\nIn fact , that is exactly what is finally happening .\nThere has been a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lately .\nI say , let the SJWs have their echo chambers and maybe these companies will collapse .\nGet Woke Go Broke still applies .\nBut , government can no longer protect these corporations , either .\nWith the government raining down bailout cash and corporate welfare on media companies , voting with your feet and your wallet does not have the same effect or send the same message .\nThe future of this situation is bleak .\nI have no doubt that leftists and globalists will attempt to purge ALL conservative @ @ @ @ @ @ @ point of attempting to shut down private conservative websites through service providers .\nThe final outcome of the purge is predictable : Civil war ; an issue I will be discussing in my next article .\nLeftists accuse conservatives of hate , but social justice adherents seem to hate almost everything .\nI don \u2019 t think I \u2019 ve ever witnessed a group of people more obsessed with visiting misery on others , and they will never be satisfied or satiated .\nThat which is normal speech today will be labeled as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ continue to justify its own existence .\nI for one am not going to live my life walking on eggshells around a clique of narcissistic sociopaths .\nCancel culture is mob rule , and mob rule is at its core the true evil here ; far more evil than any mere words spoken by any \u201c white supremacist \u201d on any forum or video ever .\nIf you would like to support the work that Alt-Market

scheduled to make its vote this week on the most recent version of \u201c PLS 2630/2020 \u201d the so-called \u201c Fake News \u201d bill .\nThis new version , supposedly aimed at safety and curbing \u201c malicious coordinated actions \u201d by users of social networks and private messaging apps , will allow the government to identify and track countless innocent users who haven \u2019 t committed any wrongdoing in order to catch a few malicious actors .\nThe bill creates a clumsy regulatory regime to intervene in the technology and policy decisions of both public and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them to institute new takedown procedures , enforce various kinds of identification of all their users , and greatly increase the amount of information that they gather and store from and about their users .\nThey also have to ensure that all of that information can be directly accessed by staff in Brazil , so it is directly and immediately available to their government\u2014bypassing the strong safeguards for users \u2019 rights of existing international mechanisms such as Mutual Legal Assistance Treaties .\nThis sprawling bill is moving quickly , and it comes at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , secure communication technologies are more important than ever to cope with the COVID-19 pandemic , to collaborate and work securely , and to protest or organize online .\nIt \u2019 s also really important for people to be able to have private conversations , including private political conversations .\nThere are many things wrong with this bill , far more than we could fit into one article .\nFor now , we \u2019 ll do a deep dive into five serious flaws in the existing bill that would undermine privacy , expression @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Social Media and Private Messaging Companies to Collect Legal Identification of All Users The new draft of Article 7 is both clumsy and contradictory .\nFirst , the bill ( Article 7 , paragraph 3 ) requires \u201c large \u201d social networks and private messaging apps ( that offer service in Brazil to more than two million users ) to identify every account \u2019 s user by requesting their national identity cards .\nIt \u2019 s a retroactive and general requirement , meaning that identification must be requested for each and every existing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not limited to the identification of a user by a court order , also including when there is a complaint about an account \u2019 s activity , or when the company finds itself unsure of a user \u2019 s identity .\nWhile users are explicitly permitted to use pseudonyms , they may not keep their legal identities confidential from the service provider .\nCompelling companies to identify an online user should only be done in response to a request by a competent authority , not a priori .\nIn India , a similar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the country \u2019 s IT Ministry , although reports indicate that ID verification would be optional .\nIn 2003 , Brazil made SIM card registration mandatory for prepaid cell phones , requiring prepaid subscribers to present a proof of identity , such as their official national identity card , driver \u2019 s license , or taxpayer number .\nArticle 39 of the new draft expands that law by creating new mandatory identification requirements for obtaining telephone SIM cards , and Article 8 explicitly requires private message applications that identify their users via an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the underlying telephone number is deregistered .\nTelephone operators are required to help with this process by providing a list of numbers that are no longer used by the original subscriber .\nSIM card registration undermines peoples \u2019 ability to communicate , organize , and associate with others anonymously .\nDavid Kaye , United Nations \u2019 Special Rapporteur on Freedom of Expression and Opinion have asked states to refrain from making the identification of users a condition for access to digital communications and online services and requiring SIM card registration for mobile users @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Article 7 , the draft remains dangerous to free expression because authorities will still be allowed to identify users of private messaging services by linking a cell phone number to an account .\nThe Brazilian authorities will have to unmask the identity of the internet user by following domestic procedures for accessing such data from the telecom provider .\nInternet users will be obliged to hand over identifying information to big tech companies if Article 7 is approved as currently written , with or without paragraph 3 .\nThe compulsory identification provision is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rights of individuals .\nCountries like China and South Korea have mandated that users register their real names and identification numbers with online service providers .\nSouth Korea used to require websites with more than 100,000 visitors per day to authenticate their identities by entering their resident ID numbers when they use portals or other sites .\nBut South Korea \u2019 s Supreme Court revoked the law as unconstitutional , stating that \u201c the [ mandatory identification ] system does not seem to have been beneficial to the public .\nDespite the enforcement @ @ @ @ @ @ @ illegal or malicious postings online has not decreased.\n\u201d Flaw 2 : Forcing Social Networking and Messaging Companies to Retain Immense Logs of

networks and private messaging applications to retain the chain of all communications that have been \u201c massively forwarded \u201d , for the purpose of potential criminal investigation or prosecution .\nThe new draft requires three months of data storage of the complete chain of communication for such messages , including date and time of forwarding , and the total number of users who

\u2019 s content has reached 1,000 or more users .\nThe service provider is also apparently expected to temporarily retain this data for all forwarded messages during the 15-day period in order to determine whether or not the virality threshold for \u201c massively forwarded \u201d will be met .\nThis provision blatantly infringes on due process rights by compelling providers to retain everyone \u2019 s communication before anyone has committed any legally defined offense .\nThere have also been significant changes to how this text interacts with encryption and with communications \u2019 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their users are doing .\nThese mandatory retention requirements may create an incentive to weaken end-to-end encryption , because end-to-end encrypted services may not be able to comply with provisions requiring them to recognize when a particular message has been independently forwarded a certain number of times without undermining the security of their encryption .\nAlthough the current draft ( unlike previous versions ) does not create new crimes , it requires providers to trace messages before any crime has been committed so the information could be used in the future in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of crimes for specific crimes defined in articles 138 to 140 , or article 147 of the Brazil \u2019 s Penal Code , such as defamation , threats , and cal\u00fania .\nThis means , for example , that if you share a message that denounces corruption of a local authority and it gets forwarded more than 1,000 times , authorities may criminally accuse you of cal\u00fania against your local authority .\nCompanies must limit the retention of personal data to what is reasonably necessary , proportionate to certain legitimate business purposes .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ that is , the principle that any company should minimize its processing of consumer data .\nMinimization is an important tool in the data protection toolbox .\nThis bill goes against that , favoring dangerous big data collection practices .\nFlaw 3 : Banning Messaging Companies from Allowing Broadcast Groups , Even if Users Sign Up Articles 9 and 11 require broadcast and discussion group sizes in private messaging tools to have a maximum membership limit ( something that WhatsApp does today , but that not every communications tool necessarily does or will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to reach mass audiences via private messaging platforms must be strictly limited and controlled , even when those audiences opt in .\nThe vision of the bill seems to be that mass discussion and mass broadcast are inherently dangerous and must only happen in public , and that no one should create forums or media for these interactions to happen in a truly private way , even with clear and explicit consent by the participants or recipients .\nSuppose an organization like an NGO , or a labor union , or a political @ @ @ @ @ @ @ among its whole membership or send its newsletter to all its members who \u2019 ve chosen to receive it .\nIt wouldn \u2019 t be allowed to do this through a tool similar to WhatsApp \u2014 at least once some ( unspecified ) audience size limit was reached .\nPer articles 9 and 11 , the organization would have to use another platform ( not a private messaging tool ) , and so the content would be visible to and subject to the control of its operator .\nFlaw 4 : Forcing Social @ @ @ @ @ @ @ User Logs Available Remotely Article 37 compels large social networks and private messaging apps to appoint legal representatives in Brazil .\nIt also forces those companies to provide remote access to their user databases and logs to their staff in Brazil so the local employees can be directly forced to turn them over .\nThis undermines user security and privacy .\nIt increases the number of employees ( and devices ) that can access sensitive data and reduces the company \u2019 s ability to control vulnerabilities and unauthorized access , not least because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should it be adopted in Brazil , could be replicated by other countries .\nEach new person and each new device adds a new security risk .\nFlaw 5 : No Limitations on Applying this Law to Users Outside of Brazil Paragraphs 1 and 2 of Article 1 provide some jurisdictional exclusions , but all of these are applied at the company level\u2014that is , a foreign company could be exempt if it is small ( less than 2,000,000 users ) or does not offer services to Brazil .\nNone of these limitations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u2019 nationality or location .\nThus , the bill , by its terms , requires a company to create certain policies and procedures about content takedowns , mandatory identification of users , and other topics , which are not themselves in any way limited to people based in Brazil .\nEven if the intent is only to force the collection of ID documents from users who are based in Brazil , the bill neglects to say so .\nThere are many innovative new responses being developed to help cut down on abuses of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through policy responses and technical solutions .\nWhatsApp , for example , already limits the number of recipients of a single forwarded message at a time and shows users that messages were forwarded , viral messages are labeled with double arrows to indicate they did not originate from a close contact .\nHowever , shutting down bad actors can not come at the expense of silencing millions of other users , invading their privacy , or undermining their security .\nTo ensure that human rights are preserved , the Brazilian legislature must reject @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Moving forward , human rights such as privacy , expression , security must be baked into the law from the beginning .\nKatitza Rodriguez is EFF \u2019 s international rights director .\nShe concentrates on comparative

the Invasive, Secretive \u201cBossware\u201d Tracking Workers", "content": "COVID-19 has pushed millions of people to work from home , and a flock of companies offering software for tracking workers has swooped in to pitch their products to employers across the country .\nThe services often sound relatively innocuous .\nSome vendors bill their tools as \u201c automatic time tracking \u201d or \u201c workplace analytics \u201d software .\nOthers market to companies concerned about data breaches or intellectual property theft .\nWe \u2019 ll call these tools , collectively , \u201c bossware.\n\u201d While aimed at helping employers , bossware puts workers \u2019 privacy and security at risk by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gathering information for lawsuits , and using other spying features that go far beyond what is necessary and proportionate to manage a workforce .\nThis is not OK .\nWhen a home becomes an office , it remains a home .\nWorkers should not be subject to nonconsensual surveillance or feel pressured to be scrutinized in their own homes to keep their jobs .\nWhat can they do ?\nBossware typically lives on a computer or smartphone and has privileges to access data about everything that happens on that device .\nMost bossware @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the user does .\nWe looked at marketing materials , demos , and customer reviews to get a sense of how these tools work .\nThere are too many individual types of monitoring to list here , but we \u2019 ll try to break down the ways these products can surveil into general categories .\nThe broadest and most common type of surveillance is \u201c activity monitoring.\n\u201d This typically includes a log of which applications and websites workers use .\nIt may include who they email or message\u2014including subject lines and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ social media .\nMost bossware also records levels of input from the keyboard and mouse\u2014for example , many tools give a minute-by-minute breakdown of how much a user types and clicks , using that as a proxy for productivity .\nProductivity monitoring software will attempt to assemble all of this data into simple charts or graphs that give managers a high-level view of what workers are doing .\nEvery product we looked at has the ability to take frequent screenshots of each worker \u2019 s device , and some provide direct , live @ @ @ @ @ @ @ raw image data is often arrayed in a timeline , so bosses can go back through a worker \u2019 s day and see what they were doing at any given point .\nSeveral products also act as a keylogger , recording every keystroke a worker makes , including unsent emails and private passwords .\nA couple even let administrators jump in and take over remote control of a user \u2019 s desktop .\nThese products usually don \u2019 t distinguish between work-related activity and personal account credentials , bank data , or medical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , reaching into the physical world around a worker \u2019 s device .\nCompanies that offer software for mobile devices nearly always include location tracking using GPS data .\nAt least two services\u2014StaffCop Enterprise and CleverControl\u2014let employers secretly activate webcams and microphones on worker devices .\nThere are , broadly , two ways bossware can be deployed : as an app that \u2019 s visible to ( and maybe even controllable by ) the worker , or as a secret background process that workers can \u2019 t see .\nMost companies we looked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their software either way .\nSometimes , workers can see the software that is surveilling them .\nThey may have the option to turn the surveillance on or off , often framed as \u201c clocking in \u201d and \u201c clocking out.\n\u201d Of course , the fact that a worker has turned off monitoring will be visible to their employer .\nFor example , with Time Doctor , workers may be given the option to delete particular screenshots from their work session .\nHowever , deleting a screenshot will also delete the associated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ credit for the time during which they are monitored .\nWorkers may be given access to some , or all , of the information that \u2019 s collected about them .\nCrossover , the company behind WorkSmart , compares its product to a fitness tracker for computer work .\nIts interface allows workers to see the system \u2019 s conclusions about their own activity presented in an array of graphs and charts .\nDifferent bossware companies offer different levels of transparency to workers .\nSome give workers access to all , or most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have .\nOthers , like Teramind , indicate that they are turned on and collecting data , but don \u2019 t reveal everything they \u2019 re collecting .\nIn either case , it can often be unclear to the user what data , exactly , is being collected , without specific requests to their employer or careful scrutiny of the software itself .\nThe majority of companies that build visible monitoring software also make products that try to hide themselves from the people they \u2019 re monitoring .\nTeramind , Time Doctor , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u2019 s designed to be as difficult to detect and remove as possible .\nAt a technical level , these products are indistinguishable from stalkerware .\nIn fact , some companies require employers to specifically configure antivirus software before installing their products , so that the worker \u2019 s antivirus won \u2019 t detect and block the monitoring software \u2019 s activity .\nThis kind of software is marketed for a specific purpose : monitoring workers .\nHowever , most of these products are really just general purpose monitoring tools .\nStaffCop offers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for monitoring children \u2019 s use of the Internet at home , and ActivTrak states that their software can also be used by parents or school officials to monitor kids \u2019 activity .\nCustomer reviews for some of the software indicate that many customers do indeed use these tools outside of the office .\nMost companies that offer invisible monitoring recommend that it only be used for devices that the employer owns .\nHowever , many also offer features like remote and \u201c silent \u201d installation that can load monitoring software on worker @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their devices are outside the office .\nThis works because many employers have administrative privileges on computers they distribute .\nBut for some workers , the company laptop they use is their only computer , so company monitoring is ever-present .\nThere is great potential for misuse of this software by employers , school officials , and intimate partners .\nAnd the victims may never know that they are subject to such monitoring .\nThe table below shows the monitoring and control features available from a small sample of bossware vendors .\nThis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and may not be representative of the industry as a whole ; we looked at companies that were referred to in industry guides and search results that had informative publicly-facing marketing materials .\nThe worker surveillance business is not new , and it was already quite large before the outbreak of a global pandemic .\nWhile it \u2019 s difficult to assess how common bossware is , it \u2019 s undoubtedly become much more common as workers are forced to work from home due to COVID-19 .\nAwareness Technologies , which owns InterGuard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ base by over 300 % in just the first few weeks after the outbreak .\nMany of the vendors we looked at exploit COVID-19 in their marketing pitches to companies .\nSome of the biggest companies in the world use bossware .\nHubstaff customers include Instacart , Groupon , and Ring .\nTime Doctor claims 83,000 users ; its customers include Allstate , Ericsson , Verizon , and Re/Max .\nActivTrak is used by more than 6,500 organizations , including Arizona State University , Emory University , and the cities of Denver and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do not disclose information about their customers , but claim to serve clients in industries like health care , banking , fashion , manufacturing , and call centers .\nCustomer reviews of monitoring software give more examples of how these tools are used .\nWe don \u2019 t know how many of these organizations choose to use invisible monitoring , since the employers themselves don \u2019 t tend to advertise it .\nIn addition , there isn \u2019 t a reliable way for workers themselves to know , since so much invisible software @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Some workers have contracts that authorize certain kinds of monitoring or prevent others .\nBut for many workers , it may be impossible to tell whether they \u2019 re being watched .\nWorkers who are concerned about the possibility of monitoring may be safest to assume that any employer-provided device is tracking them .\nWhat is the data used for ?\nBossware vendors market their products for a wide variety of uses .\nSome of the most common are time tracking , productivity tracking , compliance with data protection laws , and IP @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be valid : for example , companies that deal with sensitive data often have legal obligations to make sure data isn \u2019 t leaked or stolen from company computers .\nFor off-site workers , this may necessitate a certain level of on-device monitoring .\nBut an employer should not undertake any monitoring for such security purposes unless they can show it is necessary , proportionate , and specific to the problems it \u2019 s trying to solve .\nUnfortunately , many use cases involve employers wielding excessive power over workers .\nPerhaps the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are designed for \u201c productivity monitoring \u201d or enhanced time tracking\u2014that is , recording everything that workers do to make sure they \u2019 re working hard enough .\nSome companies frame their tools as potential boons for both managers and workers .\nCollecting information about every second of a worker \u2019 s day isn \u2019 t just good for bosses , they claim\u2014it supposedly helps the worker , too .\nOther vendors , like Work Examiner and StaffCop , market themselves directly to managers who don \u2019 t trust their staff .\nThese @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to performance metrics derived from their products .\nSome firms also market their products as punitive tools , or as ways to gather evidence for potential worker lawsuits .\nInterGuard advertises that its software \u201c can be silently and remotely installed , so you can conduct covert investigations [ of your workers ] and bullet-proof evidence gathering without alarming the suspected wrongdoer.\n\u201d This evidence , it continues , can be used to fight \u201c wrongful termination suits.\n\u201d In other words , InterGuard can provide employers with an astronomical amount of private @ @ @ @ @ @ @ workers \u2019 legal recourse against unfair treatment .\nNone of these use cases , even the less-disturbing ones discussed above , warrant the amount of information that bossware usually collects .\nAnd nothing justifies hiding the fact that the surveillance is happening at all .\nMost products take periodic screenshots , and few of them allow workers to choose which ones to share .\nThis means that sensitive medical , banking , or other personal information are captured alongside screenshots of work emails and social media .\nProducts that include keyloggers are even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ capturing passwords to workers \u2019 personal accounts .\nWork Examiner \u2019 s description of its Keylogging feature , specifically highlighting its ability to capture private passwords .\nUnfortunately , excessive information collection often isn \u2019 t an accident , it \u2019 s a feature .\nWork Examiner specifically advertises its product \u2019 s ability to capture private passwords .\nAnother company , Teramind , reports on every piece of information typed into an email client\u2014even if that information is subsequently deleted .\nSeveral products also parse out strings of text from private messages @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know the most intimate details of workers \u2019 personal conversations .\nLet \u2019 s be clear : this software is specifically designed to help employers read workers \u2019 private messages without their knowledge or consent .\nBy any measure , this is unnecessary and unethical .\nWhat can you do ?\nUnder current U.S. law , employers have too much leeway to install surveillance software on devices they own .\nIn addition , little prevents them from coercing workers to install software on their own devices ( as long as the surveillance can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nDifferent states have different rules about what employers can and can \u2019 t do .\nBut workers often have limited legal recourse against intrusive monitoring software .\nThat can and must change .\nAs state and national legislatures continue to adopt consumer data privacy laws , they must also establish protections for workers with respect to their employers .\nTo start : \u2022 Surveillance of workers\u2014even on employer-owned devices\u2014should be necessary and proportionate .\n\u2022 Tools should minimize the information they collect , and avoid vacuuming up personal data like private messages @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the right to know what exactly their managers are collecting .\n\u2022 And workers need a private right of action , so they can sue employers that violate these statutory privacy protections .\nIn the meantime , workers who know they are subject to surveillance\u2014 and feel comfortable doing so\u2014should engage in conversations with their employers .\nCompanies that have adopted bossware must consider what their goals are , and should try to accomplish them in less-intrusive ways .\nBossware often incentivizes the wrong kinds of productivity\u2014for example , forcing people to jiggle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ instead of reading or pausing to think .\nConstant monitoring can stifle creativity , diminish trust , and contribute to burnout .\nIf employers are concerned about data security , they should consider tools that are specifically tailored to real threats , and which minimize the personal data caught up in the process .\nMany workers won \u2019 t feel comfortable speaking up , or may suspect that their employers are monitoring them in secret .\nIf they are unaware of the scope of monitoring , they should consider that work devices may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to passwords .\nIf possible , they should avoid using work devices for anything personal .\nAnd if workers are asked to install monitoring software on their personal devices , they may be able to ask their employers for a separate , work-specific device from which private information can be more easily siloed away .\nFinally , workers may not feel comfortable speaking up about being surveilled out of concern for staying employed in a time with record unemployment .\nA choice between invasive and excessive monitoring and joblessness is not really a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new stresses on us all , and it is likely to fundamentally change the ways we work as well .\nHowever , we must not let it usher in a new era of even-more-pervasive monitoring .\nWe live more of our lives through our devices than ever before .\nThat makes it more important than ever that we have a right to keep our digital lives private\u2014from governments , tech companies , and our employers .\nBennett is an engineer on the Tech Projects team , where he works on Privacy Badger and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was at Access

Patrick Leahy ( D-VT ) , also voted into the bill , purports to protect encryption from being the states \u2019 focus .\nIt \u2019 s certainly an improvement , but we \u2019 re still concerned that the amended bill could be used to attack encryption .\nSen. Leahy \u2019 s amendment prohibits holding companies liable because they use \u201c end-to-end encryption , device encryption , or other encryption services.\n\u201d But the bill still encourages state lawmakers to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , such as demanding that messages be scanned on a local device , before they get encrypted and sent along to their recipient .\nWe think that would violate the spirit

squelches dissent .\nWhether cruising above @ @ @ @ @ @ @ United States is not legally at war , or buzzing over Detroit , Dubuque , and yes , Des Moines , drone fleets make a mockery of sovereignty

Assembly would create a process to sue police officers in state court for using excessive force or taking other actions that violate individual rights without the possibility \u201c qualified immunity \u201d as a defense .\nSen. Kevin Parker ( D-Brooklyn ) introduced Senate Bill 8618 ( S8618 ) on June 22 .\nThe legislation would create a cause of action in state courts to sue police officers \u201c who under color of law , subjects or causes to be subjected , including failing to intervene , any other person @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that create binding obligations on government actors secured by the bill of rights , article one of the state constitution.\n\u201d The law specifically states that \u201c governmental immunity shall not be a defense to liability pursuant to this section ; and qualified immunity shall not be a defense to liability pursuant to this section.\n\u201d Under the proposed law , the court would award \u201c reasonable attorney fees \u201d to the plaintiff if they prevail .\nIt would also allow a defendant to collect costs and attorney fees if the court finds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Typically , people sue police for using excessive force or other types of misconduct through the federal court system under the U.S. Bill of Rights .\nBut federal courts created a qualified immunity defense out of thin air , making it nearly impossible to hold law enforcement officers responsible for actions taken in the line of duty .\nIn order to move ahead with a suit , the plaintiff must establish that it was \u201c clearly established \u201d that the officer \u2019 s action was unconstitutional .\nThe \u201c clearly established \u201d test @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trying to prove excessive force or a violation of their rights .\nS8618 would create an alternative path in state court with no qualified immunity hurdle to clear .\nThe New York bill is similar to a law recently passed in Colorado .\nIt remains unclear how the state legal process will play out in practice .\nThe first question is whether people will actually utilize the state courts instead of the federal process .\nUnder the original constitutional system , it would have never been a federal issue to begin with .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the states , not the federal government .\nBut with the advent of the incorporation doctrine , people reflexively run to federal courts .\nBut by removing the qualified immunity hurdle , it should incentivize people to take advantage of the state system .\nThe second question is if police officers will be able to have cases removed to federal jurisdiction in order to take advantage of qualified immunity .\nState and local law enforcement officers working on joint state/federal task forces will almost certainly will .\nThey are effectively treated as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enforcement officers not operating with a federal task force , it seems unlikely they will be able to remove the case to federal court initially , but that door could open on appeal .\nOne attorney I talked to said that it might be possible for officers to have their case removed to federal court to consider U.S. constitutional ramifications .\nBut he said even then , he thinks federal courts would have to respect the state law prohibiting qualified immunity as a defense .\nThe federal court would likely have to apply @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , even though the federal court might well be able to decide whether or not a U.S. constitutional violation had taken place .\nBut it is possible that the federal court could simply decide its jurisdiction supersedes state law and hear the case under the federal process , including the application of qualified immunity .\nOnly time will tell how the process will play out in practice .\nRegardless , the state process will make it more difficult for police to simply side-step civil suits by declaring sovereign immunity up front .\nBecome @ @ @ @ @ @ @ per month at Patreon .\nThe Supreme Court shows no interest in rolling back its qualified immunity doctrine .\nIn fact , the High Court recently rejected several cases that would have allowed it to revisit the issue .\nFor instance , the SCOTUS let stand an Eleventh Circuit decision granting immunity to a police officer who shot a ten-year-old child in the back of the knee , while repeatedly attempting to shoot a pet dog that wasn \u2019 t threatening anyone .\nCongress could prohibit qualified immunity .\nA bill sponsored by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ayanna Pressley ( D-Mass . )\nwould do just that .\nBut it \u2019 s a long-shot to pass .\nCongress does not have a good track recorded on reining in government power .\nThe best path forward is to bypass the federal system as Colorado has already done and New York is considering .\nOther states should follow their lead and create state processes to hold their police officers accountable .\nWith the evolution of qualified immunity , the federal process is an abject failure .\nAs Supreme Court Justice Byron White @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Briggs , qualified immunity protects \u201c all but the plainly incompetent or those who knowingly violate the law.\n\u201d Reuters called it \u201c a highly effective shield in thousands of lawsuits seeking to hold cops accountable for using excessive force.\n\u201d Attorney and activist Dave Roland called on Missouri to adopt a similar process in an op-ed published by the St. Louis Post-Dispatch .\nS8618 was referred to the Senate

independence from Great Britain and rejected the absolute authority of King George III .\nIn doing so , Americans claimed for themselves the right to self-government and established themselves as the ultimate authority and power .\nIn other words , in America , \u201c we the people \u201d \u2014 sovereign citizens\u2014call the shots .\nSo when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to do so at our bidding and on our behalf , because we are the rulers .\nThat \u2019 s not exactly how it turned out , though , is it ?\nIn the 200-plus years since we boldly embarked on this experiment in self-government , we have been steadily losing ground to the government \u2019 s brazen power grabs , foisted upon us in the so-called name of national security .\nThe government has knocked us off our rightful throne .\nIt has usurped our rightful authority .\nIt has staged the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even pretend that they answer to \u201c we the people.\n\u201d Worst of all , \u201c we the people \u201d have become desensitized to this constant undermining of our freedoms .\nHow do we reconcile the Founders \u2019 vision of the government as an entity whose only purpose is to serve the people with the police state \u2019 s insistence that the government is the supreme authority , that its power trumps that of the people themselves , and that it may exercise that power in any way it sees fit ( that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mass arrests , ethnic cleansing , racial profiling , indefinite detentions without due process , and internment camps ) ?\nThey can not be reconciled .\nThey are polar opposites .\nWe are fast approaching a moment of reckoning where we will be forced to choose between the vision of what America was intended to be ( a model for self-governance where power is vested in the people ) and the reality of what it has become ( a police state where power is vested in the government ) .\nThis slide into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , militarized police , neighbors turning in neighbors , privatized prisons , and forced labor camps , to name just a few similarities\u2014is tracking very closely with what happened in Germany in the years leading up to Hitler \u2019 s rise to power .\nWe are walking a dangerous path right now .\nNo matter who wins the presidential election come November , it \u2019 s a sure bet that the losers will be the American people .\nDespite what is taught in school and the propaganda that is peddled by the media @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a populist election for a representative .\nRather , it \u2019 s a gathering of shareholders to select the next CEO , a fact reinforced by the nation \u2019 s archaic electoral college system .\nAnyone who believes that this election will bring about any real change in how the American government does business is either incredibly na\u00efve , woefully out-of-touch , or oblivious to the fact that as an in-depth Princeton University study shows , we now live in an oligarchy that is \u201c of the rich , by the rich and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spends close to $ 10 billion on elections to select what is , for all intents and purposes , a glorified homecoming king or queen to occupy the White House and fill other government seats , while more than 40 million of its people live in poverty , more than 40 million Americans are on unemployment , more than 500,000 Americans are homeless , and analysts forecast it will take a decade to work our way out of the current COVID-induced recession , that \u2019 s a country whose priorities are out of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nBe warned , however : the Establishment\u2014the Deep State and its corporate partners that really run the show , pull the strings and dictate the policies , no matter who occupies the Oval Office\u2014is not going to allow anyone to take office who will unravel their power structures .\nThose who have attempted to do so in the past have been effectively put out of commission .\nVoting sustains the illusion that we have a democratic republic , but it is merely a dictatorship in disguise , or what political scientists Martin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to as an \u201c economic \u00e9lite domination.\n\u201d In such an environment , the economic elite ( lobbyists , corporations , monied special interest groups ) dictate national policy .\nAs the Princeton University oligarchy study indicates , our elected officials , especially those in the nation \u2019 s capital , represent the interests of the rich and powerful rather than the average citizen .\nAs such , the citizenry has little if any impact on the policies of government .\nWe have been saddled with a two-party system and fooled into believing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Republicans and Democrats , when in fact , the two parties are exactly the same .\nAs one commentator noted , both parties support endless war , engage in out-of-control spending , ignore the citizenry \u2019 s basic rights , have no respect for the rule of law , are bought and paid for by Big Business , care most about their own power , and have a long record of expanding government and shrinking liberty We \u2019 re drowning under the weight of too much debt , too many wars , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a centralized government run by a corporate elite , too many militarized police , too many laws , too many lobbyists , and generally too much bad news .\nThe powers-that-be want us to believe that our job as citizens begins and ends on Election Day .\nThey want us to believe that we have no right to complain about the state of the nation unless we \u2019 ve cast our vote one way or the other .\nThey want us to remain divided over politics , hostile to those with whom we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or anything whose solutions to what ails this country differ from our own .\nWhat they don \u2019 t want us talking about is the fact that the government is corrupt , the system is rigged , the politicians don \u2019 t represent us , the electoral college is a joke , most of the candidates are frauds , and , as I point out in my book Battlefield America : The War on the American People , we as a nation are repeating the mistakes of history\u2014namely , allowing a totalitarian state @ @ @ @ @ @ @ camp inmate Hannah Arendt warned against this when she wrote , \u201c Never has our future been more unpredictable , never have we depended so much on political forces that can not be trusted to follow the rules of common sense and self-interest\u2014forces that look like sheer insanity , if judged by the standards of other centuries.\n\u201d As we once again find ourselves faced with the prospect of voting for the lesser of two evils , \u201c we the people

( July 7 , 2020 ) \u2013 On July 1 , a Virginia law went into effect that decriminalizes marijuana possession despite federal prohibition .\nA bipartisan coalition of senators and representatives introduced House Bill 972 ( HB972 ) and Senate Bill 2 ( SB2 ) earlier this year .\nUnder the law , marijuana will remain illegal in the state , but possession of up to an ounce of cannabis will now be a civil infraction subject to a $ 25 fine instead of a criminal offense .\nUnder the old law , possession of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to 30 days in jail and a $ 500 fine .\nPossession of hash and other concentrates is a felony .\nThe legislation also includes provisions to seal the records of past and future marijuana convictions and bars most employers from asking about marijuana convictions in the hiring process .\nThe bill took a winding path to final approval .\nDifferent versions of the bill were initially passed by the House and the Senate leading to a conference committee .\nThe Senate passed the final version 27-12 and the House approved the measure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ approval to the measure on April 11 , but he recommended amendments , including one that would push the date of a legislative study on the legalization of marijuana back one year to November 2021 .\nThe legislature rejected the delay , but approved other technical amendments , sending the bill back to the governor .\nOn May 21 , Northam signed the bill and it went into effect July 1 .\nSen. Adam Ebbin ( D-Alexandria ) carried the bill in the Senate .\nHe said the enactment of the law is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Become an Activist Post Patron for $ 1 per month at Patreon .\nAccording to a point-in-time study included in a State Crime Commission report , there were 127 people being held in Virginia jails solely on marijuana charges on one day in July 2017 .\nSuccessful decriminalization has generated momentum in Virginia and there is now a push to legalize marijuana completely during a special session this summer .\n\u201c The Commonwealth is past the point for studies on policing and law enforcement\u2014immediate action must be taken to eliminate law enforcement abuse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ weed out institutional discrimination , and increase accountability at all levels of law enforcement , \u201d the Virginia Legislative Black Caucus ( VLBC ) said in a list of priorities it released recently .\nWhile the enactment of HB972/SB2 will not end marijuana prohibition in Virginia , it will drastically reduce prosecution and disincentivize enforcement efforts .\nUnder the federal Controlled Substances Act ( CSA ) passed in 1970 , the federal government maintains complete prohibition of marijuana .\nOf course , the federal government lacks any constitutional authority to ban or regulate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , despite the opinion of the politically connected lawyers on the Supreme Court .\nIf you doubt this , ask yourself why it took a constitutional amendment to institute federal alcohol prohibition .\nDespite federal prohibition , Virginia legalized medical marijuana in 2018 and expanded the program last year .\nDecriminalization of marijuana would remove yet another layer of laws punishing the possession and use of marijuana in the state , but federal prohibition would remain in effect .\nThis is significant because FBI statistics show that law enforcement makes approximately 99 of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ federal law .\nWhen states stop enforcing marijuana laws , they sweep away most of the basis for 99 percent of marijuana arrests .\nFurthermore , figures indicate it would take 40 percent of the DEA \u2019 s yearly-budget just to investigate and raid all of the dispensaries in Los Angeles \u2013 a single city in a single state .\nThat doesn \u2019 t include the cost of prosecution .\nThe lesson ?\nThe feds lack the resources to enforce marijuana prohibition without state assistance .\nVirginia joins a growing number of states @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it in practice .\nColorado , Washington state , Oregon and Alaska were the first states to legalize recreational cannabis , and California , Nevada , Maine and Massachusetts joined them after ballot initiatives in favor of legalization passed in November 2016 .\nMichigan followed suit when voters legalized cannabis for general use in 2018 .\nVermont became the first state to legalize marijuana through a legislative act in 2018 .\nIllinois followed suit in 2019 .\nWith 33 states including allowing cannabis for medical use , the feds find themselves in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enforce prohibition anymore .\nThe lesson here is pretty straightforward .\nWhen enough people say , \u2018 No !\n\u2019 to the federal government , and enough states pass laws backing those people up , there \u2019 s not much the feds can do to shove their so-called laws , regulations or mandates down our throats .\nThe push to decriminalize marijuana in Virginia underscores another important strategic reality .\nOnce a state legalizes marijuana \u2013 even if only in a very limited way \u2013 it tends to eventually expand .\nAs the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ develop and demand expands .\nThat creates pressure to further relax state law .\nThese new laws represent a further erosion of unconstitutional federal marijuana

administration was about the only sector of the economy that was booming .\nHe initially found a job in the Agricultural Adjustment Administration , but later transferred to the War Department in 1941 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Thornton first met Assistant Secretary of War Robert A. Lovett ( 1895-1986 ) .\nThornton had displayed an outstanding aptitude in the language of statistics and originally contacted Lovett on the recommendation of a university economics professor who was a common friend of both men .\nThroughout much of Thornton \u2019 s career , Lovett would prove to be his most valuable ally .\nBoth men were from Texas , but from opposite ends of the socio-economic spectrum .\nWhile Thornton was from humble beginnings , Lovett was a creature of the old @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Skull & Bones secret society as well as a partner at Brown Brothers Harriman .\nLovett saw Thornton as someone who could help him in his effort to massively expand American air war capabilities .\nIn early March of 1941 , Lovett arranged for Thornton to be inserted into the plans division of the Army Air Force ( AAF ) , putting Thornton in charge of a small group of men ; mainly from the National Guard .\nThe catalyst for expanding the Army Air Force came with the Japanese attack @ @ @ @ @ @ @ official entry into WWII .\nBy March of 1942 , General Henry \u2018 Hap \u2019 Arnold ( 1886-1950 ) had announced a major reorganization of AAF headquarters .\nAs part of this reorganization , Tex was made the head of a relatively insignificant group called Statistical Control operating under Colonel Byron E. Gates and his office of Management Control .\nIn order to carry out his expansion plans , Secretary of War Lovett subsequently suggested to Tex that he go to the Harvard Business School to persuade the dean into creating a program @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the area of statistical management .\nIn April of 1942 Thornton did so .\nAt the Harvard Business School , Thornton met with Dean Wallace B. Donham ( 1877-1954 ) who promptly called upon a group of the youngest members of his faculty .\nThe dozen or so assistant professors assembled to receive Thornton all had draft numbers .\nSome of them had draft numbers so low that they might be sucked into the war at any moment .\nThe future Secretary of Defense Robert McNamara ( 1916-2009 ) was among this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how he had been sent to recruit men who could help reorganize the AAF .\nThornton convinced them to come with him to Washington to design his proposed Harvard Business School Stat Control courses .\nMere hours after meeting with Tex , the group of young professors boarded a train bound for Washington .\nSix weeks later , more than one hundred students reported to Stat Scho ol \u2019 s first session .\nThe students Tex recruited were first required to spend six weeks at the Army Air Forces \u2019 Officer Candidate School @ @ @ @ @ @ @ military training with an emphasis on their job at hand .\nHalf way through this training , Tex arrived to choose the best and brightest who could then complete their military training at Harvard .\nThe Stat School took up quarters at Harvard \u2019 s Mellon Hall as the newly mobilized Harvard Business School took on the appearance of a military academy .\nWithin a year , Harvard had suspended all civilian instruction .\nThe graduates of Harvard \u2019 s Stat School were dispatched to U.S. military bases around the country and around @ @ @ @ @ @ @ keep track of AAF inventories .\nThe most important of Stat Control \u2019 s operations were those at Patterson Field in Dayton , Ohio which employed the world \u2019 s largest installation of International Business Machines ( IBM ) computer equipment .\nEvery night , Stat Control reports from around the country would come in via teletype and be compiled .\nEvery morning a report would be produced showing local inventories of AAF resources including airplanes , personnel , parts , fuel , ordnance , and more .\nProduction of these reports , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ purpose of Stat Control and it was a smashing success .\nThe success of this program earned the Stat Control members the moniker of \u2018 The Whiz Kids.\n\u2019 Following the war , Thornton created brochures which he sent to more than one hundred companies advertising himself and selected members of Stat Control for employment .\nHe received at least 10 replies expressing interest from , among others , Arthur D.

George ( 1893-1986 ) to be the general manager of Hughes Aircraft with Thornton as his assistant manager .\nThornton then went about building a new team at Hughes Aircraft .\nThornton selected men from his Harvard Stat Control days to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also called upon others to join them .\nIn 1948 the new Hughes Aircraft got their first contract \u2013 a $ 8M dollar deal to build fire control systems for the Lockheed F-94 jet fighter aircraft .\nAt the new Hughes Aircraft , Tex Thornton was learning a lot about electronics .\nHe saw the immense potential of the field , not only for the military but for civilian life as well .\nHe was becoming somewhat of a futurist .\nDuring a visit to Wright-Patterson Air Force Base in September of 1948 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ war , General Kenneth B. Wolfe ( 1896-1971 ) , now the head of procurement for the Air Force , told Thornton about something called Project Bow Legs .\nAs of the time of Thornton \u2019 s visit , Hughes had just scored the contract for Project Bow Legs .\nProject Bow Legs was all about what Thornton \u2019 s scientists at the new Hughes Aircraft were already working on : jet aircraft fire control .\nThornton , ever the opportunistic salesman , immediately began selling Wolfe on the idea of greatly expanding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doubts , but Thornton soon ran his ideas past Ramo and Wooldridge at Hughes Aircraft and came up with a planned schedule .\nHe told Wolfe he could have a system produced in 11 months .\nIt was game time for Thornton and Hughes Aircraft .\nThornton began recruiting top-level managers from every blue-chip defense contractor in the country including General Electric .\nRamo and Wooldridge , once again , lured many more sharp scientists and technicians to Hughes Aircraft for the project .\nThornton and Hughes met the deadline and , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ again transformed itself .\nHughes Aircraft was now the sole provider of jet aircraft fire control systems for the entire U.S. Air Force .\nThornton and Hughes then captured a key contract to build the Air Force \u2019 s first radar guided air-to-air missile known as the Falcon .\nDuring this time , between the detonation of the first Soviet nuclear bomb in 1949 and the outbreak of the Korean War in 1950 , Hughes Aircraft had all the business they could ever want .\nHughes emerged with a virtual monopoly on all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ electronics needs .\nThornton \u2019 s Hughes Aircraft was another smashing success .\nDietrich resented Thornton \u2019 s success .\nHe had never liked what Thornton was doing and to see him be so successful at it made him all the more resentful .\nCompounding the problem , even though Thornton had done tremendous work for Howard Hughes , it appears that , once again , a clash of the egos , this time between Hughes and Thornton , had soured their business relationship .\nThese familiar frictions continued for some time until @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Wooldridge , and 19 other members of the scientific and engineering staff submitted to Howard Hughes a joint letter of resignation .\nRamo and Wooldridge went on to form the Ramo-Wooldridge Corporation which eventually became TRW , Inc.

proposed ending police traffic enforcement .\nThe effects of such a radical shift in policing could be massive .\nThe move comes after claims that police officers all too often escalate minor traffic stops into deadly situations .\nThese claims are well founded .\n\u201c Most traffic stops don \u2019 t really warrant a police officer , \u201d said Darrell Owens , the co-executive of East Bay for Everyone , a housing and traffic non-profit .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ plan to Berkeley City Council .\nAccording to ABC 7 , he says ideally the city would take money away from Berkeley PD to fund a new department .\n\u201c A minor traffic violation should not have resulted in the murder of a black or brown body , but at the same time we can also re-examine the nature of punitive law enforcement and broken windows policing that makes traffic enforcement so deadly to begin with.\n\u201d The officials who proposed ending police traffic enforcement dispelled any preconceived notions that this would allow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ roads .\n\u201c We don \u2019 t want to inhibit apprehending dangerous criminals or drunk drivers .\nThat is not the intent , \u201d said Berkeley City councilmember , Lori Droste .\nThough it is a step in the right direction , because government relies on revenue generated from traffic stops to fund itself , this proposal stops short of actually ending the practice of extorting citizens .\nInstead , according to the report , Berkeley \u2019 s City Council will vote on a proposal to create a Department of Transportation and use @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stops instead of Berkeley Police officers .\n\u201c I get stopped when I \u2019 m in my car many times and there \u2019 s no straight answer for it\u2026 and you know what it \u2019 s about , it \u2019 s about skin color , \u201d said Berkeley resident , Tim Davis , who added , \u201c I don \u2019 t think police should do everything in the City.\n\u201d Unfortunately , Davis is right .\nBecome an Activist Post

minorities .\nOften times , officers treat these stops as gateways to fish for drug activity or other victimless crimes .\nWhile ending the drug war would have a much more profound effect , this is a good start .\nAs the 2014 death of Mike Brown in Ferguson exposed , in 2013 , African-Americans accounted for 86 percent of traffic stops , while making up only 63 percent of Ferguson \u2019 @ @ @ @ @

rolling forward .\nLevar Jones was stopped for a seat belt offense , just as he was getting out of his car to enter a convenience store .\nDirected to show his license , Jones leaned into his car to get his wallet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the \u201c fearful \u201d officer .\nJones was also unarmed , and it was later revealed that he was actually wearing his seat belt .\nBobby Canipe was pulled over for

stops aren \u2019 t always in cars either .\nDontrell Stevens was stopped \u201c for not bicycling properly.\n\u201d The officer pursuing him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bike was suspicious .\nHe thought the way

week , the Kansas City City Council voted to decriminalize marijuana possession and eliminate all penalties in the city despite federal prohibition .\nMayor Quinton Lucas ( D ) , along with four members of the city council , filed the measure last month .\nThe ordinance repeals a provision in the Kansas City Code of Ordinances setting criminal penalties for marijuana possession .\nUnder the

in 1970 , the federal government maintains complete prohibition of marijuana .\nOf course , the federal government lacks any constitutional authority to ban or regulate cannabis within the borders of

prohibition .\nDespite federal prohibition , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in 2018 .\nDecriminalization of marijuana in Kansas City removes yet another layer of laws punishing the possession and use of marijuana in the state , but federal prohibition remains in effect .\nThis is significant because FBI statistics show that law enforcement makes approximately 99 of 100 marijuana arrests under state , not federal law .\nWhen states stop enforcing marijuana laws , they sweep away most of the basis for 99 percent of marijuana arrests .\nFurthermore , figures indicate it would take 40 percent of the DEA \u2019 s yearly-budget @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the dispensaries in Los Angeles \u2013 a single city in a single state .\nThat doesn \u2019 t include the cost of prosecution .\nThe lesson ?\nThe feds lack the resources to enforce marijuana prohibition without state assistance .\nKansas City joins a growing number of states and localities increasingly ignoring federal prohibition , and nullifying it in practice .\nColorado , Washington state , Oregon and Alaska were the first states to legalize recreational cannabis , and California , Nevada , Maine and Massachusetts joined them after ballot initiatives in favor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Michigan followed suit when voters legalized cannabis for general use in 2018 .\nVermont became the first state to legalize marijuana through a legislative act in 2018 .\nIllinois

is not evidence-based as the NY Times reports , researchers found no coronavirus infections among thousands of people allowed to return @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the governor \u2019 s unconstitutional order was not some criminal act but a financial necessity as this is his only means of income .\n\u201c It \u2019 s a do or die situation , \u201d he said .\nWhile taking all the necessary precautions , multiple people , who were tired of not being able to work out , voluntarily used the facility .\nThis was a no-no to the police state , however , who promptly raided the gym .\nEvery single staff member and patron were detained and cited for their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who happened to be identified as a Detroit Police officer .\nAccording to the Michigan Sentry , several individuals have reportedly confirmed that the individual seen leaving the gym is a plainclothes officer with the Detroit Police Department named Lamar Harris , but have done so off the record due to fears of possible retribution .\nAs the Sentry reports , according to a report from the Detroit News , Harris graduated and became an officer in 2019 .\nThey also presented photos of celebrated cookies made by Harris \u2019 friends and family @ @ @ @ @ @ @ featuring his presumed badge number , 881 .\nHarris \u2019 Instagram account shows the massive cop flexing his biceps which some could say makes him a good candidate for a urinalysis to test for steroids .\nBut I digress .\nAs the video below shows , as all the other gym goers were detained and cited , the man identified as Harris was simply allowed to walk right through the door .\nAnd just like that , the blue line protected their own while punishing everyone else for the non-crime of staying healthy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Generate Extra Income \u201c Go stand in line back there and go get a ticket , \u201d the unidentified cop says as he lets Harris walk right out of the front door without so much as a slap on the wrist .\nThe irony of police officers detaining and fining people for trying to stay healthy during a pandemic is thick .\nBut it is even more prevalent given the fact that one of their own was doing the exact same thing and he was let go .\nUlicne said that he and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 30 in 25th District Court in Lincoln Park to answer to the citations \u2014 except for the cop of course .\n\u201c We all got violation of the governor \u2019 s orders , \u201d he said .\n\u201c The officers said they \u2019 re not sure on how we \u2019 re going to be punished .\nThey don \u2019 t know what the fines are going to come out to , but I do believe it \u2019 s a misdemeanor.\n\u201d In total , according to WYXZ , police issued 21 violations to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\n\u201c I happened to finish my workout and they got me on the way out , \u201d Taylor said .\nTaylor told WXYZ that he plans to fight the ticket in court and there is already an attorney willing to represent those who received citations \u2014 pro bono .\nAttorney Nick Somberg , told WXYZ none of the members should have received tickets for simply being inside the gym .\nHe says they plan to fight the violations in the court .\n\u201c The Governor \u2019 s

evolves just as you evolve \u201d is set to be introduced in \u201c low-income , remote communities \u201d in West Africa thanks to a public-private partnership between the Bill Gates-backed GAVI vaccine alliance , Mastercard and the AI-powered \u201c identity authentication \u201d company , Trust Stamp .\nThe program , which was first launched in late 2018 , will see Trust Stamp \u2019 s digital identity platform integrated into the GAVI-Mastercard \u201c Wellness Pass , \u201d a digital vaccination record and identity system that is also linked to Mastercard \u2019 s click-to-play system @ @ @ @ @ @ @ learning technology called NuData .\nMastercard , in addition to professing its commitment to promoting \u201c centralized record keeping of childhood immunization \u201d also describes itself as a leader toward a \u201c World Beyond Cash , \u201d and its partnership with GAVI marks a novel approach towards linking a biometric digital identity system , vaccination records , and a payment system into a single cohesive platform .\nThe effort , since its launch nearly two years ago , has been funded via $ 3.8 million in GAVI donor funds in addition to a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation .\nIn early June , GAVI reported that Mastercard \u2019 s Wellness Pass program would be adapted in response to the coronavirus ( COVID-19 ) pandemic .\nAround a month later , Mastercard announced that Trust Stamp \u2019 s biometric identity platform would be integrated into Wellness Pass as Trust Stamp \u2019 s system is capable of providing biometric identity in areas of the world lacking internet access or cellular connectivity and also does not require knowledge of an individual \u2019 s legal name or identity to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Mastercard , and Trust Stamp will soon be launched in West Africa and will be coupled with a COVID-19 vaccination program once a vaccine becomes available .\nThe push to implement biometrics as part of national ID registration systems has been ongoing for many years on the continent and has become a highly politicized issue in several African countries .\nOpposition to similar projects in Africa often revolves around the costs surrounding them , such as the biometric voter management system that the Electoral Commission of Ghana has been trying to implement @ @ @ @ @ @ @ December .\nBright Simons , honorary VP of the IMANI policy think tank , has questioned the \u201c budgetary allocation \u201d for the new system , claiming that the \u201c unnecessary registration of 17 million people all over again \u201d represents millions of dollars \u201c being blown for reasons that nobody can explain in this country.\n\u201d Trust Stamp \u2019 s biometric identity system , largely funded by Mastercard \u2019 s massive investment in the company in February , utilizes a technology it calls Evergreen Hash that creates an AI-generated \u201c 3D mask @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a person \u2019 s face , palm or fingerprint .\nOnce this \u201c mask \u201d is created , much of the original data is discarded and encryption keys are created in place of a person \u2019 s name or other more traditional identifiers .\n\u201c Only a small percentage of the data that originally existed is in the hash , \u201d Trust Stamp CEO Gareth Genner has stated .\n\u201c What you have is something safer for storing because it can \u2019 t be used to directly identify you .\nNo one would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ numbers.\n\u201d The result , according to Genner , is an \u201c irreversible non-personally identifiable information \u201d system that \u201c protects privacy , reduces potential for misuse and allows effective inclusion when there is no other form of legal record.\n\u201d Genner also explained in a recent press release that the unique \u201c hash \u201d is capable of \u201c evolving \u201d as a new hash with updated health information is created every time a child or individual gets a vaccine .\nTrust Stamp \u2019 s AI algorithms can accurately determine if different hashes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that \u201c the hash evolves over time just as you evolve , \u201d said Genner .\nIt is unclear how much the Wellness Pass initiative is motivated by public health concerns as opposed to free market considerations .\nIndeed , the GAVI alliance , largely funded by the Bill and Melinda Gates and Rockefeller Foundations , as well as allied governments and the vaccine industry , is principally concerned with improving \u201c the health of markets for vaccines and other immunization products , \u201d rather than the health of individuals , according to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u2019 s GAVI partnership is directly linked to its \u201c World Beyond Cash \u201d effort , which mainly bolsters its business model that has long depended on a reduction in the use of physical cash .\nTrust Stamp also shares this market-focused vision for its digital identity system as the company has stated that it is looking for new commercialization options for its Evergreen Hash technology , specifically with prison systems .\nTalks with private and public prison systems have revealed an interest in their utilization of Trust Stamp \u2019 s technology to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ without making them pay for pricey ankle bracelets that monitor their every move , \u201d as Trust Stamp \u2019 s platform would ostensibly provide that same function but in a \u201c touchless \u201d and less expensive manner .\nTrust Stamp \u2019 s interest in providing its technology to both COVID-19 response and to law enforcement is part of a growing trend where numerous companies providing digital solutions to COVID-19 also offer the same solutions to prison systems and law enforcement for the purposes of surveillance and \u201c predictive policing

"In a bid to suppress protests against police brutality and racial injustice in Portland , Oregon , federal authorities have turned the city into a de facto police state in recent days , where heavily-armed security personnel roam the streets and unmarked vehicles snatch suspected protesters from city streets .\nMultiple reports from Portland indicate that the camouflaged federal officers from the U.S .\nMarshals Special Operation Group and the SWAT-like Border Patrol Tactical Unit ( BORTAC ) have been escalating their tactics against residents in a manner that increasingly resembles some of the world \u2019 s most authoritarian governments @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the federal deployment isn \u2019 t even wanted by local authorities .\nOn Thursday night , Oregon Public Broadcasting reported that federal law enforcement have been driving around downtown Portland in unmarked minivans and grabbing protesters , without even offering an explanation of why they are being detained , and whisking them off .\nIn one such incident on July 15 , protesters Conner O \u2019 Shea and Mark Pettibone were leaving a protest at the Multnomah County Justice Center and Mark O. Hatfield Federal Courthouse when an unmarked minivan pulled up in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ guys in camo , \u201d O \u2019 Shea explained .\n\u201c Four or five of them pop out , open the door and it was just like , \u2018 Oh **** .\nI don \u2019 t know who you are or what you want with us.\n\u2019 \u201d While O \u2019 Shea said he managed to flee \u2013 after which he was pursued by a second minivan \u2013 Pettibone wasn \u2019 t so lucky .\n\u201c I am basically tossed into the van , \u201d Pettibone said .\n\u201c And I had my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ couldn \u2019 t see and they held my hands over my head.\n\u201d Pettibone was understandably terrified and had no idea why he was arrested or detained before ultimately being released two hours later .\nHowever , during the ordeal he was essentially blindfolded while surrounded by armor-clad men who wore no markings and didn \u2019 t even identify themselves .\n\u201c It was basically a process of facing many walls and corners as they patted me down and took my picture and rummaged through my belongings , \u201d he said .\n\u201c @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is a whole lot of nothing.\n\u2019 \u201d While the two attend protests regularly , as is their right , they haven \u2019 t engaged in any property destruction , vandalism , or even shined laser pointers at officers .\nHowever , Pettibone assumed that it was because he was profiled based on his wardrobe .\n\u201c I just happened to be wearing black on a sidewalk in downtown Portland at the time , \u201d Pettibone said .\n\u201c And that apparently is grounds for detaining me.\n\u201d The abductions of protesters off @ @ @ @ @ @ @ indiscriminate violence being meted out against local residents .\nOn Thursday night and Friday morning , federal officers in gas masks marched through downtown Portland and inundated the streets with tear gas .\nA federal judge had previously barred Portland police from using the chemical agent , reports New York Times .\nThe violent federal deployment to Portland appears to be a result of President Donald Trump \u2019 s June 26 executive order to protect monuments across the country .\nHowever , the order also included provisions granting federal authorities like the Department @ @ @ @ @ @ @ provide \u201c personnel to assist with the protection of Federal monuments , memorials , statues , or property.\n\u201d And on Thursday , acting Homeland Security secretary Chad Wolf arrived in Portland and essentially declared his intention to stamp out what he described as a \u201c violent mob \u201d of anarchists enabled by a weak local response .\nLocal elected officials have denounced the aggressive federal intervention in Portland .\nMayor Ted Wheeler , who has pleaded for calm since protests broke out following the May 25 killing of George Floyd by Minneapolis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ totally \u201c irresponsible.\n\u201d \u201c We do not need or want their help , \u201d Wheeler earlier this week .\n\u201c The best thing they can do is stay inside their building , or leave Portland altogether.\n\u201d Meanwhile , Multnomah County Sheriff Mike Reese decried what he called a \u201c significant setback \u201d dealt by federal authorities to attempts to calm tensions between the community and the police .\nMost forcefully , Oregon Gov .\nKate Brown has accused Trump of essentially starting a war on the streets of Portland in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ states for the November presidential election \u2013 an approach she was sure of following her talk with the acting DHS head .\n\u201c This political theater from President Trump has nothing to do with public safety , \u201d Gov .\nBrown said in a Thursday tweet thread .\n\u201c The president is failing to lead this nation .\nNow he is deploying federal officers to patrol the streets of Portland in a blatant abuse of power by the federal government.\n\u201d I told Acting Secretary Wolf that the federal government should remove all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she added .\n\u201c His response showed me he is on a mission to provoke confrontation for political purposes .\nHe is putting both Oregonians and local law enforcement officers in harm \u2019 s way.\n\u201d \u201c Trump is

Bank @ @ @ @ @ @ @ members of the Council on Foreign Relations and later by the Trilateral Commission .\nCorruption and self-interest run amok as public funds are converted into private hands by the

that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ global welfare organization .\nWhy is it then , that The World Bank joins the International Monetary Fund and the World Trade Organization as organizations that people around the world just love to hate ?\nIn reality , the World Bank carries its weight , along with the International Monetary Fund and the Bank for International Settlements , to forcibly integrate minor countries of the world into its own brand of capitalistic democracy .\nA sibling of the IMF , the World Bank was born out of the U.N. Monetary and Financial Conference @ @ @ @ @ @ @ July , 1944 .\nThe original name given to the World Bank was the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development ( IBRD ) and reflects its original mission : to rebuild Europe after the devastation of World War II .\nThe name \u201c World Bank \u201d was not actually adopted until 1975 .\nBoth the IBRD and the IMF were created as independent specialized agencies of the United Nations , of which they remain to this day .\nThe word \u201c Development \u201d in the IBRD name was rather insignificant at the time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ still under colonial rule , with each colonial master responsible for the business activities in their respective countries .\nNote : It is argued by some that there was an original desire by banking elites to put an end to colonialism by restructuring investment and trade patterns in colonized countries .\nThis paper will not deal with this issue , but it should be noted that this has been exactly what has happened , in many cases being aided by the operations of the World Bank and the IMF .\nAs a \u201c @ @ @ @ @ @ @ World Bank was impotent .\nIt ultimately loaned only $ 497 ( US ) million for reconstruction projects .\nThe Marshall Plan , by contrast , became the true engine of the reconstruction of Europe by loaning over $ 41 ( US ) billion by 1953 .\nSee : 177 Different Ways to Generate Extra Income The primary architects of the World Bank were Harry Dexter White and John Maynard Keynes , both of whom are summarized Global Banking : The International Monetary Fund ( see article for complete details ) as follows @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and intellectual credentials of the creators of the IMF [ and the World Bank ] : One was an English ideologue economist with a markedly global bent , and the other a corrupt and high-ranking U.S. government official who was a top Soviet spy.\n\u201d 2 Today , the World Bank consists of two primary units : The already-mentioned IBRD and the International Development Association ( IDA ) , which was created in 1960 .\nThe IBRD lends only to governments who are credit-worthy ; in other words , there is an expectation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The IDA , by contrast , only lends to governments who are not credit-worthy and are usually the poorest nations .\nTogether , they create a \u201c one-two \u201d punch in global lending to any government that they are able to talk into borrowing .\nThe U.S. currently contributes about $ 1 billion per year of taxpayer funds to the IDA .\nThree other affiliates combine with the World Bank , to be collectively called the World Bank Group : \u2022 The International Finance Corporation ( IFC ) \u2013 Founded in 1956 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ developing counties .\n\u2022 The Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency ( MIGA ) -Founded in 1988 , provides guarantees to investors in developing countries against losses caused by noncommercial risks .\n\u2022 The International Center for Settlement of Investment Disputes ( ICSID ) \u2013 Founded in 1966 , provides international facilities for conciliation and arbitration of investment disputes .\nHeadquarters for the World Bank is Washington , DC .\nIt employs approximately 7,000 in the Washington complex , and another 3,000 in 109 offices scattered throughout member countries .\nIBRD funds its lending operations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ instruments to other banks , pension funds , insurance companies and corporations around the world .\nBy contrast , the IDA is funded by ( taxpayer ) contributions from member countries .\nAnnual levels of lending is roughly equal between IBRD and IDA .\nWhile the IFC generates its own capital in open markets , MIGA and ICSID receive the majority of their funding from the World Bank , much of which is taxpayer funded .\nOwnership of the World Bank consists of voting shares held by member countries , according to size @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is the largest shareholder with 16.4 percent of total votes .\nThe next largest voting blocks are Japan ( 7.9 percent ) and Germany ( 4.5 percent ) .\nBecause major decisions require an 85 percent super-majority vote , the U.S. can effectively veto any change ( 100 % -16.4 % = 83.6 % ) .\nIt should be noted that the United Nations is headquartered in the United States , on land originally donated to it by David Rockefeller .\nThe Bretton Woods Conference was held in New Hampshire .\nEvery president @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the United States .\nIt is no wonder that the rest of the world views the World Bank as an American operation .\nThere has been an unwritten but traditional rule that the World Bank president will always be an American , while the president of the IMF is European .\n( A recent exception to this is the current IMF president , who is Canadian ) .\nIt is instructive to review the past presidents of the World Bank , because it demonstrates which elite cabal is really in control of World @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will point strongly to the real beneficiaries of the World Bank hegemony .\nThe complete biographies and accomplishments of these men far exceed the available space in this report , so only a few highlights are noted .\n1 .\nEugene Meyer .\nJune to December , 1946 .\nChairman , Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve from 1930-1933 ;

Rockefeller and Brzezinski , and was widely considered to be a central figure in the global elite of his day .\nIt was McNamara who caused the focus of the World Bank to fall on poverty and poverty reduction .\nThis has essentially remained the siren call right into the present .\nThis was a brilliant maneuver because who would ever say they are anti-poor or pro-poverty ?\nAny attack on the Bank would thus be viewed as an attack on poverty relief itself .\nFrom 1968 onward , the battle cry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ poverty.\n\u201d This is clearly seen on the About Us page of the World Bank web site , where these words are prominently displayed : \u201c Each institution ( IBRD and IDA ) plays a different but supportive role in our mission of global poverty reduction and the improvement of living standards.\n\u201c [ emphasis added ] However , Article I of The Articles of Agreement of the IBRD , as amended on February 16 , 1989 , state its official Purposes as follows : ( i ) To assist in the reconstruction @ @ @ @ @ @ @ facilitating the investment of capital for productive purposes , including the restoration of economies destroyed or disrupted by war , the reconversion of productive facilities to peacetime needs and the encouragement of the development of productive facilities and resources in less developed countries .\n( ii ) To promote private foreign investment by means of guarantees or participations in loans and other investments made by private investors ; and when private capital is not available on reasonable terms , to supplement private investment by providing , on suitable conditions , finance for productive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ funds raised by it and its other resources .\n( iii ) To promote the long-range balanced growth of international trade and the maintenance of equilibrium in balances of payments by encouraging international investment for the development of the productive resources of members , thereby assisting in raising productivity , the standard of living and conditions of labor in their territories .\n( iv ) To arrange the loans made or guaranteed by it in relation to international loans through other channels so that the more useful and urgent projects , large and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first .\n( v ) To conduct its operations with due regard to the effect of international investment on business conditions in the territories of members and , in the immediate postwar years , to assist in bringing about a smooth transition from a wartime to a peacetime economy .\nThe Bank shall be guided in all its decisions by the purposes set forth above.3 Note that the word \u201c poverty \u201d does not appear even once .\nThe reason is clear : Whatever \u201c business as usual \u201d might be with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with poverty or poverty reduction .\nRather , the Bank is in business to loan money by stimulating borrowing demand in developing countries , with a view to increasing international trade .\nThe primary beneficiaries of international trade are the global corporations , and the poor are actually poorer as a result .\nThis hypocrisy was noted even by Nobel laureate and former World Bank chief economist , Joseph Stiglitz , as late as 2002 : As far as these \u2018 client countries \u2019 were concerned , it was a charade in which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ redress the problems [ of poverty ] while financial interests worked to preserve as much of the status quo as they could.4 Liberalization and Structural Adjustments When Alden Clausen ( also an original member of the Trilateral Commission ) took over the reins from Robert McNamara in 1981 , a massive shakeup in the bank occurred .\nAs Stiglitz noted , \u201c In the early 1980 \u2019 s a purge occurred inside the World Bank , in its research department , which guided the Bank \u2019 s thinking and direction.\n\u201d 5 Clausen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ global elite , brought in a new chief economist with radical new ideas : \u201c \u2026Ann Krueger , an international trade specialist , best known for her work on \u2018 rent seeking \u2019 \u2014 how special interests use tariffs and other protectionist measures to increase their incomes at the expense of others\u2026Krueger saw government as the problem .\nFree markets were the solution to the problems of developing countries.\n\u201c 6 [ emphasis added ] This was precisely the time when so-called liberalization policies and Structural Adjustments were forcefully implemented as a means @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If governments were the problem , then they should turn over areas of critical infrastructure to private multinational corporations which , according to Krueger , could perform better and more efficiently than bureaucratic government bodies .\nNot surprisingly , most of the career staff economists left the Bank in the early 1980s in protest over Clausen and Krueger \u2019 s policies .\nThe mechanism and operation of Structural Adjustments , along with the tight cooperation between the IMF and the World Bank , was adequately covered in The August Review \u2019 s Global @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The following well-documented example will be the \u201c picture worth a thousand words \u201d in the Review \u2019 s effort to profile self-serving Bank and global corporate policies .\nIt also demonstrates the \u201c tag-team \u201d approach used by the Bank and IMF in the prying open of closed markets in uncooperative countries .\nIt \u2019 s a rather tangled story , but careful reading will produce understanding of how the \u201c system \u201d works .\nIn 1998 , the IMF approved a loan of $ 138 million for Bolivia it described as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and stabilize its domestic economy .\nThe loan was contingent upon Bolivia \u2019 s adoption of a series of \u201c structural reforms , \u201d including Privatization of \u201c all remaining public enterprises , \u201d including water services .\nOnce these loans were approved , Bolivia was under intense pressure from the World Bank to ensure that no public subsidies for water existed and that all water projects would be run on a \u201c cost recovery \u201d basis , meaning that citizens must pay the full construction , financing , operation and maintenance costs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is an essential human need and is crucial for agriculture , cost recovery pricing is unusual , even in the developed world .\nIn this context , Cochabamba , the third largest city in Bolivia , put its water works up for sale in late 1999 .\nOnly one entity , a consortium led by Bechtel subsidiary Aguas del Tunari , offered a bid , and it was awarded a 40-year concession to provide water .\nThe exact details of the negotiation were kept secret , and Bechtel claimed that the numbers within @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But , it later came to light that the price included the financing by Cochabamba \u2019 s citizens of a part of a huge dam construction project being undertaken by Bechtel , even though water from the Misicuni Dam Project would be 600 % more expensive than alternative water sources .\nCochabambans were also required to pay Bechtel a contractually guaranteed 15 % profit , meaning that the people of Cochabamba were asked to pay for investments while the private sector got the profits .\nImmediately upon receiving the concession , the company @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 400 % in some instances .\nThese increases came in an area where the minimum wage is less than $ 100 a month .\nAfter the price hike , self-employed men and women were estimated to pay one quarter of their monthly earnings for water .\nImmediately upon receiving the concession , the company raised water rates by as much as 400 % in some instances .\nThese increases came in an area where the minimum wage is less than $ 100 a month .\nAfter the price hike , self-employed men and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of their monthly earnings for water .\nThe city \u2019 s residents were outraged .\nIn January of 2000 , a broad coalition called the Coordination for the Defense of Water and Life , or simply La Coordinadora , led by a local worker , Oscar Olivera , called for peaceful demonstrations .\nCochabamba was shut down for four days by a general strike and transportation stoppage , but the demonstrations stopped once the government promised to intervene to lower water rates .\nHowever , when there were no results in February , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , however , demonstrators were met with tear gas and police opposition , leaving 175 injured and two youths blinded .\nThe threat that privatization of public services under GATS ( General Agreement on Trade in Services ) poses to democracy were demonstrated in March 2000 .\nLa Coordinadora held an unofficial referendum , counted nearly 50,000 votes , and announced that 96 % of the respondents favored the cancellation of the contract with Aguas del Tunari .\nThey were told by the water company that there was nothing to negotiate .\nOn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ city returned to the streets , shutting down the city .\nAgain , they were met with police resistance , and on April 8 , the government declared martial law .\nThe Bolivian military shot a 17-year-old protester in the face , killing him .\nHowever , the protests continued , and , on April 10 , the government relented , signing an accord that agreed to the demand of the protesters to reverse the water concession .\nThe people of Cochabamba took back their water .\nUnfortunately , this inspiring story didn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the people of Cochabamba .\nOn February 25 , 2002 , Bechtel filed a grievance using investor protections granted in a Bolivia-Netherlands Bilateral Investment Agreement at the World Bank , demanding a $ 25 million dollar payment as compensation for lost profits.7 Note : Bechtel Engineering is the largest civil engineering company in the world .\nIt is privately owned by the Bechtel family .\nFor many years , general counsel ( and vice-president ) for Bechtel was none other than original Trilateral Commission member Caspar Weinberger .\nSince then , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reduction \u201d loans to Bolivia .\nCarefully read the Bank \u2019 s current ( 2006 ) assessment on Bolivia found on its web site : \u201c Bolivia is experiencing a time of difficulty and uncertainty .\nIn recent months , various political and social disturbances have escalated with serious consequences , culminating in the resignation of President Gonzalo S\u00e1nchez de Lozada in October 2003 , and the appointment of Vice-President Carlos Mesa as President .\nThe current administration inherits a difficult economic , political and social climate , which is compounded by long-term @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an economy that has been adversely affected by the region \u2019 s recent economic slump , and widespread public disenchantment with corruption.\n\u201d 8 Political and social disturbances ?\nDifficult economic , political and social climate ?\nProfound inequality ?\nWidespread disenchantment with corruption ?\nIt leaves one speechless .\nSo , in the case of Bolivia , we see the following in operation : \u2022 An IMF loan is made to Bolivia , with conditionalities \u2022 The World Bank steps in to enforce the conditionalities and impose structural adjustments \u2022 The World @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bolivia , and simultaneously brings in private bank consortiums to fund the various projects that Bechtel had in mind .\n\u2022 Bechtel makes a sole-source bid , and it is accepted .\n\u2022 The water project ends in total failure and Bechtel gets kicked out after extreme political pressure from consumers .\n\u2022 Bechtel files a \u201c lost profit \u201d claim according to a pre-negotiated \u201c insurance guarantee \u201d with the World Bank Group ( MIGA , see above . )\n\u2022 If Bechtel wins its claim , it will be paid off @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\n\u2022 Undoubtedly , any loans from private-sector banks that later turn sour , will be bailed-out with taxpayer funds as well .\nThis kind of operation is brazen stealing ( albeit perhaps legally ) of funds from everyone in sight : Bolivia , the city of Cochabamba , the people of Cochabamba , U.S. taxpayers .\nThe only beneficiaries are Bechtel , the commercial banks and a few corrupt politicians who got their customary bribes and kickbacks .\nA penetrating question remains to be answered : When did Bechtel first set their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bechtel have a role in suggesting or creating the conditionalities and Structural Adjustments specified by the World Bank in the first place ?\nIf so , there would be grounds for criminal investigation .\nIt is not likely that the World Bank will tell us , because of its very secretive inner workings .\nEven Stiglitz has noted , \u201c The IMF and World Bank still have disclosure standards far weaker than those of governments in democracies like the United States , or Sweden or Canada .\nThey attempt to hide critical reports @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prevent leaks that often forces the eventual disclosure.\n\u201d 9 The World Bank has received accusations of corruption for many years .\nSince the Bank is an independent specialized agency of the United Nations and considering the old adage , \u201c The fruit doesn \u2019 t fall far from the tree \u201d , this might not come as a surprise to most .\nThe United Nations has a major and documented track record on corruption of every conceivable sort .\nIt would be too simplistic to just leave it at that .\nIn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( R-Indiana ) , as Chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee , kicked off the most recent inquiry into corruption related to the activities of the multilateral development banks , of which the World Bank is foremost .\nThe heads of the various development banks were invited to testify ( voluntarily ) before the Committee .\nAccording to Sen. Lugar , James Wolfensohn \u201c declined the invitation , citing the established practice of Bank officials not to testify before the legislatures of their numerous member countries.\n\u201d Witnesses before the Committee testified that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have been lost to corruption in World Bank lending projects .\nIn Sen. Lugar \u2019 s opening remarks , he points out that the entire history of the World Bank is suspect , with between 5 percent and 25 percent of all lending being lost to corruption .\n\u201c But corruption remains a serious problem .\nDr. Jeffrey Winters of Northwestern University , who will testify before us today , estimates that the World Bank \u2018 has participated mostly passively in the corruption of roughly $ 100 billion of its loan funds intended @ @ @ @ @ @ @ between 5 percent and 25 percent of the $ 525 billion that the World Bank has lent since 1946 has been misused .\nThis is equivalent to between $ 26 billion and $ 130 billion .\nEven if corruption is at the low end of estimates , millions of people living in poverty may have lost opportunities to improve their health , education , and economic condition.\n\u201d 10 One must wonder why World Bank officials have been so sloppy and careless with taxpayer dollars .\nEven further , one must wonder if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the underlying purposes of the Bank , that is , to create bogus and unwanted projects in order to \u201c stimulate \u201d trade .\n\u201c Corruption thwarts development efforts in many ways .\nBribes can influence important bank decisions on projects and on contractors .\nMisuse of funds can inflate project costs , deny needed assistance to the poor , and cause projects to fail .\nStolen money may prop up dictatorships and finance human rights abuses .\nMoreover , when developing countries lose development bank funds through corruption , the taxpayers in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ repay the development banks .\nSo , not only are the impoverished cheated out of development benefits , they are left to repay the resulting debts to the banks.\n\u201d 11 It has not been determined which Bank employees might have taken bribes in exchange for influence , but one can be sure that any deal starting with corruption only has one direction to go \u2014 down .\nIn the end , it is helpless individuals who are left holding the bag .\nThe incurred debts and failed projects just add to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is not to say that charges of corruption at the World Bank are modern revelations only .\nIn 1994 , marking the 50th anniversary of its creation at Bretton Woods , South End Press released 50 Years is Enough : The Case Against the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund , edited by Kevin Danaher .\nThe book details official Bank and IMF reports that reveal the same kind of corruption back then .\nIn addition , it revealed different types of corruption , for instance , \u201c Beyond the wasted money @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an even more sinister side to the Bank during the McNamara years : the World Bank \u2019 s predilection for increasing support to military regimes that tortured and murdered their subjects , sometimes immediately after the violent overthrow of more democratic governments .\nIn 1979 , Senator James Abourezk ( D-South Dakota ) denounced the bank on the Senate floor , noting that the Bank was increasing \u2018 loans to four newly repressive governments [ Chile , Uruguay , Argentina and the Philippines ] twice as fast as all others.\n\u2019 He noted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most repressive governments would receive a third of all World Bank loan commitments in 1979 , and that Congress and the Carter administration had cut off bilateral aid to four of the 15 \u2014 Argentina , Chile , Uruguay and Ethiopia \u2014 for flagrant human rights violations .\nHe blasted the Bank \u2019 s \u2018 excessive secretiveness \u2019 and reminded his colleagues that \u2018 we vote the money , yet we do not know where it goes.\n\u2019 \u201d 12 The text speaks for itself and needs no comment .\nReaders of this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of where the money went !\nThis report does not pretend to be an exhaustive analysis of the World Bank .\nThere are many facets , examples and case studies that could be explored .\nIn fact , many critical and analytical books have been written about the World Bank .\nThe object of this report was to show how the World Bank fits into globalization as a central member in the triad of global monetary powers : The IMF , the BIS and the World Bank .\nThe World Bank is likely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of political flack or public protest .\nSuch is the pattern of elitist-dominated institutions .\nSuch is the history of the International Monetary Fund and the Bank for International Settlements .\nIt is sufficient to conclude that\u2026 \u2022 of the two architects of the World Bank , one was a top Soviet communist agent ( Harry Dexter White ) and the other was a British ideologue ( John Maynard Keynes ) totally dedicated to globalism ( See Global Banking : The International Monetary Fundfor more details on White and Keynes ) \u2022 From @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dominated by international banking interests and members of the Council on Foreign Relations and later by the Trilateral Commission \u2022 the cry of \u201c poverty reduction \u201d is a sham

discussion or opposition , by a voice vote en bloc with several other \u201c uncontroversial \u201d bills .\nMost of the provisions of S. 4133 reflect the lobbying agendas of the travel industry and state governments .\nBut the proposals to exempt REAL-ID Act implementation and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ appeared in neither state government nor industry wish lists for REAL-ID Act \u201c modernization \u201d .\nPresumably , these exemption provisions came from behind-the-scenes lobbying of Senate HSGAC leaders by the DHS .\nThe APA requires public notice ( through the Federal Register ) , an opportunity for the public to comment , and an obligation for the agency to consider and respond to those comments before new federal regulations binding on the public are put into effect .\nThe PRA requires similar public notice and comment , and review and approval by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before any Federal agency can require members of the public to respond to any written or verbal \u201c collection of

201 simulated how the world would respond to a coronavirus pandemic which swept around the planet .\nThe simulation imagined 65 million people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , censorship of alternative viewpoints under the guise of fighting \u201c disinformation , \u201d and even floated the idea of arresting people who question the pandemic narrative .\nThe launch of The Great Reset was supported by Klaus Schwab , the founder and executive chairman of the World Economic Forum ; England \u2019 s Prince Charles ; Antonio Guterres , Secretary-General of the UN ; and Kristalina Georgieva of the International Monetary Fund .\nThe kick-off was truly an international event with the participation of Ma Jun , the chairman of the Green @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Finance and Banking and a member of the Monetary Policy Committee of the People \u2019 s Bank of China .\nThe event was also supported by Bernard Looney , CEO of BP ; Ajay Banga , CEO of Mastercard ; and Bradford Smith , president of Microsoft .\nDuring the launch of The Great Reset , Prince Charles stated that humanity can not waste time because \u201c we need to put nature at the heart of how we operate.\n\u201d UN Secretary-General Guterres called for \u201c more equal , inclusive and sustainable economies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , climate change , and other global challenges .\nIn an opinion piece published in The Globe and Mail , Klaus Schwab provided more details on the goals of The Great Reset ( emphasis added ) : See : 177 Different Ways to Generate Extra Income Schwab goes on to describe several crises facing humanity , including rising government debt , unemployment , and increasing social unrest .\nCombined with COVID-19 , these crises will leave the world less sustainable , less equal and more fragile .\n\u201c We must build entirely new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , \u201d Schwab writes .\nHe details the 3 main components of TGR agenda , specifically fairer market outcomes , investments in \u201c equality and sustainability , \u201d and harnessing the innovations of the Fourth Industrial Revolution .\nWhen it comes to producing \u201c fairer market outcomes , \u201d Schwab calls for governments to improve coordination in tax , regulatory , and fiscal policy .\nHe also calls for upgrading trade agreements and moving towards a \u201c stakeholder economy.\n\u201d When he speaks of equality and sustainability , Schwab means that current and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be used to create a new system that is \u201c more resilient , equitable and sustainable.\n\u201d He also calls for more \u201c green \u201d urban infrastructure and incentivizing industries to improve their environmental record .\nFinally , Schwab calls for utilizing the innovations of \u201c the Fourth Industrial Revolution \u201d to support public good .\nThe 4IR is another pet project of Schwab which was first announced in December 2015 .\nTo put it simply , the 4IR is the digital panopticon of the future , where digital surveillance is omnipresent and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , hopefully , improve our lives .\nSometimes known as \u201c The Internet of Things , \u201d this world will be powered by 5G and 6G technology .\n\u201c Ubiquitous , mobile supercomputing .\nIntelligent robots .\nSelf-driving cars .\nNeuro-technological brain enhancements .\nGenetic editing .\nThe evidence of dramatic change is all around us and it \u2019 s happening at exponential speed , \u201d Schwab wrote for the announcement of the 4IR .\nOf course , for Schwab and other globalists , the 4IR also lends itself towards more central planning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a track and trace society where all transactions are logged , every person has a digital ID that can be tracked , and social malcontents are locked out of society via social credit scores .\nIn fact , much of this call for a Great Reset is already playing out .\nFor example , Mastercard and the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation-funded GAVI recently announced a partnership with AI-powered \u201c identity authentication \u201d company , Trust Stamp .\nAs MintPress News reported , \u201c The program , which was first launched in late @ @ @ @ @ @ @ s digital identity platform integrated into the GAVI-Mastercard \u201c Wellness Pass , \u201d a digital vaccination record and identity system that is also linked to Mastercard \u2019 s click-to-play system that powered by its AI and machine learning technology called NuData.\n\u201c This is why astute readers are skeptical when they hear Schwab say , \u201c the pandemic represents a rare but narrow window of opportunity to reflect , reimagine , and reset our world to create a healthier , more equitable and more prosperous future.\n\u201d Who exactly is Schwab speaking to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ future ?\nHow long has this Great Reset been in the works ?\nThe answers to these questions can help us understand the true goals of this agenda .\nAs researcher Brandon Smith reported , Christine Lagarde , former head of the IMF , discussed a global reset as far back as 2014 .\n\u201c The reset is often mentioned in the same breath as ideas like \u201c the New Multilateralism \u201d or \u201c the Multipolar World Order \u201d or \u201c the New World Order.\n\u201d All of these phrases mean essentially the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Smith correctly notes that the Great Reset is not a response to the pandemic , but rather , \u201c the global reset as implemented by central banks and the BIS/IMF is the cause of the collapse .\nThe collapse is a tool , a flamethrower burning a great hole in the forest to make way for the foundations of the globalist Ziggurat to be built.\n\u201d In early July , Schwab and French author Thierry Malleret released a book outlining the vision of The Great Reset .\nThe book , Covid-19 : The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ world might look like .\n\u201c Will there be enough collective will to take advantage of this unprecedented opportunity to reimagine our world , in a bid to make it a better and more resilient one as it emerges on the other side of this crisis ?\n, \u201d Schwab and Malleret pondered at the release of the book .\nThe two men believe COVID-19 triggered \u201c momentous changes and magnified the fault lines that already beset our economies and societies.\n\u201d They also predict that falling oil prices and a freeze in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ massive anti-government demonstrations .\n\u201c One path will take us to a better world : more inclusive , more equitable and more respectful of Mother Nature .\nThe other will take us to a world that resembles the one we just left behind \u2013 but worse and constantly dogged by nasty surprises , \u201d the authors argue .\nIn the book , Schwab expands upon the initial announcement of The Great Reset .\nOnce again he calls for the 4th Industrial Revolution and the digitalization of everything , powered by 5G technology .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ his book , calling for rethinking the \u201c social contract \u201d society has with governments .\nSchwab also calls for a nature based or green economy .\nIn January 2020 , the WEF released their report , Nature Risk Rising : Why the Crisis Engulfing Nature Matters for Business and the Economy , as part of their New Nature Economy series of reports .\nThe report is \u201c the first of a series of New Nature Economy reports , prepared through the Nature Action Agenda , a platform that aims to encourage a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ society , academics , innovators and youth to disrupt business-as-usual approaches.\n\u201d A second report , The Future of Nature and Business , was released in July .\nOnce again , the WEF states that COVID-19 presents an \u201c opportunity , to change the way we eat , live , grow , build and power our lives to achieve a carbon-neutral , \u2018 nature-positive \u2019 economy and halt biodiversity loss by 2030. Business as usual is no longer an option.\n\u201c In a companion report , the WEF provides some detail on what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eat .\n\u201c Another set of policy measures that would stimulate more resource-efficient food systems entail directing stimulus packages towards R & D to support the diversification away from diets based on resource intensive animal proteins , and towards four main categories of alternatives \u2013 aquatic , plant-based , insect-based and laboratory-cultured , \u201d the report states .\nThis push for alternatives to animal proteins has coincided with a rise in laboratory created fake meat , including products funded by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation .\nInterestingly , the companion report also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the meat sector \u201d which \u201c could accelerate these developments.\n\u201d Coincidentally , because of COVID-19 , the Trump administration awarded $ 15.5 billion in relief aid for the meat and dairy industry .\nOnce again , the predictions and declarations of these global institutions appear to play out in reality as perfect as any scripted TV show .\nThe calls for a Great Reset greatly mimic previous programs and initiatives put forward by other globalist organizations , including the United Nations .\nResearcher F. William Engdahl provided much-needed clarity in a recent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Reset .\nEngdahl notes that , \u201c the declaration by the World Economic Forum to make a Great Reset is to all indications a thinly-veiled attempt to advance the Agenda 2030 \u201c sustainable \u201d dystopian model , a global \u201c Green New Deal \u201d in the wake of the covid19 pandemic measures .\nTheir close ties with Gates Foundation projects , with the WHO , and with the UN suggest we may soon face a far more sinister world after the covid19 pandemic fades.\n\u201d In March , the WEF launched the COVID @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for global government in response to COVID-19 .\nThe answer , WEF believes , is to have greater global cooperation , move away from the nation-state , and tackle the world \u2019 s problems as one international community .\nAlong with the launch of the Action Platform , the WEF released an impressive graphic as part of their \u201c Strategic Intelligence \u201d platform , which outlines the wide ranging ways their plans will effect and shape the world of the 21st century and beyond .\nFrom the media \u2019 s role in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ graphic attempts to provide details on this centrally planned future being promoted by the WEF .\nI encourage all readers to spend an evening going down the rabbit hole that is the COVID Action Platform for a better understanding of where we are headed .\nWith the launch of The Great Reset , the WEF also launched a Strategic Intelligence graphic detailing how their plans will unfold .\nThe Great Reset graphic details how everything from drones , blockchain , the future of energy , LGBTI inclusion , and 3D printing will play @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Once again , I encourage readers to take a dive into this graphic to gain clarity on what the WEF and their partners have planned for the coming decade .\nThe WEF promotes itself as the \u201c International Organization for Public-Private Cooperation.\n\u201d They partner with a variety of private companies , philanthropic outlets , and governments to achieve their goals .\nResearcher Steven Guinness recently outlined how the WEF partners with various institutions to accomplish their stated aims and how the Strategic Intelligence platform is \u201c co-curated with leading topic experts from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ organizations.\n\u201d \u201c \u2018 Co-curators \u2018 are perhaps the most important aspect to consider here , given that they have the ability to \u2018 share their expertise with the Forum \u2019 s extensive network of members , partners and constituents , as well as a growing public audience , \u2019 \u201d Guinness writes .\n\u201c It is safe to assume then that when co-curators speak , members and partners of the World Economic Forum listen .\nThis in part is how the WEF \u2019 s agenda takes shape.\n\u201d As Guinness notes , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ map of the globalist vision include Harvard university , the Massachusetts Institute of Technology , Imperial College London , Oxford University , Yale and the European Council on Foreign Relations .\nSeveral of these institutions continue to play an influential role in shaping the narrative around COVID-19 .\nThe WEF \u2019 s highest level of partnership is known as Strategic Partners .\nThere are only 100 international companies listed as Strategic Partners .\nEach partner receives an invitation if they have \u201c alignment with forum values.\n\u201d These partners \u201c shape the future @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Forum projects and championing public-private dialogue.\n\u201d The WEF \u2019 s Strategic Partners include Johnson & Johnson , and the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation .\nBill Gates is also a long time \u201c Agenda Contributor \u201d for the WEF .\nAs mentioned above , the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation partnered with the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security and the WEF on the Event 201 pandemic exercise in October 2019 .\nJohnson & Johnson were also partners in the exercise .\nAs TLAV has previously documented , the Bill and Melinda @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the WEF : their publicly stated goals mask a global control agenda .\nThus , it should come as no surprise that Klaus Schwab , founder of the WEF , is a former attendee and member of the Steering Committee for the secretive Bilderberg Group .\nThe WEF itself is akin to a more public Bilderberg Group which brings together around 3,000 business leaders , international political leaders , economists , celebrities , and journalists for a five day conference to discuss global issues .\nThe WEF meets every January in Davos @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nThe elitism of the WEF has resulted in Schwab and his cohorts being nicknamed The Davos Class .\nIn January 2021 the theme of the WEF meeting will be \u201c The Great Reset.\n\u201d It \u2019 s important that we keep an eye on the WEF and their push for the Great Reset as we draw closer to election 2020 and a potential Dark Winter .\nKlaus Schwab , Bill Gates , and their ilk are determined to present themselves as the saviors of humanity .\nThey are using the COVID-19 panic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ while selling it as the cure to our problems .\nThis predator class attempts to mask their true intentions with flowery language designed to lull the waking masses back to sleep .\nTo be clear , our world is absolutely , without a doubt existing in an unsustainable paradigm .\nWe do have growing income inequality , police violence , failing healthcare systems , and insufficient food production systems .\nThese problems were apparent before COVID-19 and the fragility of these systems has indeed become more obvious in recent months .\nHowever , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them to stay in the driver \u2019 s seat as they careen us into a future of technocratic control and the end of individual liberty .\nWhile Schwab and Gates would prefer that the people of the world submit to their vision , we must stand against this push for centralization of power and technology .\nThe Great Reset is coming , and perhaps , it should come .\nWe have many issues facing our species that need to be addressed .\nHowever , central planning , surveillance , and loss of individual @ @ @ @ @ @ @ answer is decentralization , opting out en masse , non-compliance , and non-participation in the systems which have brought us to this predicament .\nWe , as free people , must decide what path we intend to take .\nWill we stand by and allow the predators to seize control of all resources and power for the coming generations ?\nOr , will we finally break free from their violent systems and initiate a Great Reset which benefits the people , from bottom to top ?\nThe answer depends on you .\nQuestion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nDerrick Broze , a staff writer for The Last American Vagabond , is a journalist ,

nature and forcibly organise a cult around their centralised power structures .\nSo , in the spirit of ruffling some feathers our journey begins in the poetic and fertile lands of Ireland that has produced some of the World \u2019 s literary titans , including the social visionary , George @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man of his word , Shaw was a prominent member of the Fabian Society .\nA founding organisation of the British Labour Party , who have since enjoyed a lasting effect on British politics .\nInspired by Marxist ideals the Fabians , devised a gradualist approach to reforming democracies .\nAvoiding the fortissimo emblazoned on the bloody red banner of the their radical counterparts in communism .\nPreferring instead to manipulate the democratic process by stealthier and more resolute degrees , best illustrated in their logos , the turtle .\nTo understand the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ glass window , designed by Bernard Shaw and displayed at the Fabian established London School of Economics .\nIt depicts the heroic Fabian leaders , ( Bernard Shaw in green frock coat ) , violently forging a new world out of the old with giant hammers .\nWhile a cadre of Fabians kneel worshipfully before a column of oversized Fabian literature .\nNote : the telling shield which depicts the ominous wolf in sheep \u2019 s clothing .\nAnother totem of Fabianism , which ironically lacks the subtlety of their otherwise aphonic scheme @ @ @ @ @ @ @ day \u2019 s intelligentsia , literati and high society at soirees , prevaricating down to earth working-class reform , such as selective breeding , scientific racism and sterilisation programs .\nApotheosizing how the cult of their far superior brains would ameliorate their downtrodden compadres from the working class .\nBut beneath their appearance as valiant defenders of working men , the Fabians were a den of vipers , who harboured the most savage contempt for the poorest of the poor , who would be dragged from their wretchedness , whether they liked it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brand of reform \u2013 that glimmered upon the social sphere like the razor-sharp edges of a gingerbread man \u2019 s ferocious cutter \u2013 socialism is therefore not the compassionate redeemer of working men .\nBut rather , the compulsory terms of their freedom .\nDesigned to ensnare the brooding discontent of the times , from a social segment that were the gravest threat to the particular brand of elitism , which the Fabians belonged to .\nThe Fabians were playmates with another scurrilous bunch of privileged gentlefolk who also missed the cultural zeitgeist @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in their determination to better the race , became the high priests of population control .\nOne of the co-founders of the Fabian Society , Havelock Ellis , who was also president of the Eugenics Education Society , and later became the mentor ( and lover ) of Margaret Sanger .\nHerself the founder of Planned Parenthood , which Bill Gates Senior ( another eugenicist ) was company head .\nLater , Bill Junior , would renew his father \u2019 s life \u2019 s work by investing billions of dollars into population @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Running with the same motif of scientific racism as Havelock and co .\nWhile playing god at the roulette wheel : the vaccine to sustain populations , and the pill to cut them short .\nEugenics was the grotesque creation of Charles Darwin \u2019 s cousin , Francis Galton .\nWho adapted Darwin \u2019 s theory of natural selection to suit his own fantasy \u2013 that society \u2019 s fate rested on its ability to breed more of the strong ( the fellow inhabitants of Galton \u2019 s own gene pool ) and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ encouraging those of greater intellectual ability to have more children while violently urging those of inferior stock \u2013 through programs like Planned Parenthood \u2013 to reproduce less often or not whatsoever .\nThe aim was to increase the overall quality of the national herd , by multiplying the wheat and weeding out the chaff .\nAnother affable eugenicist ( and fellow Fabian ) , was trade unionist and Labour MP Will Crooks , who said affectionately of the disabled working class \u2013 they were \u2018 like human vermin \u2019 who would \u2018 crawl @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and corrupting everything they touched \u2019 .\nSentiments that seem almost complimentary , compared to Bernard Shaw \u2019 s hideous contempt for what we called the \u2018 underclass \u2019 .\nBest characterised by his idea that , \u201c the only fundamental and possible socialism is the socialisation of the selective breeding of man \u201d .\nGoing on to say , the working classes had \u2018 no business to be alive \u2019 .\nAdvocating the use of a \u2018 lethal chamber \u2019 to solve this great burden to a prosperous society.\n\u2019 Shaw , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to soften his views even after witnessing the full horror of the eugenics-inspired Nazi death camps .\nWhich brings us to collectivism and its assault upon the individual\u2026 The Fabians first election manifesto for the labour party envisaged a government run by a \u2018 body of experts \u2019 .\nOr as Edward Pease put it \u2018 qualified rulers \u2019 .\nAccording to G.D.H .\nCole \u2013 \u2018 Bernard Shaw did not care a button about democracy and was apt to admire dictators , if only they would give the experts a free hand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Shaw kept a picture of Stalin on his mantelpiece .\nThe Fabians therefore aligned with all other branches of politicised socialism that view democracy not as an end in itself but as a means to achieve socialism .\nMarx himself regarded democracy as the very opposite of socialism , which would be \u2018 transitioned to through \u2018 the dictatorship of the proletariat \u2018 .\nIn fact , a ruling party of elites is considered the ideal structure for all forms of collectivism , whether Fabian socialism , Marxist communism or Hitler \u2019 s @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said that those who are ignorant of history are doomed to repeat its mistakes .\nSo , why then does socialism hold such cachet with those on the left , when it carries many hallmarks of the most abhorrent right-wing ideology ?\nPut simply , it is the cautionary tale that socialism would bring about a fairer , more egalitarian society , without class distinctions .\nProtect its weakest members , redistribute wealth and nationalise industry gone rogue under capitalism .\nAmongst those on the left therefore , socialism is the prized serum @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nWhile all of this looks well-proportioned on paper , it would be wise to ask the questions : ( 1 ) , What price must be paid for these protections ?\nAnd ( 2 ) , What are the consequences of the state flourishing beyond its legal residence \u2013 as a limited government that fosters individual freedom \u2013 to a tightly disciplined , highly organised , centralist regime , otherwise known as a dictatorship , that controls the means of production and interferes with the social , spiritual and economic fabric , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the modal for society under communism or socialism is compulsory .\nTo find the answer we can look to the one-party system of the Soviet Union .\nWhere under the Bolsheviks , only the Communist Party was permitted and even though voting was permissible in workers councils , in practice all candidates were pre-selected by the Party and its secret police .\nThe Bolsheviks were indeed a shrewd bunch who impaled human rights , and whitewashed culture through the most brutal social engineering programs of the 20th century towards a single state @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and any form of dissent was punished , often by death .\nIndependent political activities were prohibited , including participation in labour unions , independent churches or opposition political parties .\nMoreover , Lenin and Stalin used terror to exact civil-obedience and disappearances and mass murder was commonplace .\nIn fact , once the Bolsheviks seized power in the October revolution ( from the real revolutionaries ) , there followed one of the greatest bloodbaths in history to eliminate their opponents .\nWith Lenin enthusiastically declaring \u2018 it is a great deal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the thesis offered by the opposition \u2019 On the eve of his dictatorship , Lenin promised \u201c the proletarian state will begin to wither away immediately after its victory , because in a society without class antagonisms , the state is unnecessary and impossible \u201d Yet , unsurprisingly , once he seized power , Lenin did the very opposite .\nAccording to Eugene Lyons , a correspondent for United Press in revolutionary Russia , who began his career sympathetic to the Bolsheviks : Once the Bolsheviks attained power \u2018 most of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ revived , usually in more ominous forms , including : political prisoners convicted without trials or the formality of charges \u2019 .\nThere followed \u2018 savage persecution of dissenting views , death penalties for more varieties of crime than in any other modern nation , state monopoly on press and the most repressive practices which the previous monarchy had outlived for a century or more \u2019 Are you beginning to get the picture ?\nIt must be pointed out , the Bolsheviks are not alone , when , as a principle based on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ill-disposed to a free and empowered citizenry .\nInstead they firmly maintain : the public sphere needs to be governed with an iron hand .\nBecause left alone , the unbridled ideals of common people would bring about chaos and compromise the very bedrock of society , whose foundation stone is the state and whose substructure is formed by politicians , like barnacles enjoying the free ride .\nAuthoritarians are , above all , in-it for themselves , their own partisan views , or the club they belong to .\nIn their small @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must be arraigned with the sacrament of state consensus , towards collectivism .\nOtherwise known as socialism .\nThere is simply no place for diversity in this arrangement .\nIndividualism must be purged from the social fabric , because all citizens must pull their weight as cogs in the machinery .\nUnder socialism therefore , individualism is sacrificed at the political altar , so the collective may suffer their gruelling mass .\nDoes any of this sound familiar to our current predicament towards a hidden collectivism ?\nBest illustrated through the mandatory wearing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ proven not to reduce the spread of SARS-CoV-2 .\nWith refuseniks branded narcissists or psychopaths for disobeying petty diktats enforced by groupthink and under threat of a fine , through dubious legislative powers , called Statutory Instruments , which are , in the Fabian tradition , laws enacted undemocratically by small , conniving groups of \u2018 qualified rulers \u2019 , bearing more hallmarks of Leninism than Conservatism .\nNow let \u2019 s step into the jackboots of the political class to better understand their own motivations\u2026 As a threadbare minority forcibly ruling over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of their tenuous position .\nEspecially the potential for insurgency amongst non-confirming social groups .\nBecause if those citizens ever got round to lifting their blinkers , they would soon enough realise the gravity of their situation , and take it upon themselves to violently transform society , in a manner unfavourable to the state .\nThat would resolutely bring about the end of the political-age as we know it .\nAccordingly , politicians \u2019 resort to arcane methods of manipulation , counterinsurgency and divide and rule , in order to eliminate the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be under any false assumptions , politicians are not looking to dilute their market share , they are looking for full market capitalisation .\nOtherwise known as collectivism .\nWhich leads us to\u2026the enduring state of emergency \u2013 the modern era \u2019 s political weapon which armours the state \u2019 s tenuous position and robs the people of their power .\nFrom 9/11 , through climate change to the pandemic , the harvest of each event suspends democracy and compounds collectivism .\nThe rise of totalitarianism in Nazi Germany , for example , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for protections against a common threat .\nAs in the case of the burning down of the Reichstag .\nA practice that has been refined over 70-years , culminating in COVID-19 , the most politicized disease in history .\nThe key to understanding the power of emergencies in transforming individualism towards collectivism , is knowing the influence they have on the public sphere , called : mass hypnosis .\nWherein , under the emergency modal , citizens quickly forget the fundamental legal basis of government , and that is to protect individual freedom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to limit that freedom .\nThe US constitution , for example , is founded on the principle of a minimal government for and by the people .\nBecause the founding fathers knew too well the ambitious nature of the state towards centralisation would only result in tyranny , if the necessary checks and balances were removed .\nCausing the state to become the very predator it was mandated to protect the people \u2019 s liberty from .\nWe must also acknowledge \u2013 the state has always been a predator .\nWhether marauding despot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or legitimate authoritarian hiding behind the law .\nNot much has changed throughout history , with the exception of the methods used by the state to stalk more power .\nThese have indeed become more sophisticated .\nBecause with legitimacy , power becomes authority , skulking behind the virtues of democracy .\nWhich in times of emergencies ( or universal deceit ) , can be used to advance society towards collectivism .\nAs in the case of the Russian Revolution \u2013 that transferred power from the illegitimacy of the Tsar , to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our current predicament , where the British government has forcibly enlisted each and every one of us .\nThus , organising a cult around their centralised power structure , in the Bolshevik tradition , that means giving up our ill-conceived freedoms for protection against the pandemic .\nThis collectivism is achieved through the public \u2019 s inherent desire for a reputedly fairer and safer society and it is based on science .\nOr more precisely , the political establishment \u2019 s obsession with studying human nature as a specimen in a glass jar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , psychology and behaviourism , from the likes of Freud .\nThat makes government masters at operating our levers , especially those that drive us towards fear and groupthink , using the shock doctrine of emergency , that paints a pretty picture of salvation , waiting in the collectivist wings , once our consent is granted .\nThis is the gradualist approach to manipulating society : from the closure of non-essential shops , to the lockdown , to mandatory facemasks on public transport , to mandatory facemasks in all public spaces , to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ previous one .\nUntil the cannon smoke settles on the battlefield and we can clearly see Fabian devilry at work , as the public is taken through the labyrinth of monumental change , by a \u2018 body of experts .\nIn this instance , SAGE , Imperial College and the WHO .\nAs we shall explore in Part II .\nDustin Broadbery is an anarchist based in London , interested in social theory and particularly how a mutual society could bring about great advancements in the social

that has patients in its care using medical marijuana under state law are exempt from prosecution under the state \u2019 s marijuana laws .\nIn effect , the law ensures physicians recommending medical marijuana will be shielded from state prosecution .\nOn May 22 , the House passed HB418 by a 75-18 vote .\nThe Senate approved the measure on Friday 34-2 .\nThe House concurred with a technical

medical marijuana businesses , or from levying any penalties against banks or credit unions serving medical marijuana businesses .\nThe House passed HB211 by a 73-20 vote and the Senate approved the measure 29-0 .\nWith Edwards \u2019 signature , the law @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an Activist Post Patron for $ 1 per month at Patreon .\nWest Virginia enacted a similar law last year .\nThis legislation intended to allay fears that banks will be prosecuted or penalized for taking in marijuana-related accounts .\nThe Federal government has used banking laws as a weapon in its unconstitutional war on cannabis by making it impossible for marijuana businesses to access the banking system \u2013 even in states where marijuana has been legalized .\nThe feds can prosecute bankers for knowingly engaging with cannabis businesses under the Bank Secrecy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations ( RICO ) Act .\nWhile the enactment of HB211 can not stop federal prosecution of a Louisiana financial institution engaging in the medical marijuana business , it will provide some assurance that the state will shield it from financial loss and could create an environment where banks in the state are willing to handle medical marijuana funds .\nUnder the federal Controlled Substances Act ( CSA ) passed in 1970 , the federal government maintains complete prohibition of marijuana .\nOf course , the federal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or regulate cannabis within the borders of a state , despite the opinion of the politically connected lawyers on the Supreme Court .\nIf you doubt this , ask yourself why it took a constitutional amendment to institute federal alcohol prohibition .\nDespite federal prohibition , Louisiana legalized medical marijuana in 2015 , but there wasn \u2019 t any viable program in the state until the passage of two laws the following year .\nThe state expanded the program in 2018 .\nFurther expansion would remove yet another layer of laws punishing the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ state , but federal prohibition would remain in effect .\nThis is significant because FBI statistics show that law enforcement makes approximately 99 of 100 marijuana arrests under state , not federal law .\nWhen states stop enforcing marijuana laws , they sweep away most of the basis for 99 percent of marijuana arrests .\nFurthermore , figures indicate it would take 40 percent of the DEA \u2019 s yearly-budget just to investigate and raid all of the dispensaries in Los Angeles \u2013 a single city in a single state .\nThat doesn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nThe lesson ?\nThe feds lack the resources to enforce marijuana prohibition without state assistance .\nLouisiana joins a growing number of states increasingly ignoring federal prohibition , and nullifying it in practice .\nColorado , Washington state , Oregon and Alaska were the first states to legalize recreational cannabis , and California , Nevada , Maine and Massachusetts joined them after ballot initiatives in favor of legalization passed in November 2016 .\nMichigan followed suit when voters legalized cannabis for general use in 2018 .\nVermont became the first state to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 2018 .\nIllinois followed suit in 2019 .\nWith 33 states including allowing cannabis for medical use , the feds find themselves in a position where they simply can \u2019 t enforce prohibition anymore .\nThe lesson here is pretty straightforward .\nWhen enough people say , \u2018 No !\n\u2019 to the federal government , and enough states pass laws backing those people up , there \u2019 s not much the feds can do to shove their so-called laws , regulations or mandates down our throats .\nEfforts to expand medical marijuana @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reality .\nOnce a state legalizes marijuana \u2013 even if only in a very limited way \u2013 it tends to eventually expand .\nAs the state tears down some barriers , markets develop and demand expands .\nThat creates pressure to further relax state law

renewed hard lockdowns , meaning most Americans stay stuck at home for at least 6 weeks with little access to the economy .\nHis rationale ?\nThe US savings rate has spiked , therefore more Americans

is a suicide bomber seeking the deliberate destruction of the US in the name of an ideological cult ( globalism ) .\nFirst , the savings rate does not necessarily represent the majority of Americans .\nThe savings rate can increase dramatically due to a small subsection of the population , such as the upper middle class or the 1 % , setting large amounts of money aside , yet the statistics treat this as if it represents the whole population .\nThe Personal Savings Rate also includes stocks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which helps to skew the numbers as well .\nSecondly , with 30 million more Americans added to the unemployment rolls after the last lockdown , how can we take the recent increase in the savings rate seriously ?\nHow many average middle class or poverty stricken Americans are included in that stat ?\nThirdly , even if the Fed stat was accurate and most Americans were saving more , how is this an excuse to enforce even harsher lockdowns ?\nPeople generally save in order to prepare for

Reserve built the framework for the crash by addicting the system to easy debt through stimulus measures and low interest rates , then they took away the punch bowl triggering a bubble implosion , and now they are the world with punch until everyone drowns in the inflation .\nThe US economy was broken even without the pandemic lockdowns so there is no point in giving up your freedom or economic

A Delaware Corpooration et .\nal , Judge Ethan Schulman of the San Francisco Superior Court Drivers ordered Lyft and Uber to stop classifying drivers as independent contractors , rather than employees of the companies .\nFirst of all , a court has no constitutional or legal authority to order companies to force them to hire contractors \u2013 further evidence that California is not the land where liberty or the rule of law are respected or protected to any appreciable degree .\nUnder @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , drivers of Lyft and Uber can no longer operate as independent contractors , as doing so violates California \u2019 s draconian labor laws .\nWhile drivers will get more \u201c benefits \u201d , like minimum wage , health insurance , unemployment insurance , overtime pay , etc.\n, like everything , it comes at a steep cost , and is therefore anything but free .\nWhile the courts ruled that Lyft and Uber can still let drivers have flexible hours , there are now a bunch of more costly extra benefits that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drivers .\nThis will inevitably push costs up , which will ultimately be passed down to riders and drivers .\nFirst of all , some current drivers will be laid off , and fewer new ones will get hired .\nFurthermore , riders will likely have to pay higher fares for rides , as Lyft and Uber , like every other company , will pass on these legally mandated business costs to end-customers , the riders .\nIf ride fares increase , fewer people will ride , further hurting Lyft and Uber financially @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like far too many today , are struggling mightily to make a profit or generate positive cash flow .\nA further adverse implication of this ruling is that under California labor laws , Uber and Lyft will MOST LIKELY be required to buy and provide cars to its drivers , who now must be employees .\nBut if Uber can no longer avoid the gargantuan capital investment of cars , something that enabled it to disrupt the ride service industry to the all-around benefit of the economy , then they won \u2019 t @ @ @ @ @ @ @ companies , further pushing Lyft and Uber closer to closing permanently , something that nobody wants .\nThis will further exacerbate the poverty that California politicians have already imposed on residents by irrationally , tyrannically and unconstitutionally shutting down commerce ( aside from \u201c essential services \u201d ) , causing many to lose their jobs and turn to driving Lyft/Uber to try to survive financially .\nThe ability to drive as independent contractors makes Lyft/Uber more viable as a back-up , as it is far easier to start driving and earning money faster @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , rather than having to drive and be hired as typical W-2 Employees .\nSee : 177 Different Ways to Generate Extra Income The biggest reason everyone , especially everybody who lives in California , should be extremely concerned is that this ruling could push Uber and Lyft out of California .\nAlready , Uber CEO Dara Khosrowshahi is considering suspending Uber until the November election , at which point voters will have a chance to pass Proposition 22 , which would exempt drivers from the restrictions of AB 5 .\nSo what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with all these economic issues , let liberty prevail , and abolish AB 5 .\nAB 5 is a coercive law that forces , and thereby coerces , Lyft and Uber to only hire employees and forcibly restricts them from contracting with willing drivers .\nAB 5 therefore violates liberty , and should therefore have never became law .\nLet drivers negotiate with Lyft and Uber .\nIf they want benefits for lower pay per ride , then they should be free to negotiate such arrangements and vice-versa .\nIndependent contracting of drivers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to enjoy ride-share services at much lower costs than before the creation of Lyft and Uber .\nThat joy is now in grave jeopardy of evaporating !\nUber and Lyft are naturally and rightfully appealing the ruling , but with a very low probability of success .\nCalifornia is not friendly to enterprises or anybody trying to earn more income .\nLyft and Uber provided a new ride-share service platform that has massively benefited the economy , and their entrance into the market marked an advancement and achievement for civilization .\nYour beloved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ great advancement , just because Lyft and Uber violate unreasonable liberty-violating state labor laws , like AB 5 .\nI previously wrote about AB-5 here , the newly passed law in California that requires ride-share companies , like Lyft and Uber , to classify their drivers as typical W-2 employees rather than contractors .\nIn November 2020 , California voters will have the chance to vote for Proposition 22 , which would exempt drivers from the draconian , liberty-violating ,

are clinging to control however they can .\nFrom sending Child Protective Services ( CPS ) agents to investigate charges of neglect in homes where children missed Zoom classes last spring , to proposing \u201c child wellbeing checks \u201d in homes this fall , government schools and related agencies are panicking over parents having increased influence over their children \u2019 s care and education during the pandemic .\nA front page article in yesterday \u2019 s Boston Sunday Globe describes the experiences of several @ @ @ @ @ @ @ last spring when their children missed remote classes or failed to submit homework assignments amidst pandemic-related school shutdowns .\nSome parents didn \u2019 t have Internet access and were blindsided by the CPS investigations of \u201c virtual truancy.\n\u201d One Latina mother featured in the Globe story is Em Quiles , who , like many parents last spring , scrambled to care for her children and continue to work during tremendous upheaval and uncertainty .\nAccording to the Globe : Then in June , Quiles was stunned to receive a call from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Families .\nThe school had accused Quiles of neglect , she was told , because the 7-year-old missed class and homework assignments .\n\u201c I couldn \u2019 t believe it , \u201d she said .\nQuiles lived one of the worst nightmares for a parent : A neglect charge , if substantiated , can lead to removing a child from their home .\nWhile most of the parents featured in the Globe story were ultimately exonerated , previous interaction with CPS , even if unfounded , can act as a Scarlet Letter for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ come .\nMore troubling , parents singled out for CPS enforcement are disproportionately low-income and minority , often lacking the resources to defend themselves against government overreach .\nAccording to the Globe : \u201c Most of the families caught up in remote learning allegations are Latino or Black , groups that are likely to be overrepresented in state foster care at all times.\n\u201d School districts across the country have a history of activating CPS against parents who stray from a district \u2019 s command and control .\nAn in-depth 2018 investigative report @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that schools increasingly use child protective services as a \u201c weapon against parents \u201d \u2014especially parents who lack the means to fight back .\nTruancy has long been a trigger for CPS investigations , and now virtual truancy seems poised to accelerate these practices during the pandemic .\nThis is particularly concerning because , just as in typical truancy cases , virtual truancy is often prompted by factors other than parental neglect .\nSpecial needs students and students with disabilities or health conditions may have more school absences , and they may find @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A 2019 HuffPost article entitled The Human Costs of Kamala Harris \u2019 War on Truancy , found that strict truancy laws and enforcement terrorized families , with parents being pulled out of their homes in handcuffs and sent to jail .\nCheree Peoples , one of the parents spotlighted in the HuffPot piece , whose daughter missed school frequently due to sickle cell anemia , was awakened in the early hours by police officers who arrested her for truancy .\nShe told the HuffPost : \u201c You would swear I had killed somebody.\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ then Democratic presidential candidate and now the presumptive Democratic vice presidential nominee , Kamala Harris , was responsible for much of the heightened aggression toward parents regarding truancy .\nAs California \u2019 s attorney general , Harris was a crusader against truancy and was instrumental in toughening criminal prosecution of parents whose children missed too much school .\nAccording to HuffPost , Harris \u201c persuaded the state legislature to adopt harsher penalties for truancy .\nUnder the new law , the parent or guardian of a young , truant child could face a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or one year in jail .\nHarris pushed hard for the law as she was running for attorney general , and it passed just as she won the election .\n\u2018 We are putting parents on notice , \u2019 Harris said at her 2011 inauguration.\n\u201d Criminal investigations of child neglect tied to virtual truancy are set to skyrocket this fall , as school districts across the country adopt remote learning plans .\nWorried that parents can \u2019 t be trusted to care for their own children , some education officials have proposed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u201d by government agents .\nLast week , the Tennessee Department of Education announced that it would be performing these wellbeing checks on children across the state .\nThis plan created such an uproar among Tennessee parents and conservative lawmakers that the proposed initiative was withdrawn and its guidelines removed from the education department \u2019 s website .\nDespite this immediate victory , all parents should remain on alert .\nSchool and state officials , aided by high-profile academics , will likely seek to increase CPS involvement in family affairs during remote learning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Harvard Law School professor who made headlines last spring when she called for a presumptive ban on homeschooling , spoke out last week in favor of increased CPS action this fall .\nIn an interview with Harvard Law Today , Bartholet said : \u201c My overall general recommendation is that educators and CPS agencies need to recognize the level of problems that kids at home are now facing in terms of risk of both education and maltreatment , and come up with some creative new solutions.\n\u201d In the interview , Bartholet acknowledged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as more parents choose to forgo district learning this fall and consider separating from their school district going forward .\nAccording to Bartholet : \u201c Roughly three percent of the population is now homeschooled .\nLet \u2019 s say that increases to six percent post-COVID .\nLegislators and other policymakers may look at that and say , \u2018 Wow , now this is a big phenomenon , it may continue to grow .\nOf course , it shouldn \u2019 t be just this lawless world out there with no rules and regulations and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be part of our overall regulated educational system.\n\u2019 \u201d As I \u2019 ve written previously , homeschooling should not be part of the overall regulated education system .\nIt is a form of private education that is separate and distinct from state schooling , and many parents are now finding that they prefer homeschooling over other education options .\nParents are pulling their children out of school this fall in record numbers , dissatisfied with school reopening plans and aiming for greater educational freedom and flexibility .\nSo many parents submitted online @ @ @ @ @ @ @ last month that it crashed the state \u2019 s nonpublic education website .\nPerhaps not surprisingly , a recent report by a law professor at North Carolina \u2019 s Duke University called for greater regulation and oversight of the state \u2019 s growing ranks of homeschoolers .\nAs parents pull away from state-controlled education and assume greater responsibility for their children \u2019 s learning , the state will hasten efforts to maintain and expand its authority through its monopoly on the use of force .\nFrom virtual truancy claims and increased CPS investigations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of color , to calls for child wellbeing checks and more homeschooling regulations , the state will not willingly yield control of children \u2019 s education to parents .\nParents should strongly reject these heavy-handed efforts to interfere with family life during and after the pandemic , and be especially vigilant about helping low-income and minority parents to resist as well .\nMinimizing state power while maximizing individual liberty is the hallmark of a free society .\nNow more than ever , parents are exercising and securing their

system where university members can report \u201c problematic behavior \u201d related to COVID-19 , and depending on the circumstance , are asked to call the university police .\n\u201c Do you really want to be the reason that Tulane and New Orleans have to shut down again ?\n\u201d Tulane Dean of Students Erica Woodly wrote on the reporting page announcement .\nYale University is even encouraging students to \u201c make reports concerning COVID-19 \u201d to the university hotline .\nThe University of North Georgia has set @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Others Form , \u201d which prompted a letter to the university from the Southeastern Legal Foundation , which claims that the form may violate students \u2019 right to privacy and could possibly censor speech .\n\u201c Colleges have a duty to protect student health and safety , especially during uncertain times like these .\nHowever , even in unprecedented times , students \u2019 First Amendment rights remain unchanged .\nThat means colleges and universities can not engage in viewpoint or content-based discrimination , can not enact vague and overbroad policies , and can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ letter stated .\n\u201c With a Concern Form at students \u2019 fingertips , students wishing to prevent a controversial speaker from visiting campus or to stop a student organization from garnering interest in their cause can simply report members of that organization as symptomatic .\nWithout stricter reporting guidelines and limits , it appears that such events could be shut down entirely with the press of a button .\nThis may sound unlikely , but then again , who would have predicted 2020 to turn out as it has ?\n\u201d the letter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the form could violate students \u2019 Fourth Amendment rights by forcing students to get tested for COVID-19 , even when there is no cause .\nActivist Post Recommended Book : Snitch Culture : How Citizens Are Turned Into The Eyes And Ears Of The State \u201c Under the Fourth Amendment , individuals can not be subject to unreasonable searches and seizures .\nThe Supreme Court has even considered that right in the context of cheek swabs .\nThe Court has held that a criminal arrested and charged with a serious crime can be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so long as the charges are supported by probable cause , meaning there must be sufficient likelihood that the crime occurred .\nHowever , a swab is unconstitutional if there is no probable cause , the charge is not criminal , or if the DNA is used to gather medical information about the criminal , \u201d SLF explained .\n\u201c Will UNG , upon receiving a report of a symptomatic student , subject that student to an invasive COVID-19 swab ?\nSurely the university understands that this action would violate the Fourth Amendment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ addition to encouraging other students to report their peers if they have concerns about their possible exposure to COVID-19 , other schools are implementing different student volunteer programs to reduce the spread of the virus .\nColumbia University , for example , is implementing a \u201c Student Ambassador \u201d program , where students will become a \u201c peer leader \u201d and \u201c expert \u201d on \u201c COVID-19 prevention , the Columbia Community Health Compact and resources for students.\n\u201d The University of Denver is taking things a step further and is requiring students @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mobile devices \u201d that will track their location to aid with contact tracing efforts , as Campus Reform previously reported .\nWhile universities across the country are involving students in their COVID-19 prevention plans , two Ivy League academics urged universities to not make students \u201c the coronavirus police \u201d in a New York Times op-ed .\nKaren Levy , an assistant professor at Cornell University and Lauren Kilgour , a doctoral candidate at Cornell both agree that involving students \u201c makes sense , \u201d but that the systems may not be very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tough positions.\n\u201d \u201c Of course , many students understand the high stakes of a coronavirus outbreak and have a desire to help keep their communities safe .\nSome students may feel a sense of civic duty to participate in policing their classmates \u2019 behavior , \u201d they wrote .\n\u201c But others may be loath to report on their friends , especially when doing so could result in harsh penalties.\n\u201d \u201c People report on one another ( truthfully or falsely ) for a number of personal reasons , including competition , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There \u2019 s every reason to assume that these motivations will bubble up in the college context , too .\nStudents have their own loyalties , broken hearts , rocky roommate relationships and fraternity codes of silence , \u201d

of newly unemployed Americans fearful about their future in an economy transformed by the covid pandemic , Deutsche Bank \u2019 s Jim Reid made a remarkable observation : \u201c Recessions don \u2019 t usually result in personal income soaring , but this one has thanks to government support around the world.\n\u201d This was shown in the following chart : This was not a surprise : as Bank of America writes , one of the regular features of US recessions since the 1950s is that they always trigger , with a bit of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nIn normal times , benefits in the US are lower than for most other developed market economies , but there is an attempt to close some of the gap during the recession .\nIn recent recessions the additional benefits have tended to be earlier , bigger and last longer .\nThus benefits weren \u2019 t enhanced until the end of the 2001 recession and provided 13 weeks of additional benefits through Mar 2004 .\nHowever , for the Great Recession of 2008-9 enhanced benefits were enacted on July 2008 , a year @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lasting through December 2013 , with the unemployment rate down to 6.7 % .\nInitially , the response to this crisis continued the trend toward stronger responses .\nFacing a much deeper and faster recession , enhanced benefits were almost immediately implemented and included a large bonus benefit of $ 600/week .\nUnfortunately , 4 months later and policy has taken a 180-degree turn : the benefit has been allowed to expire with an unemployment rate still north of 10 % .\nNeedless to say , it seems a bit early to declare @ @ @ @ @ @ @ US is now caught in an unprecedented dilemma \u2013 as BofA also notes , \u201c Absent government support disposable income would have fallen the most in history ; with that support it has risen the most in history.\n\u201d So what \u2019 s Congress \u2013 and the President \u2013 to do ?\nWell , while the full impact of this economic transformation has yet to be felt across the country , at least for some the government support ended on July 31 when the infamous \u201c fiscal cliff \u201d hit and has yet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ orders signed by Trump two weeks ago have offset only a modest portion of the stimulus ) .\nThe group most directly affected are recipients of unemployment insurance ( UI ) who have seen a notable reduction in income .\nTo quantify the impact , Bank of America examined spending trends of the population of card holders who receive UI through ACH ( direct deposit ) and compared to all other households .\nWhat it found was a dramatic divergence as the YOY rate of growth for UI recipients slowed dramatically but increased @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nSee : 177 Different Ways to Generate Extra Income By income , over the past two weeks , the YOY growth rate slowed by 12 % for the unemployed cohort ( formerly ) earning under $ 50K vs. a roughly 5 % drop for the middle and upper income cohorts .\nSome more math : a closer look at the US household income statement underscores the resulting hole in household income as a result of the lapsing of the fiscal stimulus .\nThe $ 600/week benefit was not a small support to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than 60 % of unemployment benefits in June ( Chart 1 ) .\nAs the numbers on the chart indicate , that means a payment equivalent to about 5 % of household income just disappeared .\nWe don \u2019 t have data yet for July and August , but the daily treasury statement confirms the collapse in payments ( Chart 2 ) .\nIn July the average daily outlay was $ 4.8bn , in the past five working days it has collapsed to $ 2.3bn , or a drop of more than half @ @ @ @ @ @ @ charts show just how reliant on the government much of America has become .\nTo be sure , much has been made about the resilience of the consumer so far in this crisis .\nIndeed , while services spending remains depressed , retail sales have fully recovered .\nHowever , as shown above , this recovery is deeply dependent on fiscal support .\nThe next chart decomposes the various sources of income in recent months-unemployment benefits , other tax and transfer benefits , labor income , proprietors income and other income .\nAnd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : \u201c Absent government support disposable income would have fallen the most in history ; with that support it has risen the most in history.\n\u201d Note that the role of government stimulus is even bigger because the surge in proprietors \u2019 income was due to another ( now fading ) federal program-the Paycheck Protection Program .\nSo just how much of a hit to consumption \u2013 which represents 70 % of US GDP \u2013 is coming ?\nWell besides the already noted slump in spending by unemployed Americans , it will take @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the lost payments on consumer spending since presumably some recipients have savings or can postpone rent , credit card and other bills .\nThe early evidence suggests \u201c a moderate shock \u201d according to BofA which again notes \u2013 see chart 4 above \u2013 that among the unemployed , lower income groups were among the hardest hit , with the YOY growth rate slowing by 12 % for the cohort earning under $ 50K vs. a roughly 5pp drop for the middle and upper income cohorts .\nWhile the bank has not done @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the lost fiscal stimulus , a simple illustrative example from the Petersen Institute can give a sense of the magnitude .\nFirst , they assume that 20MM people were unemployed at the end of July and that the $ 600 benefit has a fiscal multiplier of 1.5 ( around the midpoint of the CBO \u2019 s range of estimates ) .\nThe expiration of the $ 600/weekly benefit would therefore remove about $ 50bn in income from the economy per month .\nBy their estimate , this would result in about a 2.5 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ jobs over the next year and a 1.2pp increase in the unemployment rate .\nAs BofA summarizes \u201c while illustrative , these are staggering numbers.\n\u201d Moreover , based on the latest claims data there were around 15MM people on standard unemployment benefits as of the week ending August 8 with millions more in other programs such as Pandemic Unemployment Assistance ( PUA ) .\nThus , the full impact will likely be even more acute than modeled by BofA .\nThe final question is whether President Trump \u2019 s executive orders can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u2019 s look first at the unemployment benefits and then at executive orders as a group .\nThe executive order earmarks the $ 44bn in remaining FEMA funds for unemployment benefits of $ 300/week .\nIn addition , initially it required states to provide $ 100/week in matching funds , but that requirement was dropped as it became clear that it would deter cash-strapped states from participating .\nSince the program is new it will take time for states to set up the new system , and indeed as we pointed out earlier @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so far signed up for the $ 300 unemployment stimulus plan .\nHopefully , a number of states will have the program up and running by the September 1 launch date .\nWhile this new payment cuts the income shock in half , the funds are likely to only be enough to cover a month or so or into early October , one month ahead of the elections .\nMoreover , the order is backdated to start on Aug 1 .\nSo in practice , the funds may be disbursed quickly after states @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other major executive order is the deferral in the employee component of the payroll tax from September 1 until December 31 .\nObjectively , this will provide very little support to consumer spending , and as we also noted earlier , business lobbies are already complaining that the program is \u201c unworkable \u201d \u2013 a letter co-signed by a number of groups including the US Chamber of Commerce , the National Retail Federation , the National Association of Manufactures and others argued that ( 1 ) the order would result in a significant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( 2 ) the implementation of the order is unworkable and ( 3 ) many members expect to decline to actually adopt the deferral .\nEven for workers at firms that do implement the deferral the impact on spending will likely be very small .\nHouseholds that are not in financial distress will save most of the tax cut in anticipation of a big bill at tax year end .\nOf course , workers who are in distress due to unemployment will not benefit from cutting a tax they are not paying .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ households that remain cash strapped even though they are still employed .\nPresumably they will spend a good part of the tax cut .\nWhat happens next ?\nAs we have reported almost every day for the past three weeks , Congressional negotiations seem hopelessly bogged down and furthermore , Congress is currently on recess with funding the post office has become a major distraction .\nBoth parties are having their conventions .\nBoth parties are watching to see if the executive orders work .\nAnd an election looms .\nAs BofA \u2019 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hoped for a deal this month , \u201c increasingly it looks like one only comes after Labor Day and after demonstrable pain in the economy.\n\u201d Unfortunately , in a world in which the market no longer reflects the economy , it is unclear just what signal US politicians will seek to determine that the economy is \u201c in pain.\n\u201d Ironically , this will make the disconnect between the soaring market which just hit a fresh all-time high and the economy which is about to double dip , even more grotesque .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ peace , and freedom news .\nSend resources to the front lines of peace and freedom

Washington Post , \u201c Government is everywhere now .\nWhere does @ @ @ @ @ @ @ comes to the power players that call the shots , there is no end to their voracious appetite for more : more money , more power , more control .\nThis expansion of government power is also increasing our federal debt in unprecedented leaps and bounds .\nYet the government isn \u2019 t just borrowing outrageous amounts of money to keep the country afloat .\nIt \u2019 s also borrowing indecent sums to pay for programs it can \u2019 t afford .\nThe government \u2019 s primary response to this COVID-19 pandemic\u2014flooding the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of trillions of dollars for stimulus payments , unemployment insurance expansions , and loans to prop up small businesses and to keep big companies

expanded the nation \u2019 s debt .\nWhen President Trump took office on January 20 , 2017 , the national debt\u2014the amount the federal government has borrowed over the years and must pay back\u2014was a whopping $ 19.9 trillion .\nDespite Trump \u2019 s pledge to drain the swamp and eliminate the debt , the federal debt is now approaching $ 27 trillion and is on track to surpass $ 78 trillion by 2028 .\nFor many years now , economists have warned that economic collapse would be inevitable if the national @ @ @ @ @ @ @ U.S. economy .\nThe government passed that point in June 2020 and has yet to put the brakes on its spending .\nIn fact , the Federal Reserve just keeps printing more money in order to prop up the economy and float the debt .\nAt some point , something \u2019 s got to give .\nSee : 177 Different Ways to Generate Extra Income As it now stands , the U.S. is among the most indebted countries in the world .\nAlmost a third of the $ 27 trillion national debt is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and China .\nMost of the debt , however , is owed to the public .\nHow is this even possible ?\nEssentially , it \u2019 s a case of robbing Peter to pay Paul .\nFirst , the government requires taxpayers to pay a portion of their salaries to the Social Security Trust Fund .\nThe government then turns around and borrows from Social Security to cover its spending needs .\nThen the government raises taxes or prints more money in order to pay out whatever is needed to the retirees .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ economics that only makes sense to government bureaucrats looking to make a profit off the backs of the taxpayers .\nAccording to the U.S. Debt Clock , each taxpayer \u2019 s share of the national debt is $ 214,000 and growing .\nThat \u2019 s almost five times more than the median income for what Americans earn in a year .\nThat \u2019 s also almost five times more than the average American has in savings , across savings accounts , checking accounts , money market accounts , call deposit accounts , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Americans are so financially strapped that they don \u2019 t have even $ 500 in savings and nothing whatsoever put away for retirement .\nJust the interest that must be paid on the national debt every year is $ 338 billion and growing .\nAccording to the Congressional Budget Office , the fastest growing item in the budget over the next decade will be interest on the debt .\nAs the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget reported in 2019 , before COVID spending pushed the country over the fiscal cliff , \u201c @ @ @ @ @ @ @ billion last year to $ 928 billion by 2029 , a nearly threefold increase .\nIf tax cuts and spending increases are extended , interest will exceed $ 1 trillion and set a new record as a share of the economy .\nThe federal government will spend more on interest than on Medicaid or children by 2020 .\nBy 2024 , interest will match defense spending.\n\u201d Bottom line : The U.S. government\u2014and that includes the current administration\u2014is spending money it doesn \u2019 t have on programs it can \u2019 t afford , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ones who will have to pay for it .\nAs financial analyst Kristin Tate explains , \u201c When the government has its debt bill come due , all of us will be on the hook.\n\u201d Despite the tax burden \u201c we the people \u201d are made to bear , we have no real say in

plight of its citizens .\nThis brings me to a curious point : what the future will look like ten @ @ @ @ @ @ @ debt is expected to surpass $ 78 trillion , an unsustainable level of debt that will result in unprecedented economic hardship for anyone that does not belong to the wealthy elite .\nInterestingly enough , that timeline coincides with the government \u2019 s vision of the future as depicted in a Pentagon training video created by the Army for U.S. Special Operations Command .\nAccording to the video , the government is anticipating trouble ( read : civil unrest ) , which is code for anything that challenges the government \u2019 s authority @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grooming its armed forces ( including its heavily armed federal agents ) accordingly to solve future domestic political and social problems .\nThe training video , titled \u201c Megacities : Urban Future , the Emerging Complexity , \u201d is only five minutes long , but it provides a chilling glimpse of what the government expects the world to look like in 2030 , a world bedeviled by \u201c criminal networks , \u201d \u201c substandard infrastructure , \u201d \u201c religious and ethnic tensions , \u201d \u201c impoverishment , slums , \u201d \u201c open landfills @ @ @ @ @ @ @ growing mass of unemployed , \u201d and an urban landscape in which the prosperous economic elite must be protected from the impoverishment of the have nots .\nAnd then comes the kicker .\nThree-and-a-half minutes into the Pentagon \u2019 s dystopian vision of \u201c a world of Robert Kaplan-esque urban hellscapes \u2014 brutal and anarchic supercities filled with gangs of youth-gone-wild , a restive underclass , criminal syndicates , and bands of malicious hackers , \u201d the ominous voice of the narrator speaks of a need to \u201c drain the swamps.\n\u201d Emblazoned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rallies , and used as a rallying cry among Trump supporters , \u201c drain the swamp \u201d became one of Donald Trump \u2019 s most-used campaign slogans .\nFar from draining the politically corrupt swamps of Washington DC of lobbyists and special interest groups , however , the Trump Administration has further mired us in a sweltering bog of corruption and self-serving tactics .\nFunny how the more things change , the more they stay the same .\nNow the government has adopted its own plans for swamp-draining , only it wants to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of futuristic urban American cities of \u201c noncombatants and engage the remaining adversaries in high intensity conflict within.\n\u201d And who are these noncombatants , a military term that refers to civilians who are not engaged in fighting during a war ?\nThey are , according to the Pentagon , \u201c adversaries.\n\u201d They are the \u201c enemy.\n\u201d They are

wireless Internet of Things ( IoT ) modules that can severely compromise medical devices and \u201c wreck \u201d utility \u201c Smart \u201d Meters .\nThis isn \u2019 t really surprising \u2013 security expert warnings about IoT go back several years and there are countless examples of past and recent hacks ( see 1 , 2 , 3 ) .\nToday there seems to be no avoiding the risks and consequences from 5G and IoT technology being installed everywhere , whereas a few years ago people were still weighing the advantages and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ smart \u201d enabled home .\nHome Monitoring Will Soon Monitor You When the Internet of Things begins to track electrical usage , houses could become more measured\u2014and scrutinized\u2014than ever .\nI worry .\nAbout my family .\nMy house .\nMy dumb possessions , and my treasured ones .\nDoesn \u2019 t everyone ?\n\u201c Happiness , \u201d Don Draper opines in Mad Men \u2019 s pilot , \u201c is the freedom from fear.\n\u201d Companies sell people solutions to those fears\u2014even if they are contrived ones .\nListerine , invented to cure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , whose kicks are used for sloth more than athleticism .\nApple , whose modernist , glass-and-aluminum shields hide compulsion .\nJust as people originally bought mobile phones to protect against hypothetical emergencies , so internet-connected smart devices now often sell comfort from fear .\nMotion cameras that deter evil babysitters .\nRecording doorbells that stave off solicitors and burglars .\nPropane scales that avert cook-out disaster .\nSensor-tentacled boxes that warn against flooding .\nIndividually , such fears and their solutions are harmless at best , vain at worst .\nBut when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are real reasons for concern .\nWhen it comes to smart devices , that includes profound security deficiencies\u2014exemplified by the recent botnet attack that used insecure cable boxes and internet cameras to take down DNS services .\nYet the total vision promised by the Internet of Things trades the uncertainty of fear for the certainty of scrutiny .\nTo watch everything with gadgets necessitates that they also be able to watch you watching .\nEven more than you think they already can .\nI \u2019 m looking at an app called Sense on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ graph of my home \u2019 s electrical usage .\nI flick a light switch on and the graph climbs a little .\nThe data is captured by a power-usage meter installed on my electrical main\u2014a small , red box with a wireless antenna that connects to the internet , and thereby to Sense \u2019 s service and app .\nAnother view shows bubbles representing the individual devices and appliances that are currently using electricity in my house .\nAn HVAC unit occupies the biggest bubble , then the oven ( we \u2019 re @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nI flip the light switch off , and the light bubble in the Sense app disappears , like magic .\nMy lights and oven aren \u2019 t connected to the internet , but now that my electrical main is , Sense knows when I \u2019 m using certain devices , for how long , and how much energy they consume in the process .\nThis type of signal processing is called energy load disaggregation , sometimes also known as nonintrusive load monitoring , and it \u2019 s been around since the 1980s @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or \u201c disaggregate , \u201d the total electrical load in a building into its constituent parts\u2014air conditioning , appliances , lighting , and so forth .\nTraditionally , load disaggregation has been used to monitor residential and commercial usage and efficiency .\nBut Sense Labs , the Cambridge-based startup who loaned me their device to install in my circuit box , has something bigger and weirder in mind .\nMike Phillips , Sense \u2019 s CEO , has a background in speech recognition .\nHis company SpeechWorks , which went public in 2000 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ automated corporate phone systems .\nSome of the same approaches that can help computers recognize and understand speech can be applied to electricity , it turns out .\nSense does load disaggregation by detecting small changes in the electrical voltage and current at the main breaker to identify the signatures of individual devices .\nTo improve the quality of recognition , signature-detection is aided by machine learning : By sharing the patterns found among all electrical devices detected by every individual Sense-enabled residence , the service can recognize more electrical appliances with greater @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Sense seems like it might be useful only to obsessives : Those intent to connect everything in their homes to the internet just to be able to stroke them on a smartphone , those inclined to micromanage electrical usage in order to reduce their home \u2019 s cost and energy footprint , or those who regularly worry about leaving the oven or the iron on .\nBut Sense Labs is looking beyond parsimony and pathology .\nEven if the apparent value of disaggregation comes from tracking energy usage , Phillips explains to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a signal for what \u2019 s going on in your house .\nFor example , if Sense users see the TV turn on at 4 p.m. , they might take it as a sign that the kids are safely home from school .\nIf the oven turns on , they \u2019 d know that a spouse actually remembered to put the chicken in the oven .\nChecking when the garage door opened last night could confirm whether the teenager got home by curfew last night .\nFrom there , Sense eventually hopes to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Some of these functions might take the place of other , more ad-hoc gadgets currently in homes .\nFor example , one common early-Internet-of-Things application is the Wi-Fi-connected moisture sensor .\nJust drop a device like Twine into the basement and it can send a text message in the event of flooding .\nBut with Sense , the same feat could be accomplished by monitoring the sump pump instead .\nSense \u2019 s website offers a host of promising applications of the technology , including reporting when the wash is done , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a week .\nEventually , it might also switch internet-connected devices on or off .\nIn practice , however , even synthetic reports , like a wash-is-done notification , are a far away ; for now , the app just displays a list of on-and-off events for the various devices it identifies .\nAnd that \u2019 s if it identifies them at all .\nSense begins finding a home \u2019 s devices within a few days , and Phillips estimates that a relatively complete set should emerge in a month or so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Sense \u2019 s picture of my home hardly feels complete .\nOnly a few lights ever show up , for example , and some devices ghost in and out of existence .\nIn contrast to the immediate gratification of most internet gadgets , Sense is slow and semi-permanent .\nThe device requires professional installation by an electrician ( so as to avoid possible electrocution ) .\nOnce set up , Sense needs a Wi-Fi signal to operate correctly , but the basements , garages , and other out-of-the-way places where the main @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nearby the home \u2019 s Wi-Fi router .\nSense tells me that they \u2019 re considering a wired option , but homeowners don \u2019 t generally wire Ethernet to their breaker boxes , either .\nStill , it \u2019 s early days for automated consumer load aggregation .\nThe precision of disaggregation available in the Sense service needs time to mature , which it will if more people install the device , allowing the machine-learning backend to bolster the service \u2019 s overall knowledge .\nSense feels like the start of something new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that future requires that Sense offers a service compelling enough that consumer will be willing to install the device semi-permanently into their home \u2019 s electrical grid .\nAt a time when Internet-of-Things devices have been responsible for nationwide DDoS attacks and drone-enabled , cascading smart lightbulb hacks , security and privacy might offer the greatest obstacles to its adoption .\nOn the security front , Sense represents a theoretical improvement over standard-fare Internet of Things , which are often poorly engineered for security and installed in large numbers .\nBy moving sensing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the electrical main , the possible points of attack are reduced\u2014so long as the Sense itself doesn \u2019 t get hacked .\nBut when it comes to privacy , things are more complicated .\nAfter all , Sense listens in on and records every electrical apparatus in the home .\nThat \u2019 s a lot of potentially invasive\u2014and valuable\u2014data .\nEarly adopters of the Nest smart thermostat embraced that device without fully considering the implications of its capacity to monitor presence in the home .\nWhen Google bought Nest for $ 3.2 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ability to merge that internal view of the home with everything else Google already knows about its users\u2014their web searches , the places they \u2019 ve visited , and so forth .\nSense offers a similar opportunity to slurp up live , granular data on everything people do with electricity in their homes\u2014which is most everything , these days .\nNest knows the general patterns of occupancy in a home , but for anyone with smartphone running Google services like Maps , the company probably knew those patterns already .\nSense , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make use of individual appliances , lights , and devices\u2014how often , and for how long .\nMonitoring the garage door or the oven might seem innocuous , until one considers the fact that big data is already being used for purposes like insurance and loan underwriting .\nThe frequency and time of day of garage use offers new ways to evaluate and confirm a household \u2019 s automotive risk , based on how often they appear to be driving and at what times of day .\nAnd the use ( or disuse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or blender or microwave could be used to draw conclusions about a home \u2019 s cooking tendencies , and thereby its occupants \u2019 general health .\nOwn a table saw or a Hitachi magic wand ?\nYour insurer\u2014or your employer\u2014might want to know about that , too .\nA job candidate who runs a clothes iron regularly might appear more desirable than one who runs a \u201c personal massager \u201d daily .\nLikewise , a warehouse pick-and-pack runner who spends days off using power tools might prove a less desirable employee than one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The commercial applications of load disaggregation are also plentiful .\nImagine if Amazon or Walmart or Google knew not just what consumers search for and buy , but also what ordinary , non-electronic products they already own , and how often they use them .\nSomeone \u2019 s porn-viewing predilections could be correlated against their toasting habits .\nTheir sleep patterns\u2014determined by lamp or television usage\u2014could be compared to their proclivity for online impulse purchases .\nDo people who use electric razors daily tend to buy boxers , while those who do so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Facebook might know and serve the proper ad accordingly .\nFor now , such granularity is impossible with Sense .\nBut over time , load disaggregation \u2019 s potential will improve .\nAnd not just because of machine learning , but also because disaggregation could end up getting baked into products\u2014and even the electrical grid itself .\nToday , Internet-of-Things devices require individual connections to a home network .\nThat \u2019 s part of what makes them hard to manage , not to mention unsecure .\nBut it also allows so-called \u201c smart @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ones ; the user can always opt out of the wireless features of a kettle or a refrigerator and just brew tea or chill food like usual .\nBut once a load disaggregation hub of Sense \u2019 s ilk is installed , basic identification , usage , and data reporting could eventually be accomplished via the electric line itself , and without the consumer even knowing .\nI asked my Georgia Tech colleague Justin Romberg , a professor of electrical and computer engineering and an expert in digital signal processing to weigh in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blender or a razor wanted to cooperate with a power meter , he explains , it could do so easily by sending a predetermined electrical pulse on the line to signal power cycles or even secondary information about what it \u2019 s doing .\nIt \u2019 s hypothetical and would take years to roll out , but if standardized and installed in newly manufactured appliances , the result could be made compatible with a local hub like Sense or , via the electrical main , a remote one elsewhere on the grid from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in secret about how its owner uses it .\nSo much for \u201c nonintrusive \u201d load monitoring .\nTo their credit , Sense \u2019 s leadership team is attentive to the privacy concerns their service presents .\nPhillips admits that gaining and maintaining consumer trust is essential to his product \u2019 s success , but he also hopes he \u2019 s on the right side of that trust from the outset .\nThe company \u2019 s privacy policy prohibits the sale of user data without opt-in permission , and also includes a promise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ s data upon request .\nSense does retain the right to use anonymized data in order to improve its machine-learning algorithms .\nOf course , technology companies change their policies all the time , and as a venture-backed company in today \u2019 s technology marketplace , success likely means acquisition .\nOn this front , Sense \u2019 s financial structure might distance the company from the data-greediness of traditional technology startups .\nIn September , Sense Labs closed a $ 14 million Series A , led by two energy-sector venture firms focused on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nOne is Royal Dutch Shell \u2019 s venture arm , and the other , Energy Impact Partners , is an investment fund capitalized entirely by utility companies .\nSmart utility meters , which automate billing and help power companies better match supply to demand , have increased consumer suspicion of the monopoly utilities that serve them .\nEnergy Impact Partners \u2019 s managing director , Lindsay Luger , tells me that her fund \u2019 s investors want better ways to engage with customers .\nHomeowners may not care much about their utility @ @ @ @ @ @ @ homes a lot ; for most Americans , a home is their most valuable asset .\nA product like Sense might allow energy businesses to give people new insights into sustainability , monitoring , and automation in their homes .\nMany utilities are already attempting to facilitate this by subsidizing Nest thermostats , and Sense monitors might soon follow suit .\nOf course , that might also entail data collection and aggregation .\nLuger echoes Phillips \u2019 s concerns about data ownership , but also notes that people are getting increasingly comfortable sharing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ results are beneficial .\nAll of which might be fine if Sense could and would secure and isolate that data from other uses in the long run .\nBut as a startup , the company must eventually contend with its status as a business expressly built to become a financial instrument .\nOn that front , Sense has an advantage that both impresses and terrifies .\nMost supposedly \u201c smart \u201d devices are really dumb and stupid .\nDumb because they facilitate an Internet of Things You Don \u2019 t Really Need\u2014connecting gadgets @ @ @ @ @ @ @ worked perfectly well already .\nJust ask the guy who spent 11 hours trying to make tea with a Wi-Fi kettle .\nAnd stupid because , despite having microprocessors that can do general-purpose computing , these devices mostly act like fancy buttons and data relays .\nFactor in the security woes of smart devices , and the Internet of Things looks foolish , too .\nWorse , the alternative to idiotic smarts in devices might not be intelligence , but shrewdness .\nNo matter how earnest and well-intentioned businesspeople like Mike Phillips and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ intentions can \u2019 t close the Pandora \u2019 s box a service like Sense opens .\nMore than ever , a product \u2019 s social and ethical implications must be evaluated in relation to the possible consequences of its likely future use .\nLuger says that her firm doesn \u2019 t go into investments with specific exit strategies in mind .\n\u201c Build a great company , and an exit will find you , \u201d she tells me .\nShe points out that lots of industries might find Sense \u2019 s business an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ firm \u2019 s capital base , offer an obvious acquisition target .\nBut she admits that Google and Amazon are possible suitors as well , along with insurance and manufacturing companies that might be interested in real-time data from their appliances .\nWhich suggests that any future of widespread , residential load disaggregation is likely also a future of constant scrutiny .\nIf that future becomes too dystopian , owners could always hire an electrician to remove the Sense device from their panels .\nBut things are never so simple , particularly when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it to search the web without Google , after all , or to connect with friends without Facebook , or to network without LinkedIn ?\nConsumers have already proven willing to hand over personal data for cash or discounts .\nInsurance is following suit .\nSoon , drivers might not be able to get auto insurance without connecting a networked device to their vehicles \u2019 on-board diagnostics port .\nOr health insurance without a fitness tracker .\nOr a loan without a full-access social media disclosure .\nOr , perhaps , utility service @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to that the uncertainty about how technology companies and the government will cooperate under a Donald Trump presidency , and all of that information about what ordinary people do starts to look less like a fair exchange for free services , and more like an unplanned entry into a society of total surveillance .\nIt may seem quibbling to bring up such matters in the context of a $ 250 energy monitor that few will buy initially , run by apparently well-meaning folks with innocuous intentions .\nBut it always seems that way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nThe terror of a truly smart gadget like Sense is the same as its promise : that it really is the future , and furthermore that its arrival is inevitable .\nThat \u2019 s something to think about when plugging in or turning on an appliance .\nEventually , soon even , the tiny electrical load it draws will reach past the blender or the light bulb , out above the house and up into the cloud , where it will replicate onto the ledgers of federal agents and commercial advertisers and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Become an Activist Post Patron for $ 1 per month at Patreon .\nSo , not really a glowing

executives and lobbyists have received training by at least one organization to benefit at customers \u2019 expense : Edison Electric Institute ( EEI ) .\nEEI used anti-clean energy campaigns as role models in political boot camp for utility execs EEI \u2019 s boot camp held up two companies as case studies \u2013 FirstEnergy and APS \u2013 despite both having become paragons @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for investor-owned electric utilities ran a training camp last December to teach lobbyists and executives from the nation \u2019 s utilities how to run winning political campaigns , using as case studies some of the most controversial efforts by utilities to defeat clean energy policies in recent years .\nThe Edison Electric Institute ( EEI ) hosted its week-long \u201c Campaign Institute , \u201d at Georgetown University \u2019 s business school in December 2019 , billing the event as a \u201c partnership with Georgetown University.\n\u201d Dozens of high-ranking government affairs and communications @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like Alliant Energy , ConEdison , Dominion Energy , Duke Energy , DTE Energy , Entergy , Evergy , NationalGrid , NextEra Energy , PG & E , PNM , PPL , Xcel and their subsidiaries .\nMaterials from the week-long event obtained by the Energy and Policy Institute give the impression of an industry that perceives itself to be under siege from activists who are seeking a host of policy changes , many of them intended to force utilities to decarbonize in order to address climate change .\n\u201c At Edison Electric @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more that we have issues that are being litigated not only in state legislatures , public utility commissions , but also at the ballot box with ballot initiatives , \u201d EEI Executive Vice President of Public Policy and External Affairs Brian Wolff in a video from EEI promoting the Institute .\nWe really want to educate and campaign-ready our companies and our executives and that \u2019 s what we \u2019 re doing at the Campaign Institute , \u201d Wolff continued .\nEEI warned of emerging policy threats , many motivated by climate In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Industry Issues , \u201d EEI \u2019 s Executive Director of External Affairs Brad Viator divided the \u201c major categories of risk \u201d facing utilities into three areas : Climate , Infrastructure Projects , and Business Model Changes .\nViator \u2019 s presentation named more specific risks within each category , including : Climate : \u201c gas constraints along the coasts , \u201d including proposals to ban gas use in buildings in New York and Seattle ; climate action by Congress after the election .\nInfrastructure : \u201c pipelines are increasingly difficult to build @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and earn high profits from them .\nBusiness Model : \u201c restructuring proposals : NV , AZ , FL , VA ?\n\u201d ; campaigns to bring investor-owned utilities under municipal control in \u201c Pueblo [ CO ] , California , Maine , New York , Chicago \u201d ; \u201c community choice aggregation \u201d ; \u201c pressure to create wholesale markets \u2013 CO and the Carolinas.\n\u201d Viator also named solar net metering and renewable energy portfolio standards as ongoing challenges .\nAdvocates are pursuing most of the policies that Viator named as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from fossil fuels to clean energy by utilities , which are not voluntarily decarbonizing at rates necessary to stave off the worst impacts of climate change .\nViator referenced \u201c pressure to create wholesale markets \u201d in the Carolinas , for instance .\nAnalysts released a report this week noting how a regional transmission operator in the Southeast could reduce carbon emissions by 37 percent .\nUtilities in the Southeast oppose the idea , and a dark-money group that appears aligned with the industry has been running ads against it .\nFirstEnergy campaign @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as case study The Campaign Institute \u2019 s curriculum featured three case studies from utility companies .\nTwo of those focused on highly controversial efforts by utilities to overturn or prevent clean energy-supportive policies .\nOne case study , from FirstEnergy , boasted of the company \u2019 s work to pass HB 6 in Ohio and to defend the legislation from a repeal ballot initiative .\nHB 6 bailed out FirstEnergy \u2019 s coal and nuclear plants and ended Ohio \u2019 s clean energy and energy efficiency standards .\nThat effort by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ month , when federal corruption charges stemming from HB 6 \u2019 s passage sent FirstEnergy \u2019 s stock cratering and the company into turmoil , with customers and investors lining up to file class-action suits against the utility .\nProsecutors have not charged FirstEnergy or its executives in the criminal case at this time .\nFirstEnergy \u2019 s VP for State and Local Government Affairs and Economic Development , Joel Bailey , presented on the HB 6 campaign along with Holland Consulting Services \u2019 Ken Holland .\nThe presentation described the broad history @ @ @ @ @ @ @ including earlier failed efforts by FirstEnergy to secure bailouts from Ohio and from the Trump administration .\nThe slides did not reference the payment by FirstEnergy and its subsidiaries of over $ 60 million to a 501 ( c ) ( 4 ) dark money group that formed the slush fund at the root of the federal bribery charges , but they did include a snapshot of the Ohioans for Energy Security website with the identifying domain name .\nOhioans for Energy Security is the \u201c front company \u201d described by federal investigators @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Enterprise at the heart of the alleged racketeering ring fueled by FirstEnergy \u2019 s money .\nBailey and Holland \u2019 s slides did note that \u201c HB 6 Supporters also employed \u2018 blockers \u2019 to mirror signature gatherers and provide counter messages \u201d in an attempt to thwart an effort by environmentalists to repeal the law .\n\u201c This was the first time blockers were used in Ohio election process , \u201d the slide continued .\n\u201c This gained considerable negative media attention [ and ] Allegations of illegal activity and intimidation.\n\u201d @ @ @ @ @ @ @ settings about heaping praise on FirstEnergy for its now highly scandalous political work in Ohio .\nEEI gave its \u201c Edwin D. Hill \u201d award , which it presents to \u201c leaders who advance issues at the state and local levels \u201d to FirstEnergy and some of the union chapters that worked with it for their efforts to secure passage of HB 6 .\n\u201c Winning the Ed Hill Award is the World Series in public policy \u2013 there \u2019 s no greater honor to be honest with you , \u201d FirstEnergy SVP @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a video about the award .\nThe criminal charges filed in Ohio suggest that the indicted former House Speaker Householder spoke with Dowling 14 times by phone as he worked to pass HB 6 .\n\u201c [ FirstEnergy CEO ] Chuck Jones put together a tremendous coalition to get the job done , including labor , \u201d EEI President Tom Kuhn said in the same video .\n\u201c But he is such a fantastic leader for our industry .\nHe cares , he cares about the industry , he cares about the customer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and his employees , so much .\nAnd when he has an issue like this to deal with , he throws himself totally into it .\nHe passionately believes it , and that was a major driver to make this thing happen.\n\u201d Another case study at the Georgetown meeting , from Arizona Public Service , boasted of how that company defeated a 2018 ballot initiative that would have required utilities in Arizona to produce half of their electricity from clean sources by 2030 .\nAPS spent nearly $ 40 million to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ opposition to the measure , along with unpopular rate hikes and controversial spending to influence the election of its regulators in 2014 and 2016 , led to APS \u2019 growing political toxicity in Arizona .\nWithin 18 months of the ballot initiative , APS \u2019 s CEO had resigned amid controversy , and the company had committed to almost the exact same clean energy pathway the ballot initiative , Prop 127 , would have required of it .\nBased on notes in a powerpoint presentation , participants at the Georgetown meeting would have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ex-CEO Don Brandt and from Vice President of External Affairs Jessica Pacheco on how the company was able to defeat the initiative .\nIt \u2019 s not clear if Brandt attended the meeting , or dialed into it .\nHis speaker notes indicated that he targeted Tom Steyer and former commissioner Kris Mayes .\n\u201c Here you see former Arizona Corporation Commission chairman Kris Mayes with Tom Steyer , who has provided funding for her aggressively anti-utility agenda .\nIn attempting to change the state \u2019 s constitution , Mayes built a close @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it from Steyer ) because few in state will do business with her , \u201d Brandt said , according to the notes .\nBrandt \u2019 s notes also attacked the media as biased against his industry .\n\u201c Even if you have a good working relationship with your local media , they are not your friend .\nThey need a villain \u2014 and too often it is us .\nThe standard approach is anti-corporation .\nWe can navigate through it if we understand it.\n\u201d Brandt also planned to say , per his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you to engage with your partners at the national and local levels and with industry associations \u2014 NEI , EEI , NAM , chambers of commerce to name a few .\nEngage them and coordinate efforts .\nMake sure they are up to speed and understand what is happening on the ground .\nTom Kuhn and his staff at EEI were with us each step of the way , and their efforts were much appreciated.\n\u201d \u201c There is nobody who sees your message who should not understand it , \u201d Pacheco said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u201c What is Prop 127 going to do ?\nIt is going to raise your bills.\n\u201d The message that Prop 127 would raise customers bills was indeed the utility \u2019 s message throughout 2018 , but by the time of Pacheco \u2019 s presentation at Georgetown in late 2019 , the company \u2019 s new leadership appeared to be singing a different tune .\nA month later in January , APS \u2019 new CEO Jeff Guldner committed the company to voluntarily meet a nearly identical goal to what Prop 127 would have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 2030 .\nIn that announcement , APS said that it would transition to clean energy \u201c while maintaining affordable , reliable service for our customers.\n\u201d Pacheco was the key architect behind APS \u2019 spending via dark-money groups to influence the election of its regulators on the Arizona Corporation Commission in 2014 , beginning a period during which APS \u2019 political reputation grew increasingly toxic ; shareholder analysts have increasingly called that toxicity a major risk to the company .\nBrandt left APS in November 2019 .\nPacheco will leave APS in early @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an email Guldner sent last week .\nThe third utility presentation was from NV Energy , which described its successful defeat of a ballot initiative that would have restructured Nevada \u2019 s energy market , breaking the company \u2019 s monopoly over retail electricity sales .\nEEI \u2019 s posture appears out of step with ESG investor concerns EEI \u2019 s highlighting of the Ohio and Arizona case studies indicates that while it aggressively works to rebrand the utility sector as clean , the trade association was , as of December , continuing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clean energy policies , and to at least look the other way on dark-money efforts by utilities to win political victories .\nThose stances are increasingly out of step with the demands of large segments of \u201c ESG \u201d investors \u2013 those interested in environment , social and governance \u2013 as well as some mainstream investors In the wake of the FirstEnergy HB 6 scandal , analysts from Bank of America wrote notes examining which other utilities may be exposed to risks of dark-money spending of the type that FirstEnergy pursued and which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dark-money spending and other astroturf campaigns have been common in the utility sector in recent years .\nA Norwegian asset manager just divested from Southern Company over that utility \u2019 s anti-climate political advocacy , echoing previous calls by other large asset managers for utilities to align their political advocacy with the Paris Agreement .\nIn addition to hearing the case studies , the utility executives received presentations from outside consultants , PR firms like Adfero and Georgetown faculty , who gave presentations with titles like \u201c Communicating with Special Interests \u201d and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a Campaign.\n\u201d \u201c Avoid pay for play ; Real partnerships/relationships \u201d read one slide in a presentation from Mary Cheney of New Troy Strategies .\nAnother presentation from an election lawyer at Ballard Spahr offered utilities guidance on how to avoid violating laws when spending on elections ; much of the guidance runs contrary to the case studies presented by FirstEnergy and APS .\n\u201c The best advocacy campaign can quickly derail into a legal and public relations nightmare if you don \u2019 t comply with the law , \u201d a description @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into the scandal that would burst into the open a few months later in Ohio .\nIn the actual presentation , the lawyer advised : \u201c Do not be the sole or dominant funder of an organization ( if you want it to be viewed as \u201c independent \u201d ) , \u201d as APS has been for ballot initiatives and independent expenditures in Arizona elections for years .\nA presentation from communications consultant Michael Maslansky , who for years has offered guidance to EEI on how utilities can brand themselves as greener to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ve lost the benefit of the doubt \u201d and that \u201c they challenge your motives \u201d in a slide showing pictures of utility foundations offering checks to charities .\nUtilities often use their charities tactically to support their political agenda .\n\u201c What \u2019 s the message to protect the role of natural gas ?\n\u201d Maslansky asks the executives to consider in another slide .\nEEI \u2019 s operating budget is funded by dues paid by the utilities , which in turn recover those costs from ratepayers .\nThat means that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and its partnership with Georgetown University would likely have been paid out of utility customers \u2019 electric bills .\nGeorgetown University announced in February of this year that it plans to divest from public securities of fossil fuel companies within the next five years .\nMany Americans still don \u2019 t realize that utility companies have also benefited at customers \u2019 expense with \u201c Smart \u201d Grids and \u201c Smart \u201d Meters \u2013 electric , gas , and water .\nThese meters DO NOT save meaningful amounts of energy and customer bills usually @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u201c Smart \u201d Meters collect customer usage data 24/7 , whereas original 1-way transmitting analog meters DO NOT .\nUtilities collect and analyze customer usage data so they can market more products and services to customers and/or sell data to 3rd parties .\nThis is sometimes referred to as \u201c Surveillance Capitalism.\n\u201d \u201c Smart \u201d Meters have been a disaster from the start \u2013 hence the documentary produced about them .\nIn addition to higher customer bills , they have been associated with fires , explosions , frequent replacement , unwanted surveillance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cybersecurity risks , and more ( see 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 ) .\nMillions of electric , gas , and water \u201c Smart \u201d Meters have already been installed by American utility companies \u2013

a US Gulag", "content": "Court hearings in Britain over the US administration \u2019 s extradition case against Julian Assange begin in earnest next week .\nThe decade-long saga that brought us to this point should appall anyone who cares about our increasingly fragile freedoms .\nA journalist and publisher has been deprived of his liberty for 10 years .\nAccording to UN experts , he has been arbitrarily detained and tortured for much of that time through intense physical confinement and endless psychological pressure .\nHe has been bugged and spied on by the CIA during his time in political asylum , in Ecuador @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that violated his most fundamental legal rights .\nThe judge overseeing his hearings has a serious conflict of interest \u2013 with her family embedded in the UK security services \u2013 that she did not declare and which should have required her to recuse herself from the case .\nAll indicators are that Assange will be extradited to the US to face a rigged grand jury trial meant to ensure he sees out his days in a maximum-security prison , serving a sentence of up to 175 years .\nNone of this happened in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ happened right under our noses , in a major Western capital , and in a state that claims to protect the rights of a free press .\nIt happened not in the blink of an eye but in slow motion \u2013 day after day , week after week , month after month , year after year .\nAnd once we strip out a sophisticated campaign of character assassination against Assange by Western governments and a compliant media , the sole justification for this relentless attack on press freedom is that a 49-year-old man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ That is the reason \u2013 and the only reason \u2013 that the US is seeking his extradition and why he has been languishing in what amounts to solitary confinement in Belmarsh high-security prison during the Covid-19 pandemic .\nHis lawyers \u2019 appeals for bail have been refused .\nBecome an Activist Post Patron for $ 1 per month at Patreon .\nWhile the press corps abandoned Assange a decade ago , echoing official talking points that pilloried him over toilet hygiene and his treatment of his cat , Assange is today exactly where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Western governments got their way .\nWhat awaits him is rendition to the US so he can be locked out of sight for the rest of his life .\nThere were two goals the US and UK set out to achieve through the visible persecution , confinement and torture of Assange .\nFirst , he and WikiLeaks , the transparency organization he co-founded , needed to be disabled .\nEngaging with WikiLeaks had to be made too risky to contemplate for potential whistleblowers .\nThat is why Chelsea Manning \u2013 the US soldier @ @ @ @ @ @ @ war crimes in Iraq and Afghanistan for which Assange now faces extradition \u2013 was similarly subjected to harsh imprisonment .\nShe later faced punitive daily fines while in jail to pressure her into testifying against Assange .\nThe aim has been to discredit WikiLeaks and similar organizations and stop them from being able to publish more revelatory documents \u2013 of the kind that show Western governments are not the \u201c good guys \u201d managing world affairs for the benefit of mankind , but are in fact highly militarized , global bullies advancing the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ destruction and pillage they always pursued .\nAnd second , Assange had to be made to suffer horribly and in public \u2013 to be made an example of \u2013 to deter other journalists from ever considering following in his footsteps .\nHe is the modern equivalent of a severed head on a pike displayed at the city gates .\nThe very obvious fact \u2013 confirmed by the media coverage of his case \u2013 is that this strategy , advanced chiefly by the US and UK ( with Sweden playing a lesser role ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ corporate media journalists are still enthusiastically colluding in the vilification of Assange \u2013 mainly at this stage by ignoring his awful plight .\nWhen he hurried into Ecuador \u2019 s embassy back in 2012 , seeking political asylum , journalists from every corporate media outlet ridiculed his claim \u2013 now , of course , fully vindicated \u2013 that he was evading US efforts to extradite him and lock him away for good .\nThe media continued with their mockery even as evidence mounted that a grand jury had been secretly convened to draw @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was located in the eastern district of Virginia , where the major US security and intelligence services are headquartered .\nAny jury there is dominated by US security personnel and their families .\nHis hope of a fair trial was nonexistent .\nInstead we have endured eight years of misdirection by the corporate media and its willing complicity in his character assassination , which has laid the ground for the current public indifference to Assange \u2019 s extradition and widespread ignorance of its horrendous implications .\nCorporate journalists have accepted , entirely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rationalizations for why the interests of justice have been served by locking Assange away indefinitely \u2013 even before his extradition \u2013 and trampling his most basic legal rights .\nThe other side of the story \u2013 Assange \u2019 s , the story hiding in plain sight \u2013 has invariably been missing from the coverage , whether it has been CNN , the New York Times , the BBC or the Guardian .\nFirst , it was claimed that Assange had fled questioning over sexual assault allegations in Sweden , even though it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leave ; even though the original Swedish prosecutor , Eva Finne , dismissed the investigation against him , saying \u201c There is no suspicion of any crime whatsoever \u201d , before it was picked up by a different prosecutor for barely concealed , politicized reasons ; and even though Assange later invited Swedish prosecutors to question him where he was ( in the embassy ) , an option they regularly agreed to in other cases but resolutely refused in his .\nIt was not just that none of these points was ever provided @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the corporate media .\nOr that much else in Assange \u2019 s favor was simply ignored , such as tampered evidence in the case of one of the two women who alleged sexual assault and the refusal of the other to sign the rape statement drawn up for her by police .\nThe story was also grossly and continuously misreported as relating to \u201c rape charges \u201d when Assange was wanted simply for questioning .\nNo charges were ever laid against him because the second Swedish prosecutor , Marianne Ny \u2013 and her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , then head of the prosecution service and now leader of the Labour party \u2013 seemingly wished to avoid testing the credibility of their allegations by actually questioning Assange .\nLeaving him to rot in a small room in the embassy served their purposes much better .\nWhen the Sweden case fizzled out \u2013 when it became clear that the original prosecutor had been right to conclude that there was no evidence to justify further questioning , let alone charges \u2013 the political and media class shifted tack .\nSuddenly Assange \u2019 s @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , political reasons \u2013 because he had supposedly aided Donald Trump \u2019 s presidential election campaign in 2016 by publishing emails , allegedly \u201c hacked \u201d by Russia , from the Democratic party \u2019 s servers .\nThe content of those emails , obscured in the coverage at the time and largely forgotten now , revealed corruption by Hillary Clinton \u2019 s camp and efforts to sabotage the party \u2019 s primaries to undermine her rival for the presidential nomination , Bernie Sanders .\nThose on the authoritarian right have shown little concern @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the embassy , and later jailing in Belmarsh , for his exposure of US war crimes , which is why little effort has been expended on winning them over .\nThe demonization campaign against Assange has focused instead on issues that are likely to trigger liberals and the left , who might otherwise have qualms about jettisoning the First Amendment and locking people up for doing journalism .\nJust as the Swedish allegations , despite their non-investigation , tapped into the worst kind of kneejerk identity politics on the left , the \u201c @ @ @ @ @ @ @ alienate the Democratic party base .\nExtraordinarily , the claim of Russian hacking persists even though years later \u2013 and after a major \u201c Russiagate \u201d inquiry by Robert Mueller \u2013 it still can not be stood up with any actual evidence .\nIn fact , some of those closest to the matter , such as former UK ambassador Craig Murray , have insisted all along that the emails were not hacked by Russia but were leaked by a disenchanted Democratic party insider .\nAn even more important point , however , is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no choice , after it was handed those documents , but to expose abuses by the Democratic party \u2013 whoever was the source .\nThe reason that Assange and WikiLeaks became entwined in the Russiagate fiasco \u2013 which wasted the energies of Democratic party supporters on a campaign against Trump that actually strengthened rather than weakened him \u2013 was because of the credulous coverage , once again , of the issue by almost the entire corporate media .\nLiberal outlets like the Guardian newspaper even went so far as to openly fabricate a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that a Trump aide , Paul Manafort , and unnamed \u201c Russians \u201d secretly visited Assange in the embassy \u2013 without repercussion or retraction .\nAll of this made possible what has happened since .\nAfter the Swedish case evaporated and there were no reasonable grounds left for not letting Assange walk free from the embassy , the media suddenly decided in chorus that a technical bail violation was grounds enough for his continuing confinement in the embassy \u2013 or , better still , his arrest and jailing .\nThat breach of bail @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u2019 s decision to seek asylum in the embassy , based on a correct assessment that the US planned to demand his extradition and imprisonment .\nNone of these well-paid journalists seemed to remember that , in British law , failure to meet bail conditions is permitted if there is \u201c reasonable cause \u201d \u2013 and fleeing political persecution is very obviously just such a reasonable cause .\nSimilarly , the media willfully ignored the conclusions of a report by Nils Melzer , a Swiss scholar of international law and the United Nations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ UK , US and Sweden had not only denied Assange his basic legal rights but had colluded in subjecting him to years of psychological torture \u2013 a form of torture , Melzer has pointed out , that was refined by the Nazis because it was found to be crueler and more effective at breaking victims than physical torture .\nAssange has been blighted by deteriorating health and cognitive decline as a result , and has lost significant weight .\nNone of that has been deemed worthy by the corporate media of more than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u2019 s poor health made him incapable of attending a court hearing .\nInstead Melzer \u2019 s repeated warnings about the abusive treatment of Assange and its effects on him have fallen on deaf ears .\nThe media has simply ignored Melzer \u2019 s findings , as though they were never published , that Assange has been , and is being , tortured .\nWe need only pause and imagine how much coverage Melzer \u2019 s report would have received had it concerned the treatment of a dissident in an official enemy state @ @ @ @ @ @ @ British police , in coordination with an Ecuador now led by a president , Lenin Moreno , who craved closer ties with Washington , stormed the embassy to drag Assange out and lock him up in Belmarsh prison .\nIn their coverage of these events , journalists again played dumb .\nThey had spent years first professing the need to \u201c believe women \u201d in the Assange case , even if it meant ignoring evidence , and then proclaiming the sanctity of bail conditions , even if they were used simply as a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was all swept aside in an instant .\nSuddenly Assange \u2019 s nine years of confinement over a nonexistent sexual assault investigation and a minor bail infraction were narratively replaced by an espionage case .\nAnd the media lined up against him once again .\nA decade ago the idea that Assange could be extradited to the US and locked up for the rest of his life , his journalism recast as \u201c espionage \u201d , was mocked as so improbable , so outrageously unlawful that no \u201c mainstream \u201d journalist was prepared @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for his seeking asylum in the embassy .\nIt was derided as a figment of the fevered , paranoid imaginations of Assange and his supporters , and as a self-serving cover for him to avoid facing the investigation in Sweden .\nBut when British police invaded the embassy in April last year and arrested him for extradition to the US on precisely the espionage charges Assange had always warned were going to be used against him , journalists reported these developments as though they were oblivious to this backstory .\nThe media erased @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have made them look like willing dupes of US propaganda , like apologists for US exceptionalism , and because it would have proved Assange right once more .\nIt would have demonstrated that he is the real journalist , in contrast to their pacified , complacent , power-worshiping corporate journalism .\nRight now every journalist in the world ought to be up in arms , protesting at the abuses Assange is suffering , and has suffered , and the fate he will endure if extradition is approved .\nThey should be protesting on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the endless and blatant abuses of legal process at Assange \u2019 s hearings in the British courts , including the gross conflict of interest of Lady Emma Arbuthnot , the judge presiding over his case .\nThey should be in uproar at the surveillance the CIA illegally arranged inside the Ecuadorian embassy while Assange was confined there , nullifying the already dishonest US case against him by violating his client-lawyer privilege .\nThey should be expressing outrage at Washington \u2019 s maneuvers , accorded a thin veneer of due process by the British @ @ @ @ @ @ @ espionage charges for doing work that lies at the very heart of what journalism claims to be \u2013 holding the powerful to account .\nJournalists do not need to care about Assange or like him .\nThey have to speak out in protest because approval of his extradition will mark the official death of journalism .\nIt will mean that any journalist in the world who unearths embarrassing truths about the US , who discovers its darkest secrets , will need to keep quiet or risk being jailed for the rest of their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ journalist .\nBut it has had no such effect .\nThe vast majority of Western journalists , of course , never uncover one significant secret from the centers of power in their entire professional careers \u2013 even those ostensibly monitoring those power centers .\nThese journalists repackage press releases and lobby briefings , they tap sources inside government who use them as a conduit to the large audiences they command , and they relay gossip and sniping from inside the corridors of power .\nThat is the reality of access journalism that constitutes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ political news .\nNonetheless , Assange \u2019 s abandonment by journalists \u2013 the complete lack of solidarity as one of their number is persecuted as flagrantly as dissidents once sent to the gulags \u2013 should depress us .\nIt means not only that journalists have abandoned any pretense that they do real journalism , but that they have also renounced the aspiration that it be done by anyone at all .\nIt means that corporate journalists are ready to be viewed with even greater disdain by their audiences than is already the case @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , they have sided with governments to ensure that anyone who truly holds power to account , like Assange , will end up behind bars .\nTheir own freedom brands them as a captured elite \u2013 irrefutable evidence that they serve power , they do not confront it .\nThe only conclusion to be drawn is that corporate journalists care less about the truth than they do about their careers , their salaries , their status , and their access to the rich and powerful .\nAs Ed Herman and Noam Chomsky explained @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , journalists join a media class after lengthy education and training processes designed to weed out those not reliably in sympathy with the ideological interests of their corporate employers .\nBriefly , Assange raised the stakes for all journalists by renouncing their god \u2013 \u201c access \u201d \u2013 and their modus operandi of revealing occasional glimpses of very partial truths offered up by \u201c friendly \u201d , and invariably anonymous , sources who use the media to settle scores with rivals in the centers of power .\nInstead , through whistleblowers , Assange @ @ @ @ @ @ @ full-spectrum truth whose exposure helped no one in power \u2013 only us , the public , as we tried to understand what was being done , and had been done , in our names .\nFor the first time , we could see just how ugly , and often criminal , the behavior of our leaders was .\nAssange did not just expose the political class , he exposed the media class too \u2013 for their feebleness , for their hypocrisy , for their dependence on the centers of power , for their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which they were embedded .\nFew of them can forgive Assange that crime .\nWhich is why they will be there cheering on his extradition , if only through their silence .\nA few liberal writers will wait till it is too late for Assange , till he has been packaged up for rendition , to voice halfhearted , mealy-mouthed or agonized columns arguing that , unpleasant as Assange supposedly is , he did not deserve the treatment the US has in store for him .\nBut that will be far too little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ solidarity from journalists and their media organizations long ago , as well as full-throated denunciations of his oppressors .\nHe and WikiLeaks were on the front line of a war to remake journalism , to rebuild it as a true check on the runaway power of our governments .\nJournalists had a chance to join him in that struggle .\nInstead they fled the battlefield , leaving him as a sacrificial offering to their corporate masters .\nJonathan Cook won the Martha Gellhorn Special Prize for Journalism .\nHis latest books are

.\nUber and Lyft opt out of the employer-funded healthcare system at a time when our society can \u2019 t agree on how to replace the employer-funded health care system .\nTheir drivers currently rely on ACA-based marketplaces , which the current Congress has pledged to eradicate .\nI @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I \u2019 ve spoken to who have described long , hard days of work at $ 9-12 an hour after expenses .\n( \u201c After expenses \u201d is key here . )\nThat matches independent analyses of Uber drivers profiting about $ 24,000 after expenses , which doesn \u2019 t pay the rent in high-property-value

low-priced Roku boxes and Chromebooks don \u2019 t help if the jobs available to many people pay so poorly that they can \u2019 t afford the basic needs of food , housing , healthcare , and education

fewer jobs than that , but there will be jobs .\nWhat \u2019 s the tech industry doing to make sure that soon-to-be-former taxi @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do those jobs when they don \u2019 t have the time or

industries , like healthcare .\nStep away from the gender politics here and you see that there \u2019 s a certain class of men who really won \u2019 t like it when there are no culturally dignified , mostly physical jobs on offer .\nBefore you cast them off , remember that they vote @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u2019 re seeing one outcome of those angry voters right now .\nFor about a decade , the tech industry has leaned on skilled immigration to make up for the US not producing the skills the industry needs .\nThat \u2019 s about to get cut off by those angry voters , who are saying , \u201c if we don \u2019 t get jobs , no one does.\n\u201d Unfortunately , their rage isn \u2019 t quite coherent enough to demand not just jobs , but skills .\nBut I \u2019 ll be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ world up to the fact

.\nThat \u2019 s not cool .\nTech is creating these problems ; tech needs to make a good-faith effort to solve them .\nIf we reach a new jobs equilibrium in an autonomous , 5G world , will it be well below full employment ?\nOr will the jobs available primarily be so low wage that they can \u2019 t pay for basic living expenses ?\nIn that case , the basic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ job for a wage to survive\u2014becomes broken .\nThen the tech industry may need to push radical solutions like universal basic income , so Americans don \u2019 t starve when most of the jobs are done by robots .\nWhat kind of culture will 5G create , under-employed and over-connected ?\nWill it be like the dystopias of Ernest Cline \u2019 s Ready Player One and William Gibson \u2019 s The Peripheral , where we

Assange \u2019 s extradition hearing is set to start on Monday September 7 at the Old Bailey , the Central Criminal Court of London and could last three or four weeks .\nAssange has been indicted on 17 charges of espionage and one charge of conspiring with a source to violate the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act for his reporting on the US wars in Iraq and Afghanistan and the torture at Guantanamo Bay .\nThese charges against Assange are a part of a war on journalism .\nThis is the first time that the Espionage Act @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a journalist , in this case an Australian citizen publishing material from outside of the US .\nThe gruesome attack on the First Amendment became naked during the February phase of the UK hearing of the US request for Assange \u2019 s extradition .\nOn the first day of what unfolded as a grotesque show trial , Assange was subjected to strip searches twice , handcuffed 11 times , and his legal material was confiscated by prison officers .\nIn the courtroom he was held behind a glass pane in the presence of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lawyers , contrary to the accepted international standard .\nThe prosecution of Assange has always been politically motivated .\nNils Meltzer , the UN Special Rapporteur on Torture , recognized the coordinated abuse of power by Western governments involved in this case .\nAfter visiting Assange in prison with his medical team in May 2019 , he reported that the WikiLeaks founder showed clear symptoms of prolonged psychological torture .\nFrom his house arrest and arbitrary detention inside the Ecuadorian Embassy in London to his incarceration in Belmarsh Prison , Assange has been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the state and his basic rights have been severely violated .\nFor years , while he was inside the embassy , Assange was deprived of medical care , denied access to fresh air and sunlight by the UK government \u2019 s refusal to honor his right of asylum \u2013 in violation of the rulings of the UN Working Group on Arbitrary Detention .\nHis activities were under constant surveillance by a Spanish security contractor , secretly working on behalf of the CIA .\nEvidence from Assange \u2019 s own extradition case even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nFrom several serious conflicts of interest related to the judge overseeing his case to a documented destruction of evidence by the prosecuting agency , combined with Assange \u2019 s prolonged lack of access to his lawyers , his case has involved a significant level of abuse of process .\nAs this latest episode of \u201c journalism on trial \u201d approaches , the political nature of the case becomes more apparent .\nOn June 24 , 2020 , halfway into Assange \u2019 s extradition case , the US prosecutors introduced a second superseding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ extradition request by expanding the scope of the charges ( without changing the charges themselves ) .\nAt the 27 July administrative hearing , Assange \u2019 s lawyers posited that this last minute change by the Trump administration was an attempt to postpone the hearing until the US presidential election is over , and that the US attorney general was thereby further manipulating this case for political ends .\nTo make matters worse , the UK court process has been rife with administrative chaos and mishandling of technical issues .\nReporters Without Borders @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remotely monitor administrative hearings in this case , but reports extreme difficulty due to constant barriers to access to the proceedings .\nJournalists have been left on hold so they could not listen to the teleconference at all , and even when they gained access the proceedings have often been inaudible .\nAt one point , even the lawyers were shut out of the teleconference system .\nAssange himself has complained of not being able to hear all of the proceedings .\nEven worse , on several occasions , the prison simply \u201c @ @ @ @ @ @ @ video call room in time for scheduled hearings .\nAssange \u2019 s US extradition case is a testimony to the deepening crisis of Western liberal democracy .\nWhat has been revealed is a widespread breakdown of systems of accountability and a dangerous trend toward authoritarianism .\nThe sources behind WikiLeaks publications have often sacrificed their freedom ( and potentially their lives ) to alert the public to these precise issues .\nThe former US Army intelligence analyst Chelsea Manning released classified US military video depicting the Apache helicopter gunship killing innocent civilians in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Collateral Murder video , along with release of the Afghan War Diaries and the Iraq War Log became a major catharsis for many Americans , causing them to begin questioning the legitimacy of war and the actions of their own government .\nTheir release of documents from Strategic Forecasting ( Stratfor ) , the private Texas-based global intelligence company ( allegedly provided to WikiLeaks by computer programmer and political activist Jeremy Hammond ) exposed the inner workings of the pervasive surveillance state , in part perpetrated by contracting agencies .\nThe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over five million emails from Stratfor \u2013 revealed the company \u2019 s spying activities on human rights activists around the globe .\nEmails included discussions on Assange \u2019 s arrest , and a plot to go after \u201c every person linked to Wiki [ Leaks ] \u201d .\nDisclosure of confidential documents [ \u201c Vault 7 \u201c ] that came from the CIA \u2019 s top-secret security network ( allegedly released by the former CIA engineer Joshua Schulte ) exposed CIA cyber-weaponry , including their own version of NSA cyber-spying with an ability @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as well as Samsung TVs and even the electronic controls of cars .\nThe excessive power of the agency has been demonstrated via drone attacks , and their engagement in espionage during the French presidential election .\nThose young American whistleblowers acted courageously to expose the government \u2019 s secrets , believing that people have the right to know what governments and corporations are doing behind closed doors .\nThey were inside these institutions , who saw what they believed to be dangerous and unconstitutional activity , and wanted change .\nThey incurred @ @ @ @ @ @ @ faith in the ability of an informed public to hold the powerful to account .\nAt a pretrial hearing during her prosecution for releasing the largest leak of classified documents in history , Manning read out a personal statement describing the motivation behind her actions : At his sentencing hearing , Hammond also shared a similar conviction .\nHe spoke about how his act was inspired by his forerunner Chelsea Manning and her courage in exposing the atrocities committed by US forces in Iraq and Afghanistan : WikiLeaks , in dropping a bombshell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ indicated that the alleged source behind the publication of Vault 7 is said to have released the material in an effort to instigate a public debate about the CIA \u2019 s cyberweapons ( Joshua Schulte has been indicted \u2013 twice \u2013 in relation to the Vault 7 leaks ) .\nThrough their brave acts of whistleblowing , these admitted or alleged WikiLeaks sources performed the duty of citizens providing a check on abuses of power .\nInstead of just wishing and hoping for change , they actively strove to become that change .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ wrongdoing , they refused to remain silent and spoke out .\nThey reminded us of the vital role of an informed and engaged public in a functioning democracy .\nAssange , through his work with WikiLeaks provided means for his sources to defend the public \u2019 s right to know and to engage people in a democratic process of restoring justice .\nWikiLeaks , with numerous prestigious journalism awards , has shown how its unique model of \u201c scientific journalism \u201d \u2013 inspired by the conscience of ordinary people , and fueled by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a force powerful enough to challenge oppression , even from a superpower .\nFrom the 2007 release of the Kroll report on official corruption in Kenya which affected the outcome of the national election , to the exposing of the moral bankruptcy of Iceland \u2019 s largest bank in 2009 , WikiLeaks publications have sparked global revolutionary uprisings , and empowered people around the world .\nUS cable leaks shared through social networking sites in 2010 toppled the corrupt Tunisian dictator Ben Ali .\nThe US government reacted strongly to those waves of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out of conscience .\nFor providing evidence of US war crimes , Manning was put into a cage in Kuwait , the Quantico Marine Brig , and was detained way beyond the legal time limit in conditions that the United Nations Special Rapporteur on Torture said amounted to torture .\nShe was eventually sentenced to 35 years in prison , serving seven years before President Barack Obama commuted her sentence just before leaving office in 2017 .\nIn 2019 , Manning was once again sent back to jail for refusing to answer questions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ WikiLeaks 2010 disclosures .\nThe enormity of the government \u2019 s efforts to break her down pushed her to the point where she attempted to commit suicide while incarcerated .\nFor exposing the inner workings of the pervasive surveillance state , Hammond was charged with electronic infiltration and was sentenced to the maximum of 10 years .\nHe spent significant time in solitary confinement and his communication rights were restricted .\nIn 2019 , he was also called to serve on a grand jury investigating WikiLeaks publications .\nLike Manning , he too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and was found in contempt .\nHe remains in jail , quietly suffering .\nFollowing a partial mistrial ( he was acquitted on some counts ) , alleged CIA whistleblower Joshua Schulte was recently indicted again in his WikiLeaks-related case .\nHe is still held in custody in New York , silenced by a form of legal limbo .\nNow , with the prosecution of Assange , the US Empire tries to crush conscience once and for all , destroying the last vestiges of democracy .\nAssange has been held inside London @ @ @ @ @ @ @ days , alongside murderers and terrorists , for exposing the war crimes and human rights abuses of the US government ( and their allies ) .\nHe now faces the risk of extradition to the US , where he could receive no fair trial .\nIf convicted , Assange would be sentenced to up to 175 years in prison and be subjected to Special Administrative Measures ( SAMs ) , known to be the Darkest Corner of the U.S. federal prison system .\nThese harsh conditions not only gag a prisoner but also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into a complete isolation , cut off from the outside world .\nPossibly for a lifetime .\nRecognizing the dire threat to media freedom everywhere , Human Rights organizations like Amnesty International have come out strongly to oppose this political prosecution of Assange .\nJournalists around the world have come together in defense of Assange \u2019 s freedom .\nThey have criticized the US government \u2019 s dangerous move toward criminalizing basic journalistic activity .\nOver 200 doctors have spoken out against ongoing torture and medical neglect of the Australian journalist and called @ @ @ @ @ @ @ proceedings against Assange .\nAn array of lawyers and legal academics have expressed their concerns about the many violations of Assange \u2019 s fundamental human , civil and political rights , demanding his immediate release .\nAs the extradition proceedings resume this month , the mockery of justice will continue .\nIn this final moment before the light of transparency goes out , as our society rapidly degenerates into despotism , our shared future calls for an informed public to step up and do their duty to hold power to account .\nThe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hope in this darkness .\nOnly through our courage to truly confront injustice and act in solidarity with truthtellers , can we end this illegal prosecution of free press and reclaim our own democracy .\nAuthor \u2019 s Note : WikiLeaks has launched

priorities of the agency is to mitigate threats associated with EMPs : To combat these emerging threats , President Trump signed an executive order in March 2019 , delegating power to the White House for EMP preparedness .\nWe recently quoted Peter Vincent Pry , ex-chief of staff of the Congressional EMP Commission , who wrote an op-ed that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u201c exposed dangerous weaknesses in U.S.

Against Prohibition ( LEAP ) , now known as Law Enforcement Action Partnership , along with the National Black Police Association , and Fair and Just Prosecution have signed onto a revolutionary letter to Congress urging the federal government to legalize marijuana and expunge all past convictions relating to marijuana .\nIn addition to the three major groups signing on to the letter , dozens of current and former prosecutors , judges and police officers .\nCook County State Attorney Kim Foxx and Minnesota Attorney General Keith Ellison ( D ) also signed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ month and is addressed to Speaker Nancy Pelosi ( D-Calif. ) and House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer ( D-Md. )\n.\nIt calls on House lawmakers to \u201c swiftly bring \u201d the bill , dubbed the Marijuana Opportunity Reinvestment and Expungement ( MORE ) Act , to the floor for a vote this month .\nThe group accurately portrays the problem created by the war on marijuana and how it degrades trust in police .\nA significant driver of public distrust in law enforcement is our focus on low-level marijuana arrests .\nAs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ system , we police are already met with animosity every day .\nOur effectiveness and morale should not suffer unnecessarily .\nIf marijuana had never been criminalized , many more Americans would greet us with warmth and cooperation rather than fear and malice .\nWithout the trust of the people we serve , we lose a valuable crime-fighting resource .\nWhen community members refuse to talk to us , fail to present evidence or even to report crime , our jobs become much more difficult .\nLegalizing marijuana will help alleviate this tension @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shared priorities : responding to emergencies and curbing serious crime .\nThe resources used to enforce marijuana law violations could be shifted and used to more effectively tackle serious and violent crimes .\nAmericans were arrested for marijuana seven million times between 2001 and 2010 , the vast majority of which were just for possession .\nEven as more states legalize marijuana , police made more than 663,000 marijuana arrests \u2014 92 % of them for possession \u2014 last year alone .\nMeanwhile , homicide and sex crimes units struggle to get evidence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that evidence sits in storage for years collecting dust , predators roam free to harm more innocent people .\nThis misallocation of resources is disgraceful .\nBy legalizing marijuana at the federal level , we will send a message to every police department in this country about our real priorities .\nOur allegiance lies with crime survivors and would-be victims , not with marijuana prohibition .\nBy focusing on serious crime and creating safe neighborhoods \u2014 rather than arresting people for a drug most Americans think should be legal \u2014 we will be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back the trust of our communities Become an Activist Post Patron for $ 1 per month at Patreon .\nThis letter contains no new information .\nHowever , the fact that it is receiving coverage in the mainstream and is directed at Congress is encouraging .\nThis conversation is long overdue and it needs to change now as the war on drugs fosters a violent and criminal society .\nIt should go further , however , and move to decriminalize all substances , not just marijuana .\nAs readers of TFTP know , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the world .\nIt is estimated that victimless crime constitutes 86 % of the federal prison population .\nThat means the only reason that these individuals are incarcerated is because the state deemed their non-violent personal choices , \u201c illegal.\n\u201d The majority of that 86 % is for illegal drugs only .\nMost of the people who are thrown in prison are non-violent .\nHowever , when they are locked in cages with society \u2019 s worst and treated like cattle in a factory farm , they come out forever changed .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ environment , and they have the audacity to call this the \u201c justice system.\n\u201d This system \u2014 whether or not the right wants to admit it \u2014 disproportionately targets minorities , fostering a violent and tyrannical environment .\nThe research cited in the letter also points this fact out .\nIf you honestly believe that black lives matter , it is your duty to call for an end to the drug war .\nEnding the drug war would have profound effects on police interactions in black communities .\nNo longer would cops @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an attempt to catch black people with a substance deemed illegal by the state .\nThis would drastically reduce the amount of police interactions as a whole .\nWhat \u2019 s more , as the letter points out , it would decrease crime by eliminating the monopoly on drug sales held by organized criminal gangs .\nIt would defund the gangs and remove much of the incentive to wage violence in their community .\nTo understand why this would have such a drastic effect , you have to realize that when the government @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not remove the demand .\nInstead , the state creates crime by pushing the sale and control of these substances into the illegal black markets \u2014 usually monopolized by gang members in poor communities .\nAll the while , demand remains constant .\nBecause this market is not regulated by free market principals , safety and child possession fall to the wayside .\nThe authors of the letter understand this and point out how legalization would curb this problem .\nRegulation reduces youth access and keeps adult consumers safe .\nCriminalizing marijuana has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where there are no regulations , product testing , etc .\nResourceful teenagers do not usually have trouble accessing marijuana when it is illegal .\nUnderground sellers do not have to obtain age verification before making a sale and may sell other far more dangerous substances .\nLegalizing marijuana shrinks the size of the market available to teens , which simultaneously reduces their exposure to criminal activity in general .\nA profitable underground market supports the high demand for marijuana , much as it did during the prohibition of alcohol in the 1920s @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u201c controlled \u201d substance is illusory ; where it is illegal , we have no control .\nWe can not ensure the purity of the product , require the use of childproof containers , or determine who can buy and sell it .\nOver time , marijuana legalization will drive out the underground market , just as alcohol bootleggers disappeared after repealing alcohol prohibition .\nRight now , the underground market still flourishes because marijuana is legal in some places and not others .\nThe most impactful way to take marijuana profits away @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is to regulate marijuana similarly to how we regulate alcohol and cigarettes .\nThe illegality of drug possession and use is what keeps the low-level users and dealers in and out of the court systems , and most of these people are poor black men .\nBlack people are more likely to receive a harsher punishment for the same drug crime as a white person .\nThis revolving door of creating and processing criminals fosters the phenomenon known as Recidivism which is the tendency of those who are processed into the system and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The War on Drugs takes good people and turns them into criminals every single minute of every single day .\nThe system is set up in such a way that it fans the flames of violent crime by essentially building a factory that turns out violent criminals .\nThe system knows this too !\nAs stated by the law enforcement experts in their letter , when drugs are legalized , gang violence drops \u2014 drastically .\nNot only does it have a huge effect on the localized gangs in America , but the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ violent foreign drug cartels too .\nUntil Americans educate themselves on the cause of this violence , uninformed and corrupt lawmakers will continue to focus on controlling the symptoms .\nWe will see more senseless killings and more innocent lives stripped of opportunity by getting entangled in the system .\nWe must end the drug war now .\nMatt Agorist is an honorably discharged veteran of the USMC and

millions of dollars a year on surveillance technology in order to track , locate , watch , and listen to people in the United States , often targeting dissidents , immigrants , and people of color

the hoarding of these technologies .\nIn 2016 , the U.S. Department of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ use and deployment of police surveillance measures in the town of Calexico , California .\nOne of the most notable examples of the frivolous spending culture includes spending roughly $ 100,000 in seized assets on surveillance equipment ( such as James Bond-style spy glasses ) to dig up dirt on city council members and complaint-filing citizens with the aim of blackmail and extortion .\nAnother example : a report from the Government Accountability Office showed that U.S. Customs and Border Protection officers used money intended to buy food and medical equipment for detainees @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nDrawing attention to how police fund surveillance technology is a necessary step , not just to exposing the harm it does , but also to recognize how untransparent and unregulated the industry is .\nMassive amounts of funding for surveillance have allowed police to pay for dozens of technologies that residents have no control over , or even knowledge about .\nWhen police pay for use of predictive policing software , do town residents get an inside look at how it works before it deploys police to arrest someone ?\nNo , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u201d and the company will claim that doing so would give away trade secrets .\nSome vendors even tell police not to talk to the press about it without the company \u2019 s permission or instruct cops to leave use of the technology out of arrest reports .\nWhen law enforcement pays private companies to use automated license plate readers , what oversight do the surveilled have to make sure that data is safe ?\nNone\u2014and it often isn \u2019 t safe .\nIn 2019 , an ALPR vendor that was hacked allowed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scans to leak onto the web .\nLaw enforcement will often frame surveillance technology as being solely a solution to crime\u2013but when viewed as a thriving industry made up of vendors and buyers , we can see that police surveillance has a whole lot more to do with dollars and cents .\nAnd often it \u2019 s that money that \u2019 s driving surveillance decisions , and not the community \u2019 s interests .\nCivil asset forfeiture is a process that allows law enforcement to seize money and property from individuals suspected of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have been convicted or sometimes before they \u2019 ve even been charged .\nWhen a local law enforcement agency partners with a federal agency it can apply for a share of the resources seized through a process called \u201c equitable sharing.\n\u201d Law enforcement often spends these funds on electronic surveillance , such as wiretaps , but also on other forms of surveillance technology , such as automated license plate readers .\nWealthy individuals can have an immense impact on public safety , and are often the sources behind large scale surveillance systems @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Research , \u201d which would place a spy plane over the city , was funded in part by billionaires Laura and John Arnold , who put up $ 3.7 million to fund the program .\nAnother billionaire , Ripple \u2019 s Chris Larson , has donated millions to neighborhood business districts throughout the San Francisco Bay Area to install sophisticated camera networks to deter property crime .\nThe San Francisco Police Department was given live access to these cameras for over a week in order to spy on BLM protestors , which invaded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ordinance .\nIn Atlanta , businessman Charlie Loudermilk gave the city $ 1 million in order to create the Loudermilk Video Integration Center where police receive live feeds from public and private cameras .\nThese grants , gifts , and donations illustrate the imbalance of power when it comes to decisions about surveillance technology .\nThe federal government often pursues its nationwide surveillance goals by providing money to local law enforcement agencies .\nThe U.S. Department of Justice has an entire office devoted to these efforts : the Bureau of Justice Assistance ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ agencies can apply for sums ranging from tens of thousands to millions of dollars for police equipment , including surveillance technology .\nThrough Justice Assistance Grants ( JAGs ) , agencies have acquired license plate readers and mobile surveillance units , along with other surveillance technologies .\nBJA even has a special grant program for body-worn cameras .\nMeanwhile , the U.S. Department of Homeland Security has paid local agencies to acquire surveillance technology along the U.S.-Mexico border through the Urban Area Security Initiative and Operation Stonegarden , a program that encourages local @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nMany foundations provide technology , or funds to purchase technology , to local law enforcement .\nThis process is similar to the \u201c dark money \u201d phenomenon in election politics : anonymous donors can provide money to a non-profit , which then can pass it on to law enforcement .\nPolice foundations receive millions of dollars a year from large corporations and individual donors .\nCompanies like Starbucks , Target , Facebook , and Google all provide money to police foundations which go on to buy equipment ranging from long guns to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in 2007 , Target single-handedly paid for the software at LAPD \u2019 s new state-of-the-art surveillance center .\nBecause selling police surveillance tech is such a lucrative industry , it is no surprise that an economy has cropped up of shady and unregulated kick back schemes .\nUnder these arrangements , police receive economic incentives to promote the adoption of certain surveillance equipment\u2013in their own jurisdiction , to the people they should be protecting , and even to other towns , states , and countries .\nMicrosoft developed the sweeping city-wide surveillance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the New York City Police Department , which was built gradually over years and cost $ 30 million .\nIts formal unveiling in 2012 led Microsoft to receive a slew of requests to buy the technology from other cities .\nNow , according to the New York Times , the NYPD receives 30 % of \u201c gross revenues from the sale of the system and access to any innovations developed for new customers.\n\u201d This leads to a disturbing question that undergirds many of these public-private surveillance partnerships in which police get kickbacks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much surveillance , or are the police just profiting off its proliferation ?\nThe NYPD and Microsoft make money when a city believes it needs to invest in a large-scale surveillance system .\nThat undermines our ability to know if the system actually works at reducing crime , because its users have an economic interest in touting its effectiveness .\nIt also means that there are commercial enterprises that profit when you feel afraid of crime .\nRing , Amazon \u2019 s surveillance doorbells , now has over 1,300 partnerships with police departments @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of this arrangement , police are offered free equipment giveaways in exchange for a number of residents downloading their Neighbors app or using a town \u2019 s discount code to purchase a Ring camera .\nThese purchases are often subsidized by the town itself .\nThis raises the very troubling question : do police think you need a camera on your front door because your property is in danger , or are they hustling for a commission from Amazon when they make a sale ?\nThis arrangement is sure to deepen the public @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their public safety advice .\nHow would people know if safety tips are motivated by an attempt to sow fear , and by extension , sell cameras and build an accessible surveillance network ?\nThey Don \u2019 t Buy Surveillance Equipment , They Use Yours Throughout the country , police have been increasingly relying on private surveillance measures to do the spying they legally or economically can not do themselves .\nThis includes Ring surveillance doorbells people put on their front door , license plate readers homeowner \u2019 s associations mount at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ camera networks used by business improvement districts .\nNo matter who controls surveillance equipment , police will ask to use it .\nThus , any movement toward scrutinizing how police fund surveillance must also include scrutiny of our own decisions as private consumers .\nThe choice of individuals to install their own invasive technology ultimately enables police abuse of the technology .\nIt also allows police to circumvent measures of transparency and accountability that apply to government-owned surveillance technology .\nCommunity Control of Police Surveillance ( CCOPS ) measures around the country are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the purchase and use of surveillance tech .\nBut there are still too few of these laws ensuring democratic control over acquisition and application of police technology .\nWith police departments increasingly spending more and more money for access to face recognition , video surveillance , automated license plate readers , and dozens of other specific pieces of surveillance tech , it \u2019 s time to scrutinize the many dubious and opaque funding streams that bankroll them .\nBut oversight alone will likely never be enough , because funding is in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , new technologies are always on the rise , and their uses mostly go unregulated and undisclosed .\nSo we must push for huge cuts in spending on police surveillance technology across the nation .\nThis is a necessary step

Paul Duprex , revealed UPMC \u2019 s efforts to access the SARS-CoV-2 virus , he announced that the virus samples , containing an estimated 50 to 60 million coronavirus particles , were already en route to the university .\nAt the time , UPMC was one of only a handful of institutions on the CDC \u2019 s short list to receive live SARS-CoV-2 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ began work on a vaccine for Covid-19 on January 21st , weeks before the February 14th announcement that the virus was on its way to the university .\nThat original vaccine candidate used the published genetic sequence of SARS-CoV-2 , released in early January 2020 by Chinese researchers , to synthetically produce SARS-CoV-2 spike proteins that would be transported into cells by an adenoviral vector , which is commonly used in a variety of vaccines .\nThe vaccine candidate was nicknamed PittCoVacc , short for Pittsburgh Coronavirus Vaccine .\nA little over a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ received by UPMC \u2019 s Center for Vaccine Research , UPMC received a $ 5 million grant from the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations ( CEPI ) , an international organization founded in 2017 by the governments of Norway and India along with the World Economic Forum and the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation .\nThe grant was officially awarded to \u201c an international academic-industry partnership \u201d that the Center for Vaccine Research had recently formed with the Institut Pasteur in France and Austrian vaccine manufacturer Themis .\nSoon after , in May @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Merck , which began recruiting volunteers for human trials earlier this month on September 11 .\nMerck has incredibly close ties with UPMC , particularly its commercialization arm known as UPMC Enterprises .\nThe CEPI grant seems to have drastically altered the Center for Vaccine Research \u2019 s interest in the original adenovirus-vector vaccine candidate , PittCoVacc , as the CEPI grant was specifically aimed at funding a different vaccine candidate that instead uses the measles virus as a vector .\nThe measles virus and the genetic manipulation of measles for use in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the principal research interest and expertise of Center for Vaccine Research director Paul Duprex .\nThis measles-based vaccine candidate has been described as \u201c a modified [ genetically altered ] measles virus that delivers bits of the new coronavirus into the body to prevent Covid-19 \u201d as well as an \u201c attenuated [ genetically modified yet weakened ] measles virus as a vector with which to introduce genetic material from SARS- [ CoV- ] 2 to the immune system.\n\u201d The combination of this weakened measles virus and SARS-CoV-2 , per Duprex , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of coronavirus [ that ] will acquaint a person \u2019 s immune system \u201d with SARS-CoV-2 .\nNo vaccine using this modality has ever been licensed .\nOn April 2nd , less than a week after the CEPI award had been announced , the UPMC researchers who had developed the original vaccine candidate using the more traditional adenovirus-vector approach published a study in EBioMedicine ( a publication of the medical journal Lancet ) that reported promising results of their vaccine candidate in animal studies .\nThe news that a US institution was among @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a Covid-19 vaccine candidate with promising results from an animal study was heavily amplified by mainstream US media outlets , with those reports noting that UMPC was requesting government permission to quickly move onto human trials .\nThis original vaccine candidate , however , was mysteriously dropped from subsequent reports and statements from UPMC regarding its Covid-19 vaccine efforts .\nIndeed , in recent months , Duprex \u2019 s statements on the center \u2019 s Covid-19 vaccine candidates no longer mention the once-promising PittCoVacc at all .\nInstead , new reports , citing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vaccine candidates are the CEPI-funded measles-vaccine candidate and another , more mysterious vaccine candidate , whose nature has only been recently revealed by documents obtained through a Freedom of Information Act ( FOIA ) request .\nEqually odd is that recent media reports on the original vaccine candidate have stopped mentioning UPMC at all , instead citing only Themis , its new owner Merck , and France \u2019 s Institut Pasteur .\nThere are no reports indicating a break-up of the original \u201c academic-industry partnership \u201d that had received the CEPI grant .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ have come to pass , as Duprex stated that the UPMC measles-vector vaccine candidate had partnered with the Serum Institute of India for mass production , first for trials and then for public use , depending on how the vaccine advances through the regulatory process .\nIn contrast , Themis/Merck have stated that their vaccine is being produced in France .\nIt remains unclear what the relation is between these two , and apparently analogous , vaccine candidates .\nThough Duprex has been relatively forthcoming about the nature of the first UPMC vaccine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ measles-vector vaccine ) , he has been much more tight-lipped about its second vaccine candidate .\nIn late August , he told the Pittsburgh Business Times that the second vaccine candidate that UPMC was developing \u201c works by delivering genetic material coding for a viral protein instead of the entire weakened or killed virus as is standard in other vaccines.\n\u201d Yet Duprex declined to state what vector will be used to deliver the genetic material into human cells .\nRecent FOIA revelations , nevertheless , have revealed that UPMC \u2019 s second @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of SARS-Cov-2 and anthrax , a substance better known for its potential use as a bioweapon .\nThe recently obtained documents reveal that the BSL-3 lab that is part of UPMC \u2019 s Center for Vaccine Research is conducting eyebrow-raising research involving combining SARS-CoV-2 with Bacillus anthracis , the causative agent of anthrax infection .\nPer the documents , anthrax is being genetically engineered by a researcher , whose name was redacted in the release , so that it will express the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein , which is the part of the coronavirus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ human cells .\nThe researcher asserts that \u201c the [ genetically engineered anthrax/SARS-CoV-2 hybrid ] can [ be ] used as a host strain to make SARS-CoV-2 recombinant S protein vaccine , \u201d and the creation of said vaccine is the officially stated purpose of the research project .\nThe documents were produced by the University of Pittsburgh \u2019 s Institutional Biosafety Committee ( IBC ) , which held an emergency meeting on June 22nd of this year to \u201c discuss specific protocols involving research with the coronavirus , \u201d which included a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hammond , the former director of the Sunshine Project , an organization that opposed chemical and biological weapons and the expansion of \u201c dual use \u201d biodefense/bioweapon research , obtained the documents .\nOther FOIA documents recently obtained by Hammond have revealed an \u201c explosion \u201d of risky Covid-19-related research at other academic institutions , such as the University of North Carolina , which has already had lab accidents involving genetically engineered variants of SARS-CoV-2 .\nHammond told The Last American Vagabond that the experiment , which he dubs \u201c Corona-thrax , \u201d @ @ @ @ @ @ @ excesses that often characterize the response of scientists to the federal government throwing billions of dollars at health crises.\n\u201d Hammond added , \u201c While I don \u2019 t think that Corona-thrax would be infectious , it falls into the categories of pointless and crazy .\nThe biggest immediate risk of all this activity is that a researcher will deliberately or inadvertently create a modified form of SARS-CoV-2 that is even more difficult to treat , or more deadly , and this virus will escape the lab .\nIt only takes a stray @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who previously taught at the University of Wisconsin and who is the current editor of Independent Science News , agreed with Hammond that the Corona-thrax experiment is odd and said that he was \u201c concerned here specifically about the research process and the risks of these specific experiments at Pittsburgh.\n\u201d In an interview with The Last American Vagabond , Latham asserted that it is \u201c unusual by historical standards .\n.\n.\nthe combining of two highly pathogenic organisms in a single experiment.\n\u201d He did note , however , that such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have become more common in recent years , as is made clear in a 2012 study .\nFew experiments have been conducted that specifically utilize anthrax in this way .\nSince 2000 , the studies that have examined the use of genetically modified anthrax as a potential vaccine vector have been affiliated with Harvard University .\nOne of these studies was on the use of anthrax as a vector in a potential HIV vaccine and was jointly conducted in 2000 by Harvard researchers and the vaccine company Avant Immunotherapeutics ( now part of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ results in their experiments , Avant/Celldex did not fund further experiments into a vaccine that used this anthrax-based modality , and it does not currently market or have any such vaccine in its product pipeline .\nThis suggests that , for whatever reason , this company did not see much value in this vaccine , despite the preliminary study with Harvard claiming that the methodology was safe and effective .\nThe Harvard researchers involved in that 2000 study , however , continued to investigate the possibility of an anthrax-based HIV vaccine in 2003 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ without corporate sponsorship .\nRelated yet different research has explored the use of \u201c disarmed \u201d anthrax components as an adjuvant in vaccines and as the basis for enzyme-linked immunospot assays .\nThe aforementioned Harvard researchers patented their methodology of using anthrax in this way for the production of a vaccine in 2002 .\nThis means that the anthrax-based \u201c vaccine \u201d currently being developed by UPMC \u2019 s Center for Vaccine Research would have to develop a new method that utilizes anthrax in much the same way so as not to infringe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nThe other alternative is that UPMC would pay the patent holders for use of their methodology if they want to commercialize it in a vaccine .\nYet , given UPMC \u2019 s business model in general , as well as that of UPMC \u2019 s Center for Vaccine Research specifically , this also seems unlikely .\nAlso odd is what sort of incentive UPMC \u2019 s Center for Vaccine Research possesses for the Corona-thrax experiment .\nThere are currently over a hundred vaccine candidates that use existing and tested vaccine platforms in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fact Duprex himself has acknowledged .\nAs Hammond told The Last American Vagabond , \u201c It is perfectly obvious that there are numerous existing vaccine platforms for Covid-19 and that some of them will , sooner or more likely later , succeed .\nThere is no serious need for some sort of quite strange bacterial platform , much less one that happens to be anthrax .\nIt \u2019 s completely unnecessary and frankly bizarre.\n\u201d The Crown Jewel of the Biotech-Industrial Complex The Corona-thrax experiment is being conducted at the Center for Vaccine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ RBL ) , where the center \u2019 s work with pathogenic agents , such as anthrax and SARS-CoV-2 , is conducted .\nThe creation of UPMC \u2019 s RBL was first announced in 2003 , when the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases ( NIAID , then and currently led by Anthony Fauci ) stated it would fund the laboratory \u2019 s construction with an $ 18 million grant .\nIt was originally planned to be mainly \u201c dedicated to research on agents that cause naturally occurring and emerging infections , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The plan to create the lab was part of the US government decision to dramatically ramp up \u201c biodefense \u201d research in the wake of the 2001 anthrax attacks .\nThe lab was also intended to work on \u201c developing a vaccine program focusing on basic and translational research \u201d related to viruses of pandemic potential that are at risk of being \u201c weaponized , \u201d including SARS .\nAfter the creation of the lab was initially announced , the project expanded , eventually becoming UPMC \u2019 s Center for Vaccine Research , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Center for Vaccine Research was the second such institution to be officially added to the NIAID \u2019 s \u201c biodefense \u201d RBL network .\nThe opening of both this lab and UPMC \u2019 s Center for Vaccine Research was made reality thanks to the efforts of the main authors of the June 2001 Dark Winter bioterror simulation , a controversial exercise that eerily predicted the 2001 anthrax attacks as well as the initial , yet bogus , narrative that Iraq and Islamic extremist terror groups were responsible for those attacks .\nHowever , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ later revealed to be of US military origin .\nAs noted in Part I of this series , participants in the Dark Winter exercise had foreknowledge of the anthrax attacks and others were involved in the subsequent \u201c investigation , \u201d which many experts and former FBI investigators describe as a cover-up .\nDark Winter was largely written by Tara O \u2019 Toole , Thomas Inglesby , and Randall Larsen , all three of whom played integral roles in the founding or operations of UPMC \u2019 s Center for Biosecurity , along with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ D. A. Henderson .\nUPMC \u2019 s Center for Biosecurity was launched in September 2003 , just days before the NIAID announced it would fund the RBL lab that would later become the UPMC \u2019 s Center for Vaccine Research .\nNotably , just days after the attacks on September 11 , 2001 , O \u2019 Toole , Inglesby , and Larsen personally briefed Vice President Cheney on Dark Winter .\nSimultaneously , Cheney \u2019 s office at the White House began taking the antibiotic Ciprofloxacin to prevent anthrax infection .\nIn the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anthrax attacks , Dark Winter participants and several associates of Cheney , namely members of the Project for a New American Century ( PNAC ) like Donald Kagan and Richard Perle , asserted that a bioterror attack involving anthrax would soon take place .\nIn the aftermath of the 2001 anthrax attacks , Henderson \u201c was tapped by the federal government to vastly increase the number of [ biodefense ] labs , both to detect suspected pathogens like anthrax and to conduct bio-defense research , such as developing vaccines , \u201d with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ part of the launch of the O \u2019 Toole-led Center for Biosecurity at UPMC , where Henderson was named senior adviser .\nIn 2003 , the Center for Biosecurity was set up at UPMC partially at the request of Jeffrey Romoff to be \u201c the country \u2019 s only think tank and research center devoted to the prevention and handling of biological attacks , \u201d with UPMC \u2019 s Center for Vaccine Research being the hub of a new \u201c biodefense research \u201d lab network Henderson was setting up and managing at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the Fauci-led NIAID .\nAlso noteworthy is that the Center for Vaccine Research \u2019 s director , from its opening in 2007 until 2016 , was Donald Burke .\nBurke is a former biodefense researcher for the US military at Fort Detrick and other installations and , immediately prior to heading the UPMC center , was a program director at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health , where he worked closely with O \u2019 Toole and Inglesby .\nAt the time of the 2003 announcement regarding the creation of what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Vaccine Research , Tara O \u2019 Toole stated : A few years later , after she was nominated to a top post at the Department of Homeland Security , O \u2019 Toole was slammed by experts over her excessive lobbying \u201c for a massive biodefense expansion and relaxation of provisions for safety and security.\n\u201d Rutgers microbiologist Richard Ebright remarked at the time that \u201c she makes Dr. Strangelove look sane.\n\u201d It was also noted in hearings that O \u2019 Toole had worked as a lobbyist for several \u201c life sciences \u201d @ @ @ @ @ @ @ products to the U.S. government , including Emergent Biosolutions \u2013 a very controversial company and a key suspect in the 2001 anthrax attacks .\nThe history of the Center for Vaccine Research \u2019 s RBL , particularly the network of people who prompted the lab \u2019 s creation , raises concerns about the nature of the Corona-thrax experiment currently being conducted within the facility .\nThis is especially true because the researcher conducting the experiment appears to be ignorant about key parts of the research he or she is conducting .\nFor instance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a recombinant virus proposed for use in the study is incapable of infecting human cells , while the IBC members note that this is not the case .\nIn addition , the unnamed researcher falsely claimed that one of the viral vectors for use in the investigator \u2019 s study did not express Cas9 ( a protein associated with CRISPR gene editing ) and gRNA ( \u201c guide RNA , \u201d also used in CRISPR ) and was unaware that handling those agents requires an enhanced BSL-2 lab ( BSL-2+ ) as opposed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such errors among researchers involved in Covid-19 research at UPMC is not an anomaly .\nDuring another UPMC IBC meeting included in the FOIA release , the IBC noted the following about a separate research proposal : This part , in particular , caught the attention of Jonathan Latham , who noted that it was odd that \u201c a university researcher is trying to obtain approval for an experiment which no one at the university is allowed to do.\n\u201d Latham added in an interview that \u201c apparently this applicant is totally ignorant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the risks of SARS-CoV , which is a highly infectious virus whose escape from a lab has already led to at least one death.\n\u201d While Latham assumed that this was a \u201c university researcher , \u201d it is worth noting that the use of the UPMC Center for Vaccine Research \u2019 s RBL is not exclusive to researchers affiliated with the university .\nIndeed , as noted on the NIH website , \u201c Investigators in academia , not-for-profit organizations , industry , and government studying biodefense and emerging infectious diseases may request @ @ @ @ @ @ @ including the RBL managed by the Center for Vaccine Research .\nIn addition , the Center for Vaccine Research website notes that \u201c scientists from outside the University of Pittsburgh can work in the RBL through a collaboration or contract .\nOutside scientists must comply with all University of Pittsburgh training , documentation , regulatory , and medical requirements.\n\u201d This means that outside scientists using the facility are also subject to IBC review .\nBoth the NIH and Center for Vaccine Research sites note that , for an outside researcher to use @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the center \u2019 s director must be obtained .\nSince the name of the Corona-thrax researcher is redacted , there is no way of knowing if he or she is affiliated with the university or a separate institution , corporation , or government agency .\nRegardless of who is conducting this experiment , however , it is possible to examine the history and motivations of the man who ultimately signed off on it\u2014the Center for Vaccine Research \u2019 s director , Paul Duprex .\nPaul Duprex is a former chief scientist for Johnson @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was largely funded with research grants from the NIH and the Pentagon \u2019 s Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency ( DARPA ) .\nMuch of Duprex \u2019 s research has focused on recombinant ( i. e. , genetically engineered ) viruses or viral evolution .\nIn terms of his research funded by DARPA , Duprex was most closely associated with DARPA \u2019 s \u201c Prophecy \u201d program , the creation of which was overseen by Michael Callahan .\nCallahan \u2019 s suspect past and his ties to the origin of the current Covid-19 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the subject of a recent Unlimited Hangout article by Raul Diego .\nIn that article , Diego notes that the now-defunct Prophecy program had \u201c sought to \u2018 transform the vaccine and drug development enterprise from observational and reactive to predictive and preemptive \u2019 through algorithmic programming techniques \u201d and that the program further \u201c proposed that \u2018 viral mutations and outbreaks \u2019 could be predicted in advance to more rapidly counter the unknown disease with preemptive drug and vaccine development.\n\u201d By all indications , Prophecy was DARPA \u2019 s first major @ @ @ @ @ @ @ care , which has expanded considerably in the years since .\nIt also involved a component , which Duprex was particularly involved in advancing , whereby the \u201c predictive \u201d viral evolutions algorithms would be \u201c validated and tested .\n.\n.\nby using multiple selective pressures on at least three closely related virus strains in an experimental setting.\n\u201d Such experiments , like this study by Duprex , involved the genetic engineering of three viral pathogen strains and then seeing which would become most transmissible and virulent in an animal host .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ gain-of-function ( GOF ) research and are incredibly controversial given that they often create pathogens that are more virulent and/or transmissible than they otherwise would be .\nIt is also worth noting that UPMC , before Duprex joined the center , had also received millions in funding from DARPA \u2019 s Prophecy program \u201c to develop in vitro and computational models for predicting viral evolution under selection pressure from multiple evolutionary stressors.\n\u201d Duprex has also been involved in conducting research for DARPA \u2019 s current INTERfering and Co-Evolving Prevention and Therapy ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Prophecy that \u201c aims to harness viral evolution to create a novel , adaptive form of medical countermeasure\u2014therapeutic interfering particles ( TIPs ) \u2014that outcompetes viruses in the body to prevent or treat infection.\n\u201d TIPs are genetically engineered viruses with defective genomes that theoretically compete with real viruses for viral components in the human body but \u201c evolve with \u201d the viruses they are meant to protect the body against and are \u201c susceptible to mutation over time.\n\u201d The goal of the INTERCEPT program is to use TIPs as \u201c therapeutics @ @ @ @ @ @ @ human body to \u201c preemptively \u201d protect against the virus from which a particular TIP was developed .\nIt is worth noting that , while DARPA frames much of its gene-editing research ( including its \u201c genetic extinction \u201d technology research ) as being aimed at promoting either human or environmental health , it has also openly admitted that these same technologies are of interest to DARPA for their ability to \u201c subvert \u201d the genes of human adversaries of the US military via \u201c genetic weapons.\n\u201d Duprex led an INTERCEPT study @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which he and his coauthors explored how to create a synthetic TIP of the Nipah virus , a deadly virus with a fatality rate of over 70 percent .\nIn that study , they used both wild and genetically engineered strains of Nipah virus .\nNotably , the Clade X pandemic simulation , which will be discussed in detail in the next installment of this series , involved a genetically engineered combination of the Nipah virus and a parainfluenza disease .\nClade X took place in 2018 and was led by much of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the 2001 Dark Winter bioterrorism simulation , including former FDA commissioner Margaret Hamburg and Tara O \u2019 Toole and Thomas Inglesby of the UPMC Center for Biosecurity .\nAnother notable participant at Clade X was Julie Gerberding , former CDC director and current executive vice president at Merck , which has close ties to UPMC as well as the Center for Biosecurity \u2019 s failed \u201c 21st Century Biodefense \u201d project .\nA few months after publishing the study funded by DARPA \u2019 s INTERCEPT program , Duprex coauthored another study on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ i. e. , bioengineered synthetic nanoparticles acting as antibodies ) that was published in August .\nThis effort mirrors other DARPA \u201c health-focused \u201d projects .\nThat study was funded by the University of Pittsburgh , the NIH , and Israel \u2019 s Ministry of Science and Technology .\nIn addition to his ties to DARPA programs involving the genetic engineering of viral pathogens , Duprex is a leading advocate for controversial gain-of-function research and was appointed to direct UPMC \u2019 s Center for Vaccine Research less than three months after the federal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ October 2014 , five days after that moratorium was first imposed , Duprex gave a talk to the National Science Advisory Board for Biosecurity entitled \u201c Gain-of-Function Studies : Their History , Their Utility , and What They Can Tell Us.\n\u201d In the talk , he asserted that \u201c cross-species infection studies have already helped to improve surveillance in the field , have shed new light on basic influenza virus biology , and could assist in growing vaccine viruses better \u201d and argues against the recently imposed moratorium .\nIn 2014 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Nature that \u201c GOF approaches are absolutely essential in infectious disease research ; although alternative approaches can be very useful , these can never replace GOF experiments.\n\u201d He added that , in his view , there were only two reasons for GOF research , the first being to \u201c improve surveillance or to develop therapeutics \u201d and the second being merely to learn \u201c interesting biology.\n\u201d In that same paper , he also argued that \u201c genetic engineering that is intended and likely to endow a low-pathogenicity , low-transmissibility agent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may be appropriate if the benefits are substantial.\n\u201d He also suggested in this 2014 paper that it \u201c might \u201d be necessary \u201c to enhance pathogenicity of coronaviruses in order to develop a valid animal model for coronaviruses.\n\u201d Years later , during the current coronavirus crisis , Duprex and other officials from the UPMC \u2019 s Center for Vaccine Research co-developed a Covid-19 research and development \u201c blueprint \u201d for the UN \u2019 s World Health Organization .\nIn addition , Duprex \u2019 s work for DARPA \u2019 s Prophecy program @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and the creator of that program , Michael Callahan \u2013 former head of DARPA \u2019 s biodefense therapeutics initiatives , is also a proponent of GOF who believes that such risky research is inseparable from \u201c the research and development enterprise in the life sciences and for biotechnology.\n\u201d Duprex is also a founding member of Scientists for Science , a group of researchers ( most of whom are involved in GOF research ) who opposed the GOF moratorium and were \u201c confident that biomedical research on potentially dangerous pathogens can be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ comprehensive understanding of microbial disease pathogenesis , prevention and treatment.\n\u201d Another of the group \u2019 s founding members is Yoshihiro Kawaoka , whose controversial GOF experiments that made pathogenic viruses more deadly have garnered considerable media attention .\nWhen the moratorium on GOF was lifted in December 2017 , Duprex called it a \u201c sign of progress , \u201d adding that \u201c on a personal level I \u2019 m really pleased these NIH funded scientists [ conducting GOF research ] get some clarity.\n\u201d As previously mentioned , he became the Center @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than three months later , in March 2018 .\nAfter a cursory examination of the background of UPMC , its Regional Biocontainment Laboratory , and the man directing its Center for Vaccine Research , the question about the nature of the Corona-thrax experiment becomes : Is this yet another ill-advised experiment by a lab led by a GOF enthusiast and fueled by a feeding frenzy over the billions of dollars thrown by the government and other entities into Covid-19 research ?\nOr is there perhaps a more nefarious motive to genetically engineering something @ @ @ @ @ @ @ latter question may appear conspiratorial , it is worth pointing out that the institutions most likely to have been the sources for the anthrax used in the 2001 anthrax attacks were conducting GOF research on anthrax funded by the Pentagon and the CIA that was justified as \u201c improving \u201d the controversial anthrax vaccine known as BioThrax .\nFor instance , Battelle Memorial Institute\u2014a Pentagon and CIA contractor\u2014began genetically engineering a more virulent form of anthrax \u201c to see if the [ anthrax ] vaccine the United States intends to supply to its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u201d While these experiments were going on , the embattled manufacturer of the anthrax vaccine now known as Emergent Biosolutions , entered into a contract with Battelle that gave Battelle \u201c immediate exposure to the vaccine \u201d it was using in connection with the genetically modified anthrax program .\nAs noted in Part II of this series , BioPort was set to lose its Pentagon contract for anthrax vaccine entirely in September 2001 , and the entirety of its anthrax vaccine business was rescued by the 2001 anthrax attacks , which saw concerns @ @ @ @ @ @ @ horrendous safety track record replaced with fervent demands for more of its anthrax vaccine .\nFurthermore , as noted in detail in Part III of this series , Battelle was the most likely source of the anthrax used in the 2001 attacks .\nThe ties between UPMC \u2019 s Center for Biosecurity , Battelle , and Emergent Biosolutions will be discussed in the next installment in the series .\nWhat is also notable about these Corona-thrax experiments occurring at UPMC are the ties of UPMC \u2019 s RBL and Center for Vaccine Research @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u2019 s \u201c biodefense \u201d complex , the UPMC Center for Biosecurity .\nAs previously mentioned , the people recruited to head this center at its founding in 2003 were intimately involved in the 2001 bioterror simulation Dark Winter , namely Tara O \u2019 Toole and Thomas Inglesby .\nWhile leading the UPMC \u2019 s Center for Biosecurity , O \u2019 Toole and/or her successor Inglesby engaged in other notable bioterror simulations , including one that took place last year\u2014 Event 201 , which eerily predicted the coronavirus crisis that began this year @ @ @ @ @ @ @ director of the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security in addition to his post at UPMC , was the moderator at Event 201 .\nThough Event 201 has garnered considerable scrutiny in recent months , another but less well-known exercise in 2018 that involved O \u2019 Toole and Inglesby , examined how a bioterror attack involving a genetically engineered pathogen could trigger a Continuity of Government ( CoG ) scenario , a government roadmap for the imposition of martial law in the United States .\nAs other investigative series of mine have noted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of intelligence agency-linked simulations that predict the imminent imposition of martial law in the United States following the 2020 election .\nIt is also notable that George W. Bush \u2019 s controversial and classified update to CoG plans in 2007 , known as Executive Directive 51 , was directly inspired by Dark Winter , and Barack Obama \u2019 s subsequent executive orders on CoG gave near-complete control of American infrastructure to the Department of Homeland Security in a such a situation .\nAt the time Obama issued those executive orders , O \u2019 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and technology and also influenced those updates to the CoG plans .\nO \u2019 Toole is currently the executive vice president of the CIA \u2019 s In-Q-tel .\nThe simulation known as Clade X will be examined in greater detail in the next installment of this series as will the numerous and recent \u201c predictions \u201d from US government sources , controversial billionaires such as Bill Gates , and a web of individuals tied to UPMC who have warned that a bioterror attack or related public health catastrophe is set to take place @ @ @ @ @ @ @ half of 2020 .\nAs one high-ranking government official put it earlier this year , this allegedly imminent event will result in \u201c the darkest winter in modern history.\n\u201d Whitney Webb is a staff writer for The Last American Vagabond

packages the proteins in nanoparticles .\nThe idea behind these vax is the same as \u2018 normal \u2019 vaccines , because the proteins are designed to look like the ones the rona is said to make (

vaccines are being developed for the alleged* rona virus , but the ones that deserve the most attention are the ones winning contracts and/or being trialled already , because their success is almost guaranteed .\nSome people want them , some never think about it , and others worry they could be coerced or physically forced to get them .\nThe thing is , everyone should have access to information so they can make informed choices about what is right .\nTwo of these ronavax are vaguely similar to the kind of vaccines that have been licensed in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sanofi/GSK \u2013 selected for Operation Warp Speed in the U.S. , this vaccine contains proteins that are made in a bioreactor , using genetically engineered baculoviruses and insect cells .\nThis is a method of protein engineering .\nNovavax , also funded by the US government uses a similar technique , but packages the proteins in nanoparticles .\nThe idea behind these vax is the same as \u2018 normal \u2019 vaccines , because the proteins are designed to look like the ones the rona is said to make ( usually referred to as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) so that your body reacts to them as if they were \u2018 the real thing \u2019 .\nBecome an Activist Post Patron for $ 1 per month at Patreon .\nAll the others are genetic vaccines , or \u2018 genvax \u2019 .\nThey are very experimental , because they gain access to your cells and get you to be the bioreactor and make the proteins yourself .\nThis is done by smuggling genetic instructions into your cells , using one of three methods : \u2022 Adenoviruses which have been genetically modified to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of interest ( used by AstraZeneca and J & J/Janssen ) \u2022 Lipid nanoparticles with mRNA ( used by Pfizer/BioNTech , Curevac , and Moderna ) \u2022 DNA plasmids ( used by INOVIO , a company worth noting because of its novel techniques , strategic partnerships and product pipeline ) They are all \u2018 delivery vehicles \u2019 or \u2018 vectors \u2019 \u2013 a way to get the DNA/mRNA into your cells .\nThey are all methods used in gene therapy .\nIf the ronavax are licensed , not only could gene therapy become @ @ @ @ @ @ @ genetic patents could be loosened .\nMost current gene therapy products are for very specific conditions , e.g .\nLUXTURNA which uses the RPE65 gene for patients with an inherited retinal disease .\nHowever , because genvax use the same techniques , getting the ronavax to market could begin a new era of busy production lines in bio-factories , meaning they could also churn out some of the other \u2018 therapeutics \u2019 that have been planned .\nDNA and mRNA are said to be \u2018 the software of life \u2019 and the possibilities @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are the dangers .\nBecause , whilst the platform or vector remain the same , the software doesn \u2019 t .\nFor each new application , or disease , a new genetic code is designed on computers .\nThen , the new code is added to the chosen vector , whether it \u2019 s synthetic adenoviruses , bacterial plasmids , or nanoparticles .\nAnd each new code is a new risk .\nSo , perhaps , is combining the codes \u2013 having more than one genetic vaccine , or drug , could create @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have patents which describe the use of XNA ( xeno nucleic acids ) , as well as the lab-made DNA/mRNA \u2013 and all sorts of other things you might not realise !\nSince they are all genetic vaccines , let \u2019 s call them \u2018 genvax \u2019 .\nThey are very hard to understand when nobody has explained anything , but this series of articles will give information on some of the basics so you can wrap your head around it all !\n[ *The rona virus can only be \u2018 alleged \u2019 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rona tests are detecting , and any illness deemed to be \u2018 covid \u2019 , has been established .\nAll we have to go on is \u2018 the news \u2019 , anecdotal reports , guesses , and a genetic sequence of \u2018 the rona \u2019 provided by Zhang and Holmes by January 10th , 2020 , and the abomination of \u2018 involving covid \u2019 in the statistics .\nBe sure , at least , to check the mortality figures provided by your government and compare them to previous years !\nMost of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ already ill and old , and the lockdown meant their level of care was substantially reduced . ]\nThe top seven ronavax , in terms of contracts awarded , are described below .\nBear in mind that all of these vaccines : \u2022 Are genetically modified or engineered ( and some of them also contain genetic instructions for the body ) .\n\u2022 Have been in development for a range of diseases for over 30 years .\n\u2022 Received funding and support from the big boys .\n\u2022 Can be tested and produced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ companies that make them ( although hardly anyone is trained to do this because it \u2019 s never been done before ) .\n\u2022 Have NEVER been licensed .\nOnly a handful of DNA vaccines have ever been licensed but they are all for veterinary use ( e.g .\nfor pigs and chickens ) .\n\u2022 AZD1222 ; replication-deficient chimpanzee adenovirus vector ; developed with Oxford University , and originally called ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 ; this vector has been used in trials

451 , you might remember Ray Bradbury \u2019 s classic for its portrayal of a dystopian future in which an authoritarian government burns books .\nRead Fahrenheit 451 again to discover why people wanted their tyrannical government to burn books .\nBradbury wrote Fahrenheit 451 in 1953 , yet the parallels to today \u2019 s social climate for censorship are haunting .\nBradbury \u2019 s protagonist is Guy Montag , who , like all firemen in Bradbury \u2019 s future , burns books .\nIn Bradbury \u2019 s dystopia @ @ @ @ @ @ @ peace of mind , the focus of our understandable and rightful dread of being inferior ; official censors , judges , and executors.\n\u201d Today \u2019 s mainstream and social media are \u201c custodians of our peace of mind \u201d as they filter out \u201c conflicting theory and thought.\n\u201d Captain Beatty is Montag \u2019 s boss .\nBeatty explained , \u201c If you don \u2019 t want a man unhappy politically , don \u2019 t give him two sides to a question to worry him ; give him one.\n\u201d If you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such as Covid-19 policy , Beatty has the ticket : \u201c Cram them full of noncombustible data , chock them so damned full of \u2018 facts \u2019 they feel stuffed , but absolutely \u2018 brilliant \u2019 with information .\nThen they \u2019 ll feel they \u2019 re thinking , they \u2019 ll get a sense of motion without moving.\n\u201d Today , millions listen daily to reports of case counts of Covid-19 .\nLike Bradbury predicted , listeners can recite the numbers but have no context to make sense of the numbers .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ and doctors have advocated alternatives to lockdowns that could save lives and abate catastrophic impacts on economies .\nAs in Bradbury \u2019 s world , many are working tirelessly to disparage and censor alternative views .\nAfter Montag questions his role as a book burner , he recites Dover Beach by Matthew Arnold to neighbors .\nHis neighbors were shocked at the feelings the poem provoked .\nOne cries out , \u201c Silly words , silly words , silly awful hurting words\u2026 Why do people want to hurt people ?\nNot enough hurt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ got to tease people with stuff like that !\n\u201d Incredibly , Bradbury anticipated today \u2019 s social climate where people claim censorship is justified because someone hurt their feelings .\nBeatty explains a dominant social norm justifying censorship : Do not offend minorities .\nBradbury is clear ; \u201c minorities \u201d meant practically everyone : Pretending you can \u201c stay happy all the time \u201d was another social norm driving popular demand for censorship in Fahrenheit 451 .\nBeatty explains , In Bradbury \u2019 s dystopia , to consider conflicting theories makes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fireman \u2019 s mission and justifies censorship : In Bradbury \u2019 s future , intellectuals came under scrutiny when ideas conflicted .\nThe word \u201c intellectual \u201d became a \u201c swear word.\n\u201d The public dreaded \u201c the unfamiliar \u201d and disdained a world where merit mattered .\nAgain , Bradbury has Beatty explain the mindset behind such thinking : In Bradbury \u2019 s dystopia , thinking was not welcome .\nEven front porches were eliminated .\nOne of Montag \u2019 s young neighbors explained why : Social distancing is today embraced as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Covid-19 .\nSocial distancing also keeps us safe from \u201c conflicting theories and thoughts.\n\u201d Chairs have been removed from social gathering places .\nHallways are quiet .\nNobody stands around the water cooler .\nPeople have few places to talk with each other .\nThe parallel to porches is haunting .\nPerhaps you are sensing a shift in social norms undermining parental rights and the sanctity of the family .\nBradbury foresaw a push for government-funded pre-school .\nCaptain Beatty explains , Bradbury also anticipated today \u2019 s justification of looting .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ property , not people .\nBefore he began to see the evil he was part of , Montag eased his conscience with this similar line of thinking : Warning his readers of policies shaped by the majority , Bradbury writes , Today , politicians claim the right to destroy freedom when they get a majority vote of the people .\nThis dangerous reasoning is antithetical to the founding principles of this country .\nWe can take a lesson from Bradbury \u2019 s character Professor Faber , who recognized the consequences of his own @ @ @ @ @ @ @ claiming they are \u201c woke , \u201d progressives clamor for tyranny and censorship .\nIn Bradbury \u2019 s world the \u201c woke \u201d saw through the lies of tyranny and censorship .\nBradbury would exhort us to avoid expediency and speak out to prevent the worst .\nIn his novel , Bradbury didn \u2019 t take a deep dive into the psychology of saying nothing .\nMy recent essay on mask mandates by businesses provoked a strong response .\nMany were sympathetic to my point that businesses respond to consumer demand .\nYet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ being shaped by a small but frightened and very vocal minority who complain loudly to managers about customers not wearing a mask .\nGoing against the vocal herd takes courage .\nIn his book The Heart Aroused , poet David Whyte , who works with businesses on organizational change issues , shares a universal story : Whyte explains the CEO made it plain he wanted to hear \u201c ten.\n\u201d Whyte \u2019 s friend thinks the plan is terrible , and rumors are that other executives feel the same .\nAs the CEO @ @ @ @ @ @ @ s friend hears his colleague , one by one , say \u201c ten.\n\u201d When it is his turn , \u201c against everything he believes , ( Whyte \u2019 s friend ) hears a mouselike , faraway voice , his own , saying \u2018 ten.\n\u2019 \u201d According to Elisabeth Noelle-Neumann \u2019 s theory of the spiral of silence , \u201c our willingness to express an opinion is a direct result of how popular or unpopular we perceive it to be.\n\u201d When we believe our belief is popular , we will make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ part of the herd .\nLike Whyte \u2019 s friend , we will avoid expressing our point of view when we sense it will be unpopular .\nIf you think the public is empowered by social media to express unpopular views , you would be mistaken .\nAs in Fahrenheit 451 , people censor themselves first , even before Facebook and Twitter add their own censorship .\nIn 2014 , the Pew Research Center surveyed the public about their willingness to freely express their views about the 2013 Edward Snowden revelations .\nThe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ willing to discuss the Snowden-NSA story on social media than they were in person.\n\u201d Social media was not an outlet for those concerned about expressing an unpopular view .\nConsistent with the \u201c spiral of silence \u201d theory and compatible with Bradbury \u2019 s dystopian future , no matter what the setting , people are reluctant to share an unpopular view .\nA 2020 Cato survey found 62 % \u201c of Americans say the political climate these days prevents them from saying things they believe because others might find them offensive.\n\u201d @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their neighbors and colleagues about Covid-19 policies for fear of being accused of not valuing human lives ?\nIn Fahrenheit 451 , silence helped pave the way for the public \u2019 s embrace of tyranny .\nIn 2020 , Fahrenheit 451 is far more than a chilling , cautionary tale .\nTo reverse the spiral of silence we must make space for candid conversations by thoughtfully considering alternative viewpoints .\nBarry Brownstein is professor emeritus of economics and leadership at the University of Baltimore .\nHe is senior contributor at Intellectual Takeout and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nSubscribe to

time to examine the narratives that are being crafted .\nThis article is part 2 in a series which I started in December 2016 , just weeks after Donald Trump was elected President of the United States .\nIn that piece , I argued that a psychological operation was beginning to take shape involving Trump , the emerging fake news meme , and the fear of Russia interference in American politics .\nThe goal of the operation , I wrote , was \u201c to further @ @ @ @ @ @ @ establishment-worshiping minions , and principled , critically thinking truth seekers.\n\u201d Unfortunately , my forecasting has largely held true , with the American public apparently more divided than ever .\nAdditionally , the independent media has all but been squashed after four years of falsely being labeled Russian stooges or useful idiots .\nHowever , as we near election 2020 , it \u2019 s even more necessary than in 2016 to step back and analyze the plans of the Predator Class .\nLet \u2019 s take a look at the pieces of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for $ 1 per month at Patreon .\nObviously , when I wrote part 1 of this series I had no idea that something called SARS-Cov2 would play such a monumental role in shaping the collective reality of the entire planet .\nDespite my failure to foresee the COVID-19 operation , my predictions have , sadly , largely come true .\nOver the last 9 months , the team at TLAV has produced dozens of written investigations and video reports documenting the lies and fabrications associated with the spread of COVID-19 .\nDuring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exposed how the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation and other connected organizations are steering the fight against COVID-19 .\nAs part of her Engineering Contagion series , Whitney Webb examined the various individuals and institutions which have been conducting exercises on the spread of viral pathogens over the last two decades and how they plan to unleash an all pervasive biosecurity state .\nRyan Cristi\u00e1n has relentlessly produced video reports detailing the limitations of masks in preventing the spread of pathogens , the false positives associated with the PCR test , the lack @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the rise of authoritarian tactics by police and governments around the world .\nAs I wrote in part 2 of my investigation on Parasite Stress Theory , \u201c The authoritarian measures have now grown to include the following : \u2013 contact tracing apps cataloging all your movements and contacts \u2013 talk of mandatory vaccines ( or making it difficult to live without vaccination ) \u2013 raiding of businesses for not closing \u2013 arrests of people violating lockdown ( and this , and this ) \u2013 roving cops searching for people not in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have only accelerated as the so-called \u201c new normal \u201d drags on for the 9th month .\nDespite the numerous holes in the \u201c COVID-19 is the most dangerous thing ever \u201d narrative , governments around the world are currently discussing shutting down their nations and economies in preparation for an alleged \u201c second wave \u201d of COVID-19 infections .\nI have also previously reported on the two fictional scenarios organized by the Gates Foundation and the Rockefeller Foundation , which eerily describe a vision which reflects much of what we are seeing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nI wrote : The Gates Foundation \u2019 s partners in \u201c philanthropy \u201d \u2013 the Rockefeller Foundation \u2013 imagined a similar scenario as part of their 2010 document , \u201c Scenarios for the Future of Technology and International Development.\n\u201d This document includes a scenario called \u201c Lock Step , \u201d which describes a pandemic sweeping the world and resulting in more authoritarian control from governments in developed countries .\nInterestingly , Lock Step notes that while the \u201c pandemic blanketed the planet \u201d the countries which took a more aggressive , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Chinese government \u2019 s quick imposition and enforcement of mandatory quarantine for all citizens , as well as its instant and near-hermetic sealing off of all borders , saved millions of lives , stopping the spread of the virus far earlier than in other countries and enabling a swifter postpandemic recovery , \u201d the document states .\nThe document describes how national leaders around the world \u201c flexed their authority and imposed airtight rules and restrictions.\n\u201d These included mandatory wearing of face masks and body-temperature checks at train stations and markets , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ functional magnetic resonance imaging ( fMRI ) technology\u2026 to detect abnormal behavior that may indicate \u2018 antisocial intent.\n\u2019 \u201d Lock Step also describes the implementation of biometric ID for all people .\nNotably , the paper states , \u201c Even after the pandemic faded , this more authoritarian control and oversight of citizens and their activities stuck and even intensified.\n\u201d Finally , I have exposed the reality of Parasite Stress Theory and the empirical evidence which shows that populations become more obedient , accepting of authoritarian measures , and prefer conformity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their lives are under threat of a deadly pathogen , such as a virus .\nIt is abundantly clear , to those who are rigorously poring over the data , that COVID-19 is not the danger we have been sold .\nIn late September , the US CDC even admitted the death rate is below 1 percent .\nUnfortunately , rather than taking this knowledge and reporting it as a positive development , the corporate media has either ignored these stories or demonized them as \u201c anti-science \u201d conspiracy theories .\nThis begs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all this leading ?\nBottom Line : The corporate media , captured science , and corrupt governments have used the COVID-19 operation as cover for expanding police state and surveillance tactics .\nThroughout this year we have seen populations of whole nations submit and acquiesce to whatever insane mandates the health authorities and politicians demand .\nCivil Unrest , Election 2020 , The Second Wave , and The Darkest Winter Four years ago I wrote that I believed , \u201c Trump is a part of the program .\nHe is keeping the people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fights about the veracity of their news , and the government searches for ways to begin regulating independent journalism while pretending to care about truth.\n\u201d I stand by this claim .\nFour years of the Trump administration has shown that \u2013 while he may occasionally play the role of the wild card \u2013 Donald Trump is most certainly playing a role in the Establishment \u2019 s plan .\nWhat is that plan ?\nTo divide the people so they may conquer the people .\nIn part 1 of this series I wrote @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u201c keeping the domestic front as divided as possible while selling the brainwashed masses into another war \u201d \u2013 meant a proxy war with Russia or Iran .\nWhile these battles are still being waged , I now see that the goal is to keep the domestic front as divided as possible while selling the propagandized masses into an engineered civil war .\nNot only has the corporate media been floating the idea of a civil war since the beginning of the Trump administration , but now Americans are literally killing each other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Trump is doing a grand job of playing the role of The Great Divider .\nTrump acts like a buffoon and says the kind of outrageous things you would expect to hear from a former WWE wrestler .\nThe media reacts to Trump and his increasingly authoritarian measures and makes sure their bias is as obvious as possible .\nThe Trump supporters and anti-left wing activists respond to the bias with the assumption that the media \u2019 s hatred for Trump must be an indication he is on \u201c our side.\n\u201d The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vile the media , and the more divided the streets become .\nHowever , it is important for readers to understand that Trump is not an exception to the presidency .\nHe is simply the ugly , cold hard truth finally revealed for the masses to see .\nUnless you are a blind Trump worshiping cult member who is unwilling to admit his flaws , it is clear to see Trump has continued the trends advanced by previous Presidents Obama , George W. Bush , Bill Clinton , and so on .\nWhile @ @ @ @ @ @ @ black man who possessed the ability to speak with forked tongue and convince the anti-war left that drone bombs are not war , Donald Trump has ripped the false air of legitimacy and the pretense of civility from the American presidency .\nAgain , he may be unpredictable ( or even entertaining ) from time to time , but he is as much of a threat to liberty as the previous presidents .\nThroughout the last four years , Donald Trump has consistently played the role of the divider rather than attempting to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ belief in individual liberty .\nOf course , Trump can not be blamed solely for the growing movement against police violence and subsequent protests and riots .\nHe is simply playing his role , while corporate media and , yes , organizations with ties to George Soros attempt to influence and direct the movements of people who are beginning to question state violence .\nThese converging forces \u2013 with Donald Trump stoking the flames of division at every turn and a potential \u201c color revolution in the U.S. \u2013 are setting the stage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ U.S presidential election on November 3rd , 2020 .\nWhich leads us to a number of recent simulations of the 2020 U.S. election which have resulted in chaos and potential civil war .\nIt would be easy to dismiss these exercises as politically driven fantasy if the people involved had not already publicly advised their candidate not to concede the election under any circumstances .\nMost recently , media reports indicated the Transition Integrity Project ( TIP ) held a number of exercises simulating what might happen in the event Donald Trump loses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leave office .\nThe TIP itself is a secretive group made up of \u201c Never Trump \u201d neocon Republicans and Democrats associated with the Obama administration and Hillary Clinton .\nThe Boston Globe reported that the TIP met in June to simulate the 11-week period between Election Day on November 3rd and Inauguration Day on January 20 , 2021 .\nThe exercises state that \u201c Trump and his Republican allies used every apparatus of government \u2014 the Postal Service , state lawmakers , the Justice Department , federal agents , and the military @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Democrats took to the courts and the streets to try to stop it.\n\u201d The TIP envisioned one scenario where Trump wins and Biden refuses to concede and instead asks for a recount and makes several demands , including to give statehood to Washington , DC and Puerto Rico , and divide California into 5 states .\nIn the exercises Joe Biden is played by John Podesta , Hillary Clinton \u2019 s 2016 campaign manager and chief of staff to former President Bill Clinton .\nThe simulations essentially end in a constitutional crisis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Supreme Court or possibly the military play a deciding role .\nThis unprecedented event could be disastrous for American life as it is likely activists from both sides of the vote would take to the streets to protest what they believe is a theft by their opponents .\nIf you think protests and fights between extreme leftists and extreme right wingers are contentious , just wait until they both feel shafted during the presidential election .\nThose opposed to Trump will claim Biden won and Trump is attempting to steal the election @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Trump supporters will say the Satanic Radical Leftist Democrats are attempting a coup to establish a Communist Police State .\nThe result will be neighbor turning against neighbor , family members disowning one another , and some political activists may escalate their tactics from protests to violence .\nFor more information on the TIP simulation please read Whitney Webb \u2019 s fantastic piece , \u201c Bipartisan \u201d Washington Insiders Reveal Their Plan for Chaos if Trump Wins the Election .\nWebb details other relevant simulations of the 2020 election : Operation Blackout involved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the U.S. , crashing into voters waiting in line at polling stations , hacked traffic lights causing accidents , and the release of \u201c deepfakes \u201d to manipulate the public .\nThe simulation resulted in the cancellation of the 2020 election and the imposition of Martial Law .\nWhile these exercises have simulated the potential for a contested election between Donald Trump and Joe Biden and the likely chaos that will follow , it is also necessary to understand a simulation which happened nearly two decades ago and what role it may play @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dark Winter exercise took place in June 2001 , only months before the 9/11 attacks .\nThis exercise took place at Andrews Air Force Base in Camp Springs , Maryland , and involved several Congressmen , a former CIA director , a former FBI director , government insiders and privileged members of the press .\nThe exercise simulated the use of smallpox as a biological weapon against the American public .\nThe Dark Winter script also discusses how options for martial rule \u201c include , but are not limited to , prohibition of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quarantine of certain areas , suspension of the writ of habeas corpus [ i.e .\narrest without due process ] , and/or military trials in the event that the court system becomes dysfunctional.\n\u201d The full context of the exercise can be understood by reading Whitney Webb \u2019 s piece , but what is important to know is Dark Winter was largely written by Tara O \u2019 Toole , Thomas Inglesby , and Randall Larsen .\nAs Webb has illustrated , these three people were directly involved in the response to the alleged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ days after September 11 , 2001 .\nThese individuals personally briefed Vice President Cheney on Dark Winter .\nCoincidentally , these individuals were also involved in the Event 201 exercise in October 2019 , and in a less well-known exercise in 2018 .\nEvent 201 was co-hosted by the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security , which is currently led by Dark Winter co-author Thomas Inglesby .\nAs part of the 2018 Crimson Contagion exercise , O \u2019 Toole and Inglesby examined how a bioterror attack could trigger the first stages of martial @ @ @ @ @ @ @ final note on Dark Winter is related to the media \u2019 s promotion of a potential \u201c second wave \u201d of COVID-19 hitting the United States if mask mandates , social distancing , and lockdowns are not followed .\nBill Gates and other influential pundits and health authorities warned about a second wave which might arrive in the fall of 2020 .\nWell , here we are , and reports are beginning to come in that \u201c cases are on the rise \u201d , mostly in Europe for the moment .\nThis is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , former director of Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority , all the more concerning .\nBright was recently celebrated as a whistleblower who attempted to hold the Trump administration accountable during the COVID-19 battle .\nHowever , while speaking in front of Congress , Bright stated , \u201c without clear planning and implementation of the steps that I and other experts have outlined , 2020 will be darkest winter in modern history.\n\u201d Now , maybe Bright is simply a concerned scientist warning about the potential for more sick people , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ winter \u201d is hard to ignore .\nWith the knowledge of the TIP simulation , the Cyberreason simulation , the Crimson Contagion simulation , and the Dark Winter exercise , we should be cautious regarding narratives that are spun in the coming final weeks before the presidential election .\nWith the connections between the individuals associated with these exercises and those involved in the fight against COVID-19 , we should also be prepared in the event the predicted chaos comes to fruition .\nThink back to how the Rockefeller \u2019 s Lock Step @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that Americans are initially accepting of the authoritarian lockdown measures , it goes on to describe how , eventually , the people of the world tire of the control and civil unrest would begin : While it might be convenient to dismiss Lock Step ( and all the other exercises ) as a coincidence , it would be short-sighted to ignore them considering the Gates and Rockefeller Foundations are heavily involved in funding the global health industry .\nThese exercises are predicting chaos in response to pandemics and election night civil unrest .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ their role to push the American people to pick a side .\nMeanwhile , my predictions regarding the attacks on independent media have also come to fruition .\nFour years ago I wrote , \u201c If Trump is the establishment \u2019 s wolf in sheep \u2019 s clothing , the Fake News meme is the establishment \u2019 s tool for distraction and division.\n\u201d Over the last four years the fake news label has been used to shadow ban , delete , and censor content creators and journalists .\nTrump plays his role @ @ @ @ @ @ @ censorship \u2013 in reality he is fine with authoritarianism as long as it is his side in control \u2013 and \u201c this feeds back into the love/hate Trump loop , further dividing Americans.\n\u201d Quite simply , \u201c those who hate Trump feel justified in their discontent and are happy to buy media lies about Russian interference in the election and fake news spread by uneducated Trump supporters .\nOn the other side of the fence , Trump supporters feel justified in their distaste for the corporate media and their apparent \u2018 anti-Trump @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on Trump and repetition of unconfirmed rumors from unnamed government sources fuels the anti-establishment mood of the pro-Trump camp.\n\u201d Bottom Line : Donald Trump has successfully played the role of the Great Divider and is doing his job to foment chaos and uncertainty surrounding election 2020 .\nThe Establishment is also preparing for the possibility of Martial Law in response to this chaos and uncertainty .\nMeanwhile , the public is being prepped for a second wave of COVID-19 infections which could lead to the foreshadowed Darkest Winter .\nWe don \u2019 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do encourage everyone to heed these warnings and be prepared for unrest in the days and weeks following the election .\nA global pandemic wreaking havoc on the world \u2019 s economic , political and social systems .\nCivil unrest brewing in response to police violence and unconstitutional lockdowns .\nHundreds of millions of jobs lost around the world .\nA rise in physical violence between opposing political groups .\nA contested election during the most contentious time in recent history .\nWhere exactly are we headed ?\nAs I recently outlined , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ known as \u201c The Great Reset \u201d and was announced in early June by the World Economic Forum .\nThe WEF was involved in the aforementioned Event 201 , in partnership with the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation and the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security .\nThe launch of The Great Reset was supported by Klaus Schwab , the founder and executive chairman of the World Economic Forum ; England \u2019 s Prince Charles ; Antonio Guterres , Secretary-General of the UN ; and Kristalina Georgieva of the International Monetary Fund .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the participation of Ma Jun , the chairman of the Green Finance Committee at the China Society for Finance and Banking and a member of the Monetary Policy Committee of the People \u2019 s Bank of China .\nThe event was also supported by Bernard Looney , CEO of BP ; Ajay Banga , CEO of Mastercard ; and Bradford Smith , president of Microsoft .\nIn an opinion piece published in The Globe and Mail , Klaus Schwab provided more details on the goals of The Great Reset ( emphasis added @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Schwab and his ilk is a top-down centralized world run by technocrats who manage the world \u2019 s resources and people in the name of saving the planet .\nAs TLAV \u2019 s has previously documented , the WEF operates in a similar fashion to the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation : their publicly stated goals mask a global control agenda .\nThus , it should come as no surprise that Klaus Schwab , founder of the WEF , is a former attendee and member of the Steering Committee for the secretive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ akin to a more public Bilderberg Group which brings together around 3,000 business leaders , international political leaders , economists , celebrities , and journalists for a five day conference to discuss global issues .\nThe WEF meets every January in Davos , Switzerland , to discuss their agenda .\nThe elitism of the WEF has resulted in Schwab and his cohorts being nicknamed The Davos Class .\nIn January 2021 the theme of the WEF meeting will be \u201c The Great Reset.\n\u201d It \u2019 s important that we keep an eye @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Great Reset as we draw closer to election 2020 and a potential Dark Winter .\nKlaus Schwab , Bill Gates , and their associates are determined to present themselves as the saviors of humanity .\nThey are using the COVID-19 panic as an opportunity to push their agenda while selling it as the cure to our problems .\nAs every student of power and deception knows , the easiest way to achieve victory over your opponent is to guide them to a predetermined destination which benefits your agenda .\nIf you can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they are consciously making their own choices and the path is for their own good \u2013 well , you are all but guaranteed success .\nI believe the evidence indicates this is the strategy we are seeing unfold during the COVID-19 operation and upcoming 2020 election .\nBottom Line : The Predator Class attempts to mask their true intentions with flowery language designed to lull the waking masses back to sleep .\nIt is true that our world is existing in an unsustainable paradigm .\nWe do have growing income inequality , police @ @ @ @ @ @ @ insufficient food production systems .\nThese problems were apparent before COVID-19 and the fragility of these systems has indeed become more obvious in recent months .\nHowever , these psychopaths would prefer if we allowed them to stay in the driver \u2019 s seat as they careen us into a future of technocratic control and the end of individual liberty .\nWe must reject their version of the Great Reset and use the momentum and desire for change to create a world that respects individual liberty .\nIn conclusion , I believe we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to inform our friends and family , and motivate them to prepare for what may be on the horizon .\nWe can spend our time attempting to convince them of the lies of COVID-19 .\nWe can also try to educate them about the numerous exercises predicting chaos and civil unrest across the United States .\nAs important as education is in the Information War ; now might be the time to focus our energy on helping our families be prepared for what may come .\nRather than attempting to convince them to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you believe , perhaps we can simply help keep them safe until they can clearly see the writing on the wall .\nI want to reiterate that I do not write these words in hopes of inspiring fear or stress .\nIn fact , I hope that this analysis can paint a clear enough picture of the grim reality we are facing so we may act !\nIt is only by honestly facing our circumstances that we can hope to influence and change the path of humanity .\nThis is a historic time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ opportunity to play a powerful role .\nIt \u2019 s time to shake off the shackles and expose those who seek to hold us back for their own sick purposes .\nVisit TheLastAmericanVagabond.com .\nSubscribe to TLAV \u2019 s independent news

"2020-10-01", "source": "activistpost", "title": "Rising Homicides This Year May Be Yet Another Side Effect of Covid Lockdowns", "content": "During Tuesday \u2019 s presidential debate , former vice-president Biden attempted to paint Donald Trump as the bad-on-crime candidate when he claimed that crime had gone done down during the Obama administration , but increased during Trump \u2019 s term .\nWhether or not this is a plausible claim depends on how one looks at the data .\nAnd given that law enforcement and criminal prosecutions for street crime are generally a state and local matter , it \u2019 s unclear why any president ought to be awarded blame or plaudits for short-term trends that occur during his administration .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ like homicides\u2014which tend to be a good indicator of crime trends over all\u2014are indeed rising this year .\nWhile many factors are likely at play , we may be seeing yet another side effect of the stay-at-home orders and resulting social fragmentation that have come to be part of the landscape of 2020 .\nAs workplaces were closed down , joblessness rose , and community organizations were shuttered , city and state governments may have been paving the way for more social conflict and crime .\nIn assessing the larger context , we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new report released by the FBI on 2019 \u2019 s crime and homicides , and we have partial data from 2020 as well .\nThere is no doubt that 2019 \u2019 s homicides were up slightly from where they were six years earlier .\nBack in 2014 , homicides in the United States hit a 51-year low , falling to 4.4 victims per 100,000 residents .\nThat is , homicides that year fell to the lowest rate seen since the post-war days when homicides were exceptionally low , and at some of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nSince then , homicide rates have risen , but have remained well below the high rates the nation experienced from the 1970s into the 1990s .\nNationwide , from 2018 to 2019 , the homicide rate remained unchanged at 5.0 victims per 100,000 population .\n( That \u2019 s only about half the size of the homicide rates we saw during the late seventies and early nineties when homicides hovered around 10 per 100,000 . )\nBut homicides have certainly not been evenly distributed .\nTotal homicides in recent years were largely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ small number of big cities like Baltimore , Memphis , and Chicago .\nNonetheless , homicide rates did increase from 2018 to 2019 in 24 states .\nStatewide homicide rates were unchanged in 7 states , and rates fell in 19 states .\nAs we \u2019 ve seen in similar analyses in the past , New England , the Pacific Northwest , and northern parts of the Midwest tend to report the lowest homicide rates .\nIn 2019 , the lowest homicide rates were found in Maine , Vermont , South Dakota , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ found in Louisiana , Mississippi , and Alaska .\nWhat Is the Trend in 2020 ?\nWhen we begin to look at what data we have for 2020 , it looks like the trend is upward .\nAccording to the Wall Street Journal the nation \u2019 s largest cities are seeing a lot more homicide in 2020 than in recent years : A sharp rise in homicides this year is hitting large U.S. cities across the country , signaling a new public-safety risk unleashed during the coronavirus pandemic , and amid recession and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A Wall Street Journal analysis of crime statistics among the nation \u2019 s 50 largest cities found that reported homicides were up 24 % so far this year , to 3,612 .\nShootings and gun violence also rose , even though many other violent crimes such as robbery fell .\nSome cities with long-running crime problems saw their numbers rise , including Philadelphia , Detroit and Memphis , Tenn. Chicago , the worst-hit , has tallied more than one of every eight homicides .\nLess-violent places have been struck as well , such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nIn all , 36 of the 50 cities studied saw homicide rise at double-digit rates , representing all regions of the country .\nAmong these cities , perhaps the most discussed is Chicago which has indeed shown a sizable increase in 2020 over the previous year .\nAccording to The Atlantic , a look at recent homicide data \u201c shows this year \u2019 s rate ( the red line ) rising above the five-year baseline ( the gray line and shading ) at several points throughout the year.\n\u201d Note that homicides @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the lockdowns , but before the riots and protests .\nTrends similar to Chicago \u2019 s don \u2019 t show up in all other cities .\nBut the general trend in big cities is clear .\nBut what is the cause ?\nWhen it comes to homicide trends , it \u2019 s nearly impossible to prove any one thing is responsible .\nCriminologists and historians have been debating what drives homicide trends for more than a century .\nBut given that 2019 was so relatively uneventful in terms of homicide growth , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , business closures , and church closures have played no role at all in rising homicides .\nYes , other factors are also at work .\nThe unemployment resulting from business closures\u2014not wholly attributable to forced lockdowns\u2014is likely a factor .\nIt is also likely that the civil unrest connected to anti-police protests and riots have played a part .\nAs suggested in the research of criminologist Randolph Roth , homicides tend to increase as perceptions of the state \u2019 s legitimacy go into decline .\nHowever , as the Wall Street Journal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ safe have been destabilized by lockdown and protests against police .\nLockdowns and recession also mean tensions are running high and streets have been emptied of eyes and ears on their communities .\nSome attribute the rise to an increase in gang violence .\nHomicides \u2026 are up because violent criminals have been emboldened by the sidelining of police , courts , schools , churches and an array of other social institutions by the reckoning with police and the pandemic , say analysts and law-enforcement officials in several cities .\nSchools let out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pandemic and after-school activities largely stopped .\nChurches and other social institutions were restrained for the sake of social distancing .\n\u201c Gangs are built around structure and lack thereof , \u201d said Jeff La Blue , a spokesman for the Fresno police department .\n\u201c With schools being closed and a lot of different businesses being closed , the people that normally would have been involved in positive structures in their lives aren \u2019 t there.\n\u201d The Atlantic also suggests a role for the pandemic response among other proposed causes such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nWhen it comes to lockdowns as a source of conflict , the problem lies in the fact that governments have forced the closure of the very institutions which do much to defuse violence within communities .\nIndeed , the connection between these social institutions and violence has been suggested for decades by sociologists .\nKnown as \u201c third places , \u201d these institutions play a key told in encouraging peaceful human interactions .\nAs noted by researchers at the Brookings Institutions : Without these institutions , people living on the edges of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and lacking in community support of any kind .\nViolence often follows .\nDuring the worst of the lockdowns , city residents faced closed schools , closed churches , and closed businesses .\nAs the Journal notes , under these conditions , violent gangs may offer a much-needed refuge from government-imposed isolation .\nEven with stay-at-home orders lifted , governments continue to impose restrictions on social institutions like churches and other meeting places and threaten them with police harassment in case of non-compliance .\nYet , these third places can not simply be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the potential for greater conflict and antisocial behavior .\nIt is likely folly to try to pin rising homicides in 2020 on any single cause , but we should not be shocked that a rising homicide rate is accompanying the so-called \u201c new normal.\n\u201d After all , the government-imposed shutdowns have done far more than shut down community organizations .\nThey have thrown millions of Americans out of work\u2014with more than ten million former workers currently collecting unemployment benefits\u2014and have set the stage for a rising tide of evictions and bankruptcies .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ not necessarily come with rising crime .\nBut unemployment rarely helps

Online Content Policy Modernization Act Is an Unconstitutional Mess", "content": "EFF is standing with a huge coalition of organizations to urge Congress to oppose the Online Content Policy Modernization Act ( OCPMA , S. 4632 ) .\nIntroduced by Sen. Lindsey Graham ( R-SC ) , the OCPMA is yet another of this year \u2019 s flood of misguided attacks on Internet speech ( read bill [ pdf ] ) .\nThe bill would make it harder for online platforms to take common-sense moderation measures like removing spam or correcting disinformation , including disinformation about the upcoming election .\nBut it doesn \u2019 t stop there : the bill would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , subjecting ordinary Internet users to up to $ 30,000 in fines for everyday activities like sharing photos and writing online , without even the benefit of a judge and jury .\nThe OCPMA combines two previous bills .\nThe first\u2014the Online Freedom and Viewpoint Diversity Act ( S. 4534 ) \u2014undermines Section 230 , the most important law protecting free speech online .\nSection 230 enshrines the common-sense principle that if you say something unlawful online , you should be the one held responsible , not the website or platform where you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it clear that platforms have liability protections for the decisions they make to moderate or remove online speech : platforms are free to decide their own moderation policies however they see fit .\nThe OCPMA would flip that second protection on its head , shielding only platforms that agree to confine their moderation policies to a narrowly tailored set of rules .\nAs EFF and a coalition of legal experts explained to the Senate Judiciary Committee : This narrowing would create a strong disincentive for companies to take action against a whole host @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where and how to vote , content that aims to intimidate or discourage people from casting a ballot , or misleading information about the integrity of our election systems .\nS.4632 would also create a new risk of liability for services that \u201c editorialize \u201d alongside user-generated content .\nIn other words , sites that direct users to voter-registration pages , that label false information with fact-checks , or that provide accurate information about mail-in voting , would face lawsuits over the user-generated content they were intending to correct .\nIt \u2019 s @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Section 230 provisions in this bill , but they simply don \u2019 t hold up to scrutiny .\nThis bill is based on the flawed premise that social media platforms \u2019 moderation practices are rampant with bias against conservative views ; while a popular meme in some right-wing circles , this view doesn \u2019 t hold water .\nThere are serious problems with platforms \u2019 moderation practices , but the problem isn \u2019 t the liberal silencing the conservative ; the problem is the powerful silencing the powerless .\nBesides , it \u2019 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would somehow be improved by putting such severe limits on how platforms moderate ; the Internet is a better place when multiple moderation philosophies can coexist , some more restrictive and some more freeform .\nThe government forcing platforms to adopt a specific approach to moderation is not just a bad idea ; in fact ; it \u2019 s unconstitutional .\nAs EFF explained in its own letter to the Judiciary Committee : Sen. Graham has also used the OCPMA as his vehicle to bring back the CASE Act , a 2019 bill @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for hearing \u201c small \u201d ( $ 30,000 ! )\ncopyright disputes , putting everyday Internet users at risk of losing everything simply for sharing copyrighted images or text online .\nThis tribunal would exist within the Copyright Office , not the judicial branch , and it would lack important protections like the right to a jury trial and registration requirements .\nAs we explained last year , the CASE Act would usher in a new era of copyright trolling , with copyright owners or their agents sending notices en masse to users @ @ @ @ @ @ @ When Congress was debating the CASE Act last year , its proponents laughed off concerns that the bill would put everyday Internet users at risk , clearly not understanding what a $ 30,000 fee would mean to the average family .\nAs EFF and a host of other copyright experts explained to the Judiciary Committee : The copyright small claims dispute provisions in S. 4632 are based upon S. 1273 , the Copyright Alternative in Small-Claims Enforcement Act of 2019 ( \u201c CASE Act \u201d ) , which could potentially bankrupt millions of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ schools , libraries and religious institutions at a time when more of our lives are taking place online than ever before due to the COVID-19 pandemic .\nLaws that would subject any American organization or individual \u2014 from small businesses to religious institutions to nonprofits to our grandparents and children \u2014 to up to $ 30,000 in damages for something as simple as posting a photo on social media , reposting a meme , or using a photo to promote their nonprofit online are not based on sound policy .\nThe Senate Judiciary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nThis bill is far too much of a mess to be saved by amendments .\nWe urge the Committee to reject it .", "author": "Activist Post", "url":

Upends Vallejo, California\u2019s Use of Stingray Surveillance", "content": "Cops in Vallejo have put their controversial cell-phone surveillance tool back in the box , after a judge released a tentative ruling ( which the judge might or might not later finalize or amend ) that they \u2019 d acquired it in violation of state law .\nThe case was brought by Oakland Privacy , the EFF Pioneer Award Winning organization and Electronic Frontiers Alliance member .\nThey allege that the city of Vallejo , California , may not use its cellular surveillance tool ( often called a cell site simulator or stingray ) because the police failed to get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ following input from residents , of an adequate privacy policy governing its use .\nAccording to the tentative ruling ( again , it is not final ) , police must acquire from Vallejo City council a \u201c resolution or ordinance authorizing a specific usage and privacy policy regarding that technology and meeting the requirements \u201d of the state statute .\nThe City Council assembled via teleconference in spring 2020 , amidst a state-wide pandemic related shelter-in-place order , to vote for the purchase of

policy for this already-purchased machine on the docket for public discussion on October 27 .\nAs Oakland Privacy writes on their blog , \u201c This meeting will provide an opportunity for Vallejo residents to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ policy prior to adoption by the City.\n\u201d We urge members of the public to turn out and voice their concerns about Vallejo police obtaining expensive new surveillance technology that can intrude on privacy , chill free speech , and disparately burden people of color .\nA cell-site simulator pretends to act as a cell tower in order to locate cellular devices that

simulators to locate a known phone in an unknown location ( for example , to find a person wanted on a warrant ) , or to identify the unknown phones in a known location ( for example , to learn the

simulator devices from KeyW Corporation , along with a vehicle in which police would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ simulators are a valuable tool in fighting terrorism and crime\u2013but the truth is police often use them to target low-level infractions .\nFor example , Maryland police deployed a stingray to collect information on the customers of a pizza shop in an attempt to find the thief that absconded with around $ 50 worth of chicken wings and subs .\nWorse , there are serious concerns that police use stingrays to identify people who exercise their First Amendment right to attend political

Second Wave and Holiday Food Shortages", "content": "Just a few days ago , I wrote an article ( The Supply Chain Is Broken and Food Shortages Are HERE ) detailing the disruptions to the US supply chain and explained how food shortages are coming to the United States .\nIn fact , I pointed out how they are already here , but many Americans simply don \u2019 t know it yet .\nAfter all , mainstream media hasn \u2019 t been telling them about the disruptions to the supply chain as a result of COVID lockdowns and questionable strikes nor is it telling them about how many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of wildfires in the west of the country , straight-line winds in the middle , or flooding and hurricanes in the south .\nThe mainstream media says the supply chain is just fine .\nThe mainstream media has been largely silent and has focused more on telling its readers and viewers that the supply chain is just fine .\nThat is , until recently .\nThat \u2019 s why Southeastern Grocers bought its Thanksgiving turkeys and holiday hams over the summer , months before inventory planning normally begins , the company \u2019 s @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Journal .\nAssociated Food Stores started stockpiling cleaning and sanitizing products so it always has inventory in its warehouse , and with cold season around the corner , grocery wholesaler United Natural Foods has already loaded up on herbal tea and cold remedies , the company told the Journal .\nEarly on in the pandemic , grocery stores were focusing on stockpiling weeks of supplies for shoppers , but now food sellers are focusing on the long-term , aiming to stockpile supplies for months instead .\nGrocers have been stocking \u201c Pandemic Pallets @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Grocery stores are stocking pallets with items they fear may run low in the coming months .\nKeeping these pallets stored in the warehouses , most of them are stocked with cleaning items and paper products , cold medicines , dry goods , and food staples like rice , pasta , and legumes \u2013 all the things that they ran out of quickly the last time around .\nAnd , with the holidays right around the corner , many stores are stockpiling holiday foods like cranberry sauce .\n\u201c Pandemic Pallets \u201d are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for worst and stocking the wooden storage structures with items that could be in high demand around Thanksgiving , and even Christmas , according to the Wall Street Journal .\nThe goods being stockpiled on the pallets range from cleaning supplies to dry goods , the report said .\nWhile the pallets vary in nature , their overall purpose remains the same : ensuring grocery stores will be able to handle demand if shoppers begin to \u201c panic buy \u201d as they did in March if COVID-19 cases spike in the winter .\n@ @ @ @ @ @

.\nNevertheless , shortages are still expected @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shortages were also the focus of this article that describes the effect the pandemic has had on meat supplies .\nHere is an excerpt from that article : Why would there be a food shortage during the holidays ?\nWhy would stores face a shortage of when they haven \u2019 t had a shortage in years past ?\nAnd why would they expect it ?\nWhy would that happen on the most socially distanced holiday season in American history ?\nMany people are staying at home and that means more cooking at home @ @ @ @ @ @ @ demand for food products from the grocery stores .\nRegardless of social distancing , people still have to eat .\nMura Dominko of Eat This wrote the article , \u201c Grocery Stores Are Preparing For Shortages Of These Holiday

Scamdemic, Rioting, and Election Cheating to Crush Freedom in Amerika", "content": "Some relatives visited over the weekend , and one of them had said they would not be wearing masks .\nHowever , when they were here , they were wearing masks , citing the news about Trump having COVID .\nThe psy-ops are working .\nIt felt like it was the \u201c Invasion of the Body Snatchers.\n\u201d Oh , well .\nThe \u201c news \u201d is saying that Trump \u2019 s oxygen levels decreased a lot .\nWas he wearing the mask ?\nThat \u2019 s probably why !\nAnd about that Trump COVID illness , people are accusing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Coney Barrett event as \u201c Coronavirus Super-Spreaders.\n\u201d Everyone in the Trump circle is now testing positive for the coronavirus , and several Republican senators ( but not Democrats ) , and how convenient all this just weeks before the election .\nNot at all suspicious , nooooo .\nBecome an Activist Post Patron for $ 1 per month at Patreon .\nLook , because of all the widespread false positive test results , if you get a positive test result , get a second opinion !\nOr better , don \u2019 t @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unreliable .\nIf you receive a \u201c positive \u201d test result you may be ordered into quarantine i.e .\nhouse arrest and further harassed by the COVID stasi .\nSo the political hacks and media personalities won \u2019 t shut up about the Trump \u201c Super-Spreaders , \u201d even though those flunkies said nothing about the maskless rioters and arsonists , a.k.a .\n\u201c peaceful protesters , \u201d and their potential to spread virus .\n( i.e .\nthe hacks and media people are full of sh*t , as they always are .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ promoting risking other people \u2019 s lives in the name of personal gratification is a way of life with the people on the left , such as in Planned Parenthood \u2019 s promotion of HIV-positive people \u2019 s \u201c right \u201d to not inform sexual partners of one \u2019 s HIV-positive status .\nIf it \u2019 s to do with immediate sexual gratification , risking others \u2019 lives is A-OKAY for these pervs !\nAnyway , by March I was speculating that \u201c COVID \u201d was being exaggerated and hyped , and that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a planned agenda as well .\nAnd now CIA asset Bob Woodward \u2019 s revealing that Trump ( rightfully ) \u201c downplayed \u201d the COVID virus , compares to the October 2016 release of the Access Hollywood tape of Trump talking lewdly of women .\nBut there seems to be a wider motive for implementing a virus scamdemic such as wanting to cause fear and cause the masses to want to avoid voting in person .\nWith the 2020 Presidential election there are already widespread examples of attempts at election cheating , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sent to people who didn \u2019 t request them , being sent to people \u2019 s addresses in the names of previous residents and in the names of deceased people , being sent with postage-paid envelopes to send in votes but with no postmark date so poll workers don \u2019 t know if it was postmarked past the deadline , judges legislating extended deadlines past the November 3rd deadline and allowing for mail-in votes to be counted for weeks after the election , so cheaters have time to mark up ballots and/or throw @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out there are drooling to do anything they can to get Trump out of there ( including sticking a contaminated swab up his nostril ? )\n.\nWe know many people hate Trump , because his saying , \u201c Drain The Swamp \u201d meant he wanted to go into Washington and \u201c rock the boat , \u201d and \u201c knock over the table , \u201d and get rid of the corruption .\nNone of which he \u2019 s done , however .\nAnd Trump said , \u201c End the endless wars , \u201d @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nThe warmongers , neocons , military contractors , consultants , media hangers-on , and bureaucracy career parasites want Trump out of there , and the attempted \u201c Russia-Trump collusions \u201d frame-up and impeachment-for-nothing prove it .\nThere are other motives for the scamdemic and for massive election cheating , such as the Marxists who are openly trying to take away freedom in America .\nLook at the college campuses , the bureaucrats , government commissars , the \u201c deep state , \u201d and social agitating devices such as \u201c Black Lives Matter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , violence and arson burning down businesses that are owned by black people and employ black people that \u201c Black Lives Matter \u201d don \u2019 t care about .\nRegarding further evidence of all this being planned , in 2013 there was the Boston Marathon bombing , and later that week the at-large Dzhokhar Tsarnaev co-terrorist bomber was being sought after by many police in the Boston area .\nOn that one dreaded day , the governor imposed a fascist \u201c shelter-in-place \u201d order , and the whole Boston area was a ghost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u201c dry run \u201d for this year \u2019 s fascist lockdowns for 3 months for no good reason .\nA year later in September-November 2014 was the Africa Ebola scare , in which 11 people in the U.S. were confirmed with Ebola , and 2 died .\nBut it didn \u2019 t spread beyond those 11 people , supposedly , and there was no hysteria , no panic .\nAnd no MASKS !\nAnd Ebola has a 90 % death rate , compared to COVID \u2019 s .1 to .2 % death rate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the unnecessary panic and hysteria all this year would have been more appropriate in 2014 , no ?\nAlso in 2014 was the incident of New York City police killing an unarmed black man , Eric Garner , for no reason , because he was selling individual cigarettes .\n( Oooh , selling individual cigarettes ! )\nThe police were choking Garner , and he said , \u201c I can \u2019 t breathe \u201d 11 times before he died .\nWhat a coincidence with what \u2019 s been going on this year , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I can \u2019 t breathe.\n\u201d With the COVID scamdemic some people have been saying , \u201c I can \u2019 t breathe \u201d with these damn masks we \u2019 ve been ordered to wear by fascists , some possible side effects being oxygen deprivation and/or sickness caused by bacteria accumulation in the masks .\nThe masks could cause breathing problems , or exacerbate already existing breathing problems .\nMaking the kids wear the masks , lowering their oxygen intake , is child abuse , in my view .\nEspecially when all this is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ COVID-19 is very similar to that of seasonal flu .\nOne purpose of the masks is for conformity and \u201c helping others , \u201d and this goes with the rioting Marxists \u2019 theme of self-sacrifice for the \u201c common good , \u201d because with COVID everyone is assumed to be a \u201c carrier , \u201d and we must \u201c protect others \u201d by wearing a useless , ineffective mask .\nLike the house arrest lockdowns and being a hermit to \u201c protect others.\n\u201d The masks also reinforce submission , and suppression of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the official narrative , dissent from the mainstream consensus that declares \u201c Science !\n\u201d but is actually anti-science .\nAnd now we have police thugs arresting innocent people for not wearing masks , that is , police not wearing masks arresting people for not wearing masks !\nWacko governors ordering churches closed , arresting disobedient worshipers .\nSo these anti-religion policies are a warning , because those Christian-hating Marxists really are out there .\nThe contact tracing stuff seems to be for ulterior purposes as well .\nTotalitarian zealots want to know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people are going in their private lives , etc .\n( Don \u2019 t give \u201c contact tracers \u201d ANY information .\nIt \u2019 s none of their damn business ! )\nAnd the riots , the looting and arson .\nMayors and police chiefs ordering police to stand down , as they \u201c stand with the protesters , \u201d who are supposedly \u201c peacefully protesting \u201d in their violent rioting , looting and burning down businesses , churches , libraries and other structures .\nPolice not arresting thugs and criminals .\nBLM @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bail money for violent criminals to be let right back out on the streets .\nKamala Harris saying she supports them and the \u201c protests , \u201d i.e .\nviolence , that will not stop and it \u201c should not stop.\n\u201d These Marxists and communists are stark raving mad !\nIn one recent situation , 2 police were shot in L.A. and while they waited to be helped by ambulance there were people around who wouldn \u2019 t help them , who were laughing at them and taunting them .\nThen while @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there were those people outside the hospital actually blocking the entrance to prevent people from coming or going , and shouting , \u201c We hope they die.\n\u201d What kind of people are these ?\nSo because of being brainwashed , the \u201c protesters \u201d take isolated incidents such as George Floyd and Breonna Taylor and blame ALL cops for those incidents .\nThat \u2019 s like blaming all white people for slavery that ended 150 years ago , or blaming all black people because of black shootings in Chicago .\nAiding and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ country have been declining to arrest or press charges against shoplifters , burglars , home-invaders , assaulters , spouse-abusers , and others .\nThere must be some kind of organized , planned agenda going on here , it \u2019 s very sinister .\nAnd also we have seen mobs of angry \u201c protesters \u201d ganging up on restaurant patrons outside and harassing them and terrorizing them .\nWhat kind of people do this sort of thing ?\nGanging up on innocent people .\nAnd going into neighborhoods and threatening residents to burn down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u201c owe \u201d those mobs their homes ?\nAnd going into the neighborhoods at all hours of the night and waking people up , the mobs have no idea who those people are .\nIt \u2019 s like , \u201c Excuse me , mobs , who the hell would want to help someone like YOU ?\n!\n\u201d And this has nothing to do with race , or \u201c black \u201d anything , because many of the rioters and mobs are white !\nThey are not \u201c white supremacists , \u201d another lie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people are brainwashed , privileged little leftist snowflakes from wealthy families who spend too much time on their video games and social media .\nAnd the election cheating , with brainwashed zealous activists really believing that they can bend the rules when the outcome is on the one hand getting rid of Donald Trump at all cost , and on the other hand causing widespread chaos , confusion and societal upheaval , because the brainwashed really believe that the ultimate outcome is their \u201c socialist \u201d i.e .\nMarxist communist paradise utopia they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fanatics of their government schools .\nThe COVID pushers and rioters and ignorant media propagandists really want to eliminate capitalism and private property , crush individualism and take away our freedom .\nThey \u2019 re not kidding !\nSuch racial collectivism is now coinciding with the COVID collectivism of mask-wearing mandates supported by fascists like Joe Biden , and other pointless collectivist measures whose real purpose is to impose an authoritarian rule of conformity and suppression of dissent .\nAnd some people are saying that all this is only going to get worse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reverse this ?\nScott Lazarowitz is a libertarian writer and commentator .\nPlease visit his blog .\nSubscribe to Activist Post for truth , peace ,

, gas , and water .\nMillions have been installed in the U.S. \u2013 including by First Energy in Ohio \u2013 and millions more are planned despite all their problems including cybersecurity risks (

dangerous , and unnecessary \u201c Smart Meters \u201d .\nFor now , at least advocates are focusing on how to prevent other utility injustices .\nWhat can be done to reduce influence of dark money on Ohio energy policy ?\nAny changes in the wake of the alleged $ 60 million @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , advocates say .\nThis article provided by Eye on Ohio , the nonprofit , nonpartisan Ohio Center for Journalism in partnership with the nonprofit Energy News Network .\nPlease join our free mailing list or the mailing list for the Energy New Network as this helps us provide more public service reporting .\nThe arrest of former Ohio House Speaker Larry Householder and others in July revealed how the use of dark money organizations enabled an alleged $ 60 million conspiracy to sway elections and provide costly bailouts to noncompetitive nuclear and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ court cases move forward , questions remain about what can be done to restore confidence in the legislature and to prevent similar situations in the future .\n\u201c Dark money is really how special interests win right now , \u201d said Jay Costa , executive director at Voters \u2019 Right To Know .\nWhen corporations use shell groups to hide their political spending , they \u201c gain a level of credibility they wouldn \u2019 t otherwise have , \u201d he explained .\n\u201c I like to think of it as the \u2018 Wizard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ words , voters don \u2019 t get to see who \u2019 s behind the curtain .\nTwo months after the federal government \u2019 s criminal complaint and indictment in July , Ohio Attorney General David Yost has filed a state court lawsuit .\nThe complaint alleges a \u201c pattern of corrupt activity , \u201d and seeks injunctive relief to prevent FirstEnergy , FirstEnergy Solutions , Energy Harbor and others from reaping benefits from the bailouts under House Bill 6 .\nA hearing on a preliminary motion for that relief is currently scheduled for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it \u2019 s unclear whether Ohio lawmakers will actually repeal House Bill 6 , the bailout law passed as a result of the alleged conspiracy .\nBoth Democratic and Republican lawmakers called for a swift repeal in late July and early August .\nHowever , leadership in the Ohio House has so far refused to allow a full House vote on any pending repeal bills .\n\u201c They \u2019 re just dragging their feet , \u201d said Rep. David Leland , D-Columbus .\n\u201c We have 58 members of the legislature who are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u201d Instead , Speaker Robert Cupp , R-Lima , has referred the bill to a House Select Committee on Energy Policy and Oversight .\nSo far , those hearings have largely been a general review of the pros and cons of HB 6 , rather than a focused oversight of the alleged corruption that led to its passage and whether it should be repealed in order to repair any claimed harm to public trust in the legislature \u2019 s integrity .\n\u201c The only way that we can prove that Ohio is not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , \u201d Leland said .\n\u201c The polling we \u2019 ve seen shows that people by an overwhelming margin are going to punish those people who have voted for HB 6 and have done nothing to repeal it.\n\u201d Early and absentee voting in Ohio begins on Oct. 6 .\n\u201c Our legislators are supposed to act in the public interest , \u201d said political scientist Leah Stokes at the University of California at Santa Barbara .\nCorporations \u2019 interests may sometimes conflict .\nBut , she adds , \u201c it \u2019 s @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not to be listening to those special interests .\nThat basic responsibility of democracy has failed in Ohio with House Bill 6.\n\u201d A straight repeal would mostly restore Ohio energy law to before HB 6 became effective , subject to some follow-up regulatory matters before the Public Utilities Commission of Ohio .\nA quick replacement could potentially reenact all or much of the law , which also gutted the state \u2019 s clean energy standards .\nAdvocates say that rushing to ram through anything more than a simple repeal this year would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more problems , even aside the alleged conspiracy \u2019 s past influence on the current makeup of the Ohio House of Representatives .\nEven at that , a repeal bill would now need either an emergency clause or an injunction sought by the state attorney general in order to stop the nuclear subsidies slated to start in January .\nThe committee adjourned on Sept. 30 and no additional meetings are currently scheduled .\nHB 6 \u201c is so questionable at this moment .\nThe vehicle itself and the way it was sold is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u201d said Rachael Belz , executive director of Ohio Citizen Action .\n\u201c We need them to repeal it , and then we need to go from there.\n\u201d And that second step will take time , she said .\n\u201c It \u2019 s complicated and complex legislation and policy .\nAnd we have to get it right , \u201d said Chris Neme , a principal and co-founder of Energy Futures Group .\n\u201c Passing a bill in less than a couple of months like the way HB 6 was just leads us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The bigger question is how to prevent similar abuses in the future .\nUtilities and fossil fuel interests have given heavily to Ohio political campaigns since the state enacted a 1999 law calling for competition in electricity generation .\nAnd the level of giving went up dramatically once a competitive market actually began to develop in the state .\nUtilities \u2019 political spending has continued during this election season .\nFirstEnergy spokesperson Jennifer Young said that its political action committee has since canceled campaign donations it had originally reported as going out in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nCampaign donations shown for August have in fact been sent out , Young said .\nFirstEnergy has denied any wrongdoing in connection with its political donations or the alleged Householder scandal .\nMeanwhile , a 2010 Supreme Court case , Citizens United , \u201c really opened up the floodgates of fossil fuel and electric utility influence over politics , \u201d Stokes said .\nUtilities \u2019 political spending is \u201c particularly pernicious , \u201d in her view , because customers \u201c have to buy from these companies \u201d to get electricity delivered to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , reporting requirements currently apply only to immediate spenders on political issues and campaigns .\nThey don \u2019 t reach all the way up the chain to the original source of the money .\n\u201c It \u2019 s basically this Russian nesting doll scenario , where you have one donor giving to another donor , giving to another donor , to get to the person who finally spends the money to influence the voters , \u201d Costa explained .\nIn the case of HB 6 , money flowed into Generation Now from multiple @ @ @ @ @ @ @ share allegedly originating with Company A \u2014 understood to be FirstEnergy \u2014 and its subsidiaries , according to the federal complaint .\nSome of the money in turn then went to a political action committee .\nOr , it went to other organizations that directly funded pro-HB 6 ads .\nOne such ad claimed a debunked Chinese conspiracy was behind last year \u2019 s failed effort to put a referendum on the law on the ballot this fall .\nA for-profit group called Ohioans for Energy Security paid for that ad .\nWhen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ firm that set up the corporation , Isaac Wiles , would not answer questions about the source of its funding .\n\u201c The notion that dark money is something some people don \u2019 t like is not part of the elements of the crime , \u201d Mark Weaver , an attorney at that firm , said at a Columbus Metropolitan Club forum after news broke about the Householder arrest .\nAsked if there was too much money sloshing around at the statehouse , he said it \u2019 s \u201c a lot of money @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pales in comparison \u201d to the amount that Americans spend on Halloween candy and costumes every year .\nAnd he claimed that the First Amendment protects the right to conduct political speech anonymously .\nHe quoted from a 1995 case .\n\u201c Of course , state and local governments may ( depending on how they draft ) pass additional 501 ( c ) 4 disclosure requirements that could meet constitutional scrutiny , \u201d Weaver later added .\nThe 1995 case distinguished earlier cases requiring disclosure for corporate spending .\nThe Supreme Court \u2019 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u201c prompt disclosure of expenditures can provide shareholders and citizens with the information needed to hold corporations and elected officials accountable for their positions and supporters.\n\u201d \u201c There is no absolute right to anonymous speech , \u201d said attorney Ian Vandewalker at the Brennan Center for Justice at New York University School of Law .\nElections are treated differently from general speech , because of the overriding interest in making sure elections function properly , he explained at a panel organized by the League of Women Voters of Ohio .\n\u201c That @ @ @ @ @ @ @ policies to not be able to cheat the public , \u201d Vandewalker said .\n\u201c And so those interests require that there be a level of transparency.\n\u201d \u201c No regulation , no law , no set of ethical rules substitutes for American voters paying attention to who \u2019 s running for office \u2014 pressing them hard on what they stand for , looking closely at the issues , and going into the ballot box having done your homework , \u201d Weaver said .\n\u201c The reason that information is important and transparency @ @ @ @ @ @ @ educated , \u201d said Catherine Turcer , executive director of Common Cause Ohio .\n\u201c You can \u2019 t make the argument that voters need to be better educated but you shouldn \u2019 t give them actual education .\nIt doesn \u2019 t make any sense.\n\u201d Moreover , disclosure needs to be timely , said Heather Taylor-Miesle , executive director for the Ohio Environmental Council .\nIn the case of HB 6 , Generation Now didn \u2019 t report its 2017 spending to the Internal Revenue Service until late 2019 .\nBy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to influence the 2018 elections , the passage of HB 6 , and the failed referendum effort against it .\nSeveral bills introduced by Democratic and Republican lawmakers could make a strong start toward improved disclosure , including HB 737 , HB 739 , and SB 347 .\nThose bills should be broadened to include digital media , as well as more traditional campaign spending , Turcer said .\nThe bills should also call for disclosure not only of the name of an organization , but the identity of the top three original @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her Sept. 16 testimony in support of SB 347 .\n\u201c Otherwise , wealthy special interests will attempt to avoid disclosure by creating pop-up shell groups , \u201d she said .\nAnd while Ohio voters won \u2019 t know who \u2019 s behind all the groups funding attack ads or other political spending this election season , information is available about how lawmakers voted on HB 6 .\nThe Akron Beacon Journal has also compiled some information on how some funds were used in the 2018 Ohio House campaigns .\n\u201c People should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if they want to speak out about the issue , Stokes said , noting that the law passed with support from a mix of both Republicans and Democrats .\n\u201c When the public is outraged about an issue and really shows up , these issues get reversed , \u201d Stokes added .\n\u201c There \u2019 s a lot of leverage

"source": "activistpost", "title": "Does The Coronavirus Make Our Constitutional Freedom Of Assembly Obsolete?", "content": "Over the past couple of weeks a trend has become apparent in the state of Idaho , specifically in Moscow , Idaho in Latah County .\nThe city council of Moscow has issued a mandatory mask order , and they are using police to enforce it .\nBizarrely , the city had ZERO deaths from Covid at the time the mask order was instituted , meaning their action was in response to\u2026nothing .\nIdaho has had a total of 500 deaths from Covid since the beginning of the outbreak .\nTo put this in perspective , the state also has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and 250 deaths from the flu/pneumonia according to the CDC .\nPerhaps they should ban sugar , and make masks mandatory for the flu as well , just to be safe\u2026 The residents of Moscow are not too happy with the city council attempt to unilaterally enforce such mandates .\nChurch congregations in particular are fighting back by holding outdoor services without masks .\nThe city has responded by ARRESTING the pastors of any church that dare to defy mask laws .\nI bring up this specific instance of coronavirus enforcement because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it is not surprising that Latah County is one of the ONLY counties in Idaho that leans to the far-left politically , and the majority of the city council of Moscow is made up of leftists .\nMoscow is also the home of the University of Idaho .\nIt seems wherever the political left sets up shop , Constitution-violating mandates on the coronavirus are prevalent .\nEven if a state government is predominantly more conservative and less antagonistic on lockdowns , left leaning city and county officials have decided they are going @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Second , the mask rules are being used against people who held meetings outdoors , and this is something I am seeing all over the world right now .\nWhy is the science of virus behavior in outdoor open air environments not being discussed AT ALL in the mainstream ?\nWhy is no one talking about the fact that open air and UV rays from sunlight KILL microorganisms ?\nThe chance of contracting the coronavirus outdoors is next to zero , yet mask rules are being strictly instituted from Melbourne , Australia to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Idaho .\nGovernment officials must surely be aware that the science contradicts these orders .\nAnd if this is the case , then this only confirms that such restrictions are not about saving lives ; they are about control .\nThird , the use of targeted arrests against organizers of group events is clearly an attempt to frighten the public into compliance without confronting their concerns directly .\nThe goal is to encourage self-censorship and to manipulate citizens to avoid public assembly without coming out openly and saying \u201c We are banning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an end-run around the constitution , and these actions are increasing in the US .\nAs I have noted in past articles , I have been watching the draconian coronavirus measures in Australia and New Zealand very closely .\nMy concerns rest on the other side of the world because what I see happening there is perhaps a beta-test for high intensity lockdown restrictions in other Western nations including America .\nRestrictions in these countries are rooted in what they are calling \u201c Level 4 lockdowns \u201d , and include mandatory mask orders @ @ @ @ @ @ @ distancing , bans on public assembly , church closures , citizens are not allowed to travel more than 3 miles from home ( essentially people are under house arrest , with only one hour per day outside to exercise ) , people who contract the virus or are suspected of being infected can be locked up in Covid camps for as long as government officials deem it necessary , and in New Zealand these camps are managed by the military .\nPeople speaking out against the lockdowns online are being arrested for \u201c @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is nearly dead .\nI believe the establishment of medical tyranny is moving so quickly in Australia because the vast majority of the population has been disarmed and they have limited means to fight back .\nIt \u2019 s an easy place to test out control measures .\nProtests are taking place , but without a means of self defense the citizenry is at the mercy of government and law enforcement .\nIf the government wants to crack down violently on anti-lockdown groups , there will be little the public can do to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in places like Moscow , Idaho is the initial stages of medical tyranny similar to what is happening in Australia .\nWhat I see is an incremental form of totalitarianism , and it simply can not be tolerated .\nWe have heard it often during this pandemic event that we are \u201c all in this together \u201d and the lockdowns are \u201c serving the greater good \u201d , but this is nonsense .\nThe constitutional rights of public assembly and freedom of religion in particular are being stifled , and these rights ARE @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more important than the lives of the select few people who are susceptible to the virus .\nBeyond that , why are we not talking about the number of people that are losing their jobs due to the lockdowns ?\nHow about the number of people that will die over time from poverty or depression or economic collapse because of the lockdowns ?\nIs it not a matter of the \u201c greater good \u201d that we end the restrictions rather than increase them ?\nNo virus is worth this .\nIt would not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Black Plague .\nUltimately , though , Covid affects a very small portion of the US population .\nThe real solution to the pandemic is simple : The people who are most susceptible should voluntarily stay home and quarantine , and the rest of us should get on with our lives with an open economy and normal constitutional rights .\nWhy is this option not being presented ?\nMask laws in particular are truly bizarre .\nThere is little evidence that cloth masks are effective in the slightest , but the idea that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in order for the masks to work reveals the true nature of the restrictions .\nIf your mask is useless unless I also wear a mask , then the masks we are wearing are not offering much protection and their enforcement should be questioned .\nThe fact that numerous states and counties across the US have had infection spikes even with strict mask mandates suggests to me that the masks are pointless .\nEven the CDC questions the effectiveness of cloth masks and recommends N95 masks for healthcare workers until there is some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the CDC doesn \u2019 t believe they work very well , then why are people even wearing them , and why are people being arrested for refusing to use them ?\nAgain , the science does not support the mandates , so they must be about control rather than saving lives .\nIf you can get a population acclimated to having the government involved in the smallest intricacies of their lives on a daily basis then freedom goes out the window and the establishment enjoys total power to do whatever they please .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ if a person WANTS to wear a mask , or take other precautions no matter how dubious , then I have nothing bad to say about them .\nThat is their decision .\nIf a business wants to require masks before entering , then that is also their right as property owners .\nI can choose to not shop there if I don \u2019 t like it .\nBut it is not anyone \u2019 s right to attempt to force others to comply with their baseless rules just so they can personally feel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wearing a mask and you don \u2019 t like it , then don \u2019 t come near me ; it \u2019 s very easy .\nAs leftists like to say : My body my choice .\nTake note of how many instances we have seen so far of Mask Nazis physically attacking people not wearing masks .\nIsn \u2019 t this the exact opposite of what they have been preaching ?\nAlso take note that Mask Nazis tend to be avid supporters of BLM and Antifa mobs that ignore pandemic restrictions .\nAgain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ health issues , they are angry because you are not submitting to their control .\nAnother terrifying development during the pandemic is the use of executive orders and executive authority to initiate restrictions without public oversight .\nHere is the bottom line : No government , whether it be federal , state or local , has the power to violate your constitutional rights .\nPeriod .\nIf a law or executive order tramples on the Bill of Rights , then it is automatically null and void and should be defied .\nNational emergencies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of what statists might claim .\nExecutive orders in particular are based on nothing other than color of law .\nIn most cases they do not legally apply to the citizenry , only to government employees .\nReal laws are passed by the legislature , and are often added to a ballot to be voted on by the public .\nNo governor , mayor , city council or president has the authority to assert new laws without oversight like a dictator .\nThe political left has been quick to point out these facts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yet they are also quick to defend those orders issued by states and cities to enforce unconstitutional and illegal lockdowns .\nIn the end , whether you respect the Bill of Rights or not , laws are meaningless unless they are backed by principles .\nA law that is immoral and unjust should not be followed .\nGovernment representatives that abuse their positions to assert powers that are not granted them by the constitution should be unseated .\nThe coronavirus changes nothing \u2013 not a thing .\nI would suggest that anyone who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to enforce restrictions that are contrary to the Bill of Rights act now to disrupt what is likely an incremental march towards medical tyranny .\nIf you don \u2019 t stand in opposition to these actions now , they will only grow over time until a majority of people become conditioned to accept them .\nIf you

Communications Commission Chairman Ajit Pai \u2013 and a LAWSUIT filed against the regulatory agency \u2013 all Americans have paid to have this already .\nNevertheless , telecom industries have been dragging their feet with providing it .\nThey also aren \u2019 t interested in providing safe high-speed internet access \u2013 only 5G \u2013 despite increasing expert opposition and warnings .\nApparently , one employee of a little-known government agency is making this more difficult for them .\nThe ACHP Is Defending the Public Interest Adapted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Oct 7 , 2020 | Inside Sources article here In June of 2019 , Aimee Jorjani was confirmed by the U.S. Senate as the first full-time chairman of the obscure Advisory Council on Historic Preservation ( ACHP ) .\nThe council is a creation of the National Historic Preservation Act ( NHPA ) and its job is to \u201c promote the preservation , enhancement , and sustainable use of our nation \u2019 s diverse historic resources , \u201d according to its mission statement , as well as \u201c advising the President and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ At issue is the little-known but immensely important problem of \u201c Twilight Towers.\n\u201d American companies are running neck-and-neck with Chinese competitors , and President Trump has made boosting America \u2019 s 5G technology one of his top priorities .\nOne stumbling block to the densified 4G/5G roll out is U.S. infrastructure , in particular the towers needed to connect exurban and rural Americans to the new , higher-capacity 5G network ( greater bandwidth particularly in low-to-mid frequency spectrum ( 600 MHz to 6000 MHz ) .\n\u201c Twilight Towers \u201d is the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or so cell towers built between 2001 and 2005 whose siting didn \u2019 t undergo the historical preservation review now required , or lack documentation proving they passed muster .\nMany are larger ( or \u201c macro \u201d ) towers outside densely populated urban communities .\nWireless companies wish to upgrade these towers with additional 5G equipment , significantly increasing the Effective Radiated Power emitting from these towers .\nSome state-level historic preservation groups and representatives of Native American tribes want these existing towers to undergo a full review .\nAfter a decade @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ajit Pai announced last year a solution was in the works , and the ACHP was going to be a part of it .\nPai \u2019 s plan , passed 5-0 by the bipartisan members of the FCC , would prohibit these towers from being expanded or extended , but it would allow new , upgraded technology to be placed on them \u2014 a practice known in the wireless industry as \u201c collocation \u201d \u2014 significantly increasing the electromagnetic power pollution from these towers .\nIn their filing with the FCC , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ communications industry \u2014 predictably called the plan \u201c a balanced solution that clears the way to expanded use of these towers \u2014enabling the public \u2019 s access to expanded wireless services\u2014and also fully safeguards the historic preservation interests that the NHPA protects \u201d , whether or not this additional pollution is a wise trade off .\nOn August 24 , the FCC sent over its request for the ACHP to issue a \u201c program comment \u201d on the proposal , putting the process on a 45-day clock .\nAll that \u2019 s left @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vote by her commission and its GOP-backed majority this Thursday , when the measure is expected to pass easily .\nInstead , Jorjani has single-handedly stopped the process in its tracks .\nJorjani is telling the White House that she may support a delay \u2014 a delay that would push the issue past the upcoming election .\nThis move has left GOP senators and administration officials flummoxed .\nJorjani worked for six years at the Department of the Interior during the Bush administration and was a staffer in former GOP Speaker of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ During her confirmation hearing , she told Sen .\nRob Portman ( R-Ohio ) she \u201c looked forward to finding a solution to this set of towers.\n\u201d \u201c The infrastructure is

essentially appointed to this job to do one thing : fix this \u201c Twilight Towers \u201d problem , \u201d an administration source told InsideSources @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do that , the White House may decide to make a last-second change to get this done.\n\u201d Asked why Jorjani was thwarting the FCC \u2019 s plan , Jonathan S. Adelstein , president and CEO of the Wireless Infrastructure Association , told InsideSources : \u201c We don \u2019 t know .\nWe \u2019 ve been desperately trying to reach out to her , but she won \u2019 t return our calls .\nShe \u2019 s not interested in hearing our side of the story.\n\u201d Sources inside the FCC note the agency @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about the existing towers in the past 19 years .\n\u201c If these towers have a siting problem , nobody \u2019 s noticed it in nearly twenty years , \u201d an FCC insider said .\nPerhaps Filber optic cables for wireleine internet access is the best way to offer Internet connectivity , while preserving valuable historic and environmental protections .\nThe National Association of Tower Erectors ( NATE ) and the Wireless Infrastructure Association ( WIA ) applauded the FCC \u2019 s significant vote to seek public comment on a plan to exclude @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of wireless communications equipment on \u201c twilight towers \u201d .\nIt has been estimated by the FCC that those structures total more than 4,200 nationwide .\nThe affirmative vote from FCC Commissioners took place during today \u2019 s open FCC meeting and addresses an issue that for too long has placed the industry in regulatory limbo .\nThe Wireless industry \u2019 s benefits of making existing twilight towers available for collocation , as recognized by the FCC , are : \u2013 Less intrusive \u2013 for environment and historic/cultural sites \u2013 than new towers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ effects Twilight towers are communication structures built between March 16 , 2001 and March 7 , 2005 that have not been eligible for collocations in the same way as towers that have documented Section 106 historic preservation review and clearance or towers that were exempted due to being built prior to the pre 2001 Standard .\n\u201c NATE sincerely appreciates the solutions-oriented leadership displayed today by Chairman Ajit Pai and Commissioners Brendan Carr , Mignon Clyburn , Michael O \u2019 Rielly and Jessica Rosenworcel in order to address the regulatory status of twilight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ open up thousands of communication structures for wireless colocation deployment activities , \u201d stated Executive Director Todd Schlekeway .\n\u201c NATE member companies are on the front lines building , deploying and maintaining wireless infrastructure in the United States and today \u2019 s action by the FCC is yet another positive development for our membership as we continue to lead the way on the road to 5G , \u201d added Schlekeway .\nJonathan Adelstein , President and CEO of WIA said : WIA worked closely with CTIA to provide the FCC with comments @ @ @ @ @ @ @ meetings and workshops .\nEarlier this year , Commissioner O \u2019 Rielly addressed industry stakeholders at WIA \u2019 s annual conference in Orlando .\nAmong other important issues , O \u2019 Rielly made it clear that he wanted to resolve the issue and free up these valuable facilities for collocation .\n\u201c My goal is to ensure that we put an end to the twilight towers issue once and for all , \u201d he said .\nThe decision to open up twilight towers to collocation is also based on the limited likelihood that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any impact on historic properties .\nAs WIA pointed out to the FCC , the majority of wireless infrastructure projects reviewed through the Tribal consultation process have had no adverse effects on historic properties .\n\u201c There is no reason to believe twilight towers are any different that towers that were built during any other time period , \u201d Adelstein said .\n\u201c No formal complaints were filed by a Tribe or a Tribal Historic Preservation Office claiming a tower has had an adverse effect on their cultural preservation efforts .\nIn fact @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reduce the number of new towers and therefore reduce the amount of ground disturbance that comes with new construction.\n\u201d The FCC is supposed to

for decades .\nA more recent example is Google \u2019 s decision to ban ad revenue for those going against the Coronavirus Disease 2019 ( COVID-19 ) \u201c consensus.\n\u201d CNBC @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ads from running on stories spreading debunked coronavirus conspiracy theories , \u201d would claim : Those \u201c conspiracy theories \u201d might include questioning the official death rates of COVID-19 .\nYet even the British government itself has been recently forced to investigate its statistics regarding death rates , vindicating the very sort of people who would have been either forced into silence or forced to give up ad revenue .\nThe London Guardian in its article , \u201c Matt Hancock orders urgent review of PHE Covid-19 death figures , \u201d would admit : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , induce greater public panic and pave the way for billions in government handouts to pharmaceutical giants is at the very core of many of these so-called \u201c conspiracy theories \u201d Google seeks to silence through its campaign of financial coercion .\nImagine if this chilling effect was achieved sooner .\nWould the British government have even bothered investigating its faulty statistics if there weren \u2019 t people suspicious of them ?\nThe chilling effect this has over openly discussing something as serious as COVID-19 considering its socioeconomic impact is truly alarming and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the so-called \u201c free world \u201d overseen by its self-appointed arbitrators in the US , UK and EU .\nA similar campaign was carried out to purge Google , Twitter and Facebook of anyone allegedly connected with \u201c Russia \u201d who also so happened to be anti-war and anti-NATO for waging those wars .\nEntire lists are compiled by Western government-funded organizations which are then submitted to these tech giants for purging .\nThe Western media writes accompanying articles announcing , justifying and spinning the purges\u2026 but also sending a warning to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u2019 t going to be tolerated on these platforms .\nContent creators are faced with two decisions ; to either self-censor themselves to protect their work , their audiences and their livelihood , or to accept the possibility they will eventually be \u201c purged \u201d ( censored ) and need to rebuild their audiences from scratch on platforms with far fewer potential readers , viewers and patrons .\nSocial media , of course , is no longer social media in this sort of environment , but more akin to the sort of programmed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ power on over the course of the 20th and early 21st century .\nOf course the defense is that Google , Facebook and Twitter are \u201c private companies \u201d and can do as they please with their platforms .\nIn reality , these companies work in tandem with Western governments whether it is fomenting political destabilization abroad or creating \u201c consensus \u201d at home .\nThe notion that censorship is \u201c OK \u201d because the US , UK and EU governments launder it through private companies ignores the close relationship these companies have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have been transformed into defacto public squares and critical channels of public communication and participation .\nThe West \u2019 s growing overt censorship leaves it with a choice ; to either accept that it is in reality as guilty of censorship and manipulating the public as it has claimed its opponents are , or continue pretending it isn \u2019 t but at the continued cost of its legitimacy upon the global stage .\nThere is a very good reason the West is in decline around the globe and why its attempts to leverage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u201c free speech \u201d against nations like China or Russia are increasingly impotent .\nThat reason can be found , at least in part , among the growing number of purge lists , censorship campaigns and calls for \u201c consensus \u201d across Western social media .\nFinally , the increasingly overt nature of censorship and controlled narratives promoted by tech giants like Google , Facebook and Twitter should have them facing restrictions and bans around the globe .\nWhy should any nation host a \u201c public square \u201d where discourse is entirely controlled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u2019 t a local alternative be created instead where the revenue is kept locally and if narratives are to be controlled , controlled in a way that best suits people locally ?\nIt is ironic that , China for example , is condemned for not allowing Google , Facebook and Twitter to operate freely within their information space because it is a violation of \u201c free speech , \u201d even as Google , Facebook and Twitter cudgel free speech on their own respective platforms .\nHow much longer will the world tolerate these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , organizations and even entire nations begin creating alternatives to Google , Facebook and Twitter to at the very least balance out the lopsided power and influence they have collectively accrued and abused ?\nGunnar Ulson , a New York-based geopolitical analyst and writer especially for the online magazine \u201c New Eastern Outlook \u201d .", "author": "Activist Post", "url":

( Oct 12 , 2020 ) \u2013 Last week , Vermont Gov .\nPhil Scott allowed a bill that creates a structure to tax and regulate the sale of marijuana become law without his signature despite federal prohibition .\nHe also signed a second measure to create a process for the automatic expungement of some marijuana possession convictions .\nA bipartisan coalition of Senators introduced Senate Bill 54 ( S.54 ) in January 2019 .\nVermont legalized the possession of one ounce or less and home cultivation of marijuana by adults over 21 in 2018 , but the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ distribution of cannabis for the recreational market .\nEnactment of S.54 creates a regulatory structure for the cultivation and sale of marijuana in the state .\nThe new law will create various categories of business licenses and a taxing structure .\nThe Senate initially passed S.54 by a 23-5 vote in February 2019 .\nThe House passed a significantly amended version of the bill on Feb. 27 of this year on a voice vote .\nThe bill was then referred to a conference committee made up of three representatives and three senators to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bill was approved by the House by a 92-56 vote .\nThe Senate gave its final approval 23-6 .\nWith Gov .\nScott \u2019 s commitment not to veto the bill , the law went into effect Oct. 7 .\nMany sections went into immediate effect .\nOther sections of the law will go into effect over time beginning on Jan. 1 , 2021 .\nScott , a Republican , raised a number of concerns about the new law but said that S.54 \u201c did move forward in a lot of areas that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ still isn \u2019 t exactly what I \u2019 d like to see and there are some shortcomings.\n\u201d ( You can read more about Scott \u2019 s comments HERE . )\nScott signed a second bill creating an automatic expungement process for some marijuana convictions .\nSen. Richard Sears ( D-North Bennington ) introduced Senate Bill 234 ( S.234 ) in January .\nUnder the new expungement process , individuals convinced of marijuana possession of up to two ounces will have their records automatically reviewed and cleared .\nThe legislation also lifts a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disclose them .\nS.234 also decriminalized possession of over one ounce of marijuana .\nThe House passed S.234 by a vote of 113 to 10 .\nThe Senate approved the measure today by a voice vote .\nScott signed the bill on Oct. 7 .\nThe marijuana expungement provisions will go into effect on Jan. 1 .\nBoth of these measures became law despite the federal government \u2019 s continued prohibition of marijuana .\nVermont legalized medical marijuana back in 2004 .\nThe decriminalization of recreational marijuana last year removed another layer of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cannabis , and the enactment of S.54 would take yet another step forward .\nDespite this , federal prohibition remains on the books .\nUnder the Controlled Substances Act ( CSA ) passed in 1970 , the federal government maintains complete prohibition of marijuana .\nOf course , the federal government lacks any constitutional authority to ban or regulate marijuana within the borders of a state , despite the opinion of the politically connected lawyers on the Supreme Court .\nIf you doubt this , ask yourself why it took a constitutional amendment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ away state laws criminalizing cannabis is significant because FBI statistics show that law enforcement makes approximately 99 of 100 marijuana arrests under state , not federal law .\nWhen states stop enforcing marijuana laws , they sweep away most of the basis for 99 percent of marijuana arrests .\nFurthermore , figures indicate it would take up to 40 percent of the DEA \u2019 s yearly annual budget just to investigate and raid all of the dispensaries in Los Angeles \u2013 a single city in a single state .\nThat doesn \u2019 t @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The lesson ?\nThe feds lack the resources to enforce marijuana prohibition without state assistance .\nVermont joins a growing number of states increasingly ignoring federal prohibition , and nullifying it in practice .\nColorado , Washington state , Oregon and Alaska were the first states to legalize recreational cannabis , and California , Nevada , Maine and Massachusetts joined them after ballot initiatives in favor of legalization passed in November 2016 .\nMichigan followed suit when voters legalized cannabis for general use in 2018 .\nIllinois legalized cannabis through legislative action in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cannabis for medical use , the feds find themselves in a position where they simply can \u2019 t enforce prohibition anymore .\nThe lesson here is pretty straightforward .\nWhen enough people say , \u2018 No !\n\u2019 to the federal government , and enough states pass laws backing those people up , there \u2019 s not much the feds can do to shove their so-called laws , regulations or mandates down our throats .\nEfforts to legalize commercial sales of marijuana in Vermont underscore another important strategic reality .\nOnce a state @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a very limited way \u2013 it tends to eventually expand .\nAs the state tears down some barriers , markets develop and demand expands .\nThat creates pressure to further relax state law .\nThese new laws represent a further erosion of

hard .\nAnd according to data company Envestnet Yodlee , there is evidence that this is already happening\u2026 Already , there \u2019 s some evidence that grocery sales are rising , according to data

tighter , and global demand for food will just continue to shoot higher .\nSo I would stock up while you still can , because prices will never be lower than they are right now .\nMeanwhile , our

debatable .\nWhile \u201c censor \u201d is perhaps not the most accurate term to use here\u2014given the word \u2019 s connotations of state intervention\u2014it is apparent that social media firms , at the very least , limit discussion and the reach of certain political viewpoints by banning certain users .\nThese firms also openly admit to biasing readers against certain content through the use of \u201c fact checkers.\n\u201d Anecdotal evidence also strongly suggests that these social media firms also engage in tactics @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hides certain posts and content from certain users .\nThis is no haphazard or \u201c neutral \u201d bias , either .\nIt is clear that the user bans and \u201c fact checking \u201d warnings against certain posts are designed to fall most often on groups that could be described as \u201c conservative , \u201d or \u201c libertarian , \u201d or which advocate in favor of Donald Trump and his allies .\nAs far as media companies go , this is just par for the course .\nWhat is perhaps so unusual in this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and libertarians seem surprised that things turned out this way .\nThis may be due to the fact that many continue to believe the false notion that social media companies are a sort of \u201c public utility.\n\u201d The social media companies themselves promote this myth and like to give the impression that they are open forums facilitating open communication .\nIn reality , the firms are essentially just media companies like CNN , NBC , or the New York Times .\nThe only meaningful difference here is that social media firms don @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ABC News or the Washington Post do .\nRather , social media companies have convinced their users to produce all the content .\nThe social media companies then reap the rewards in terms of selling personal information to advertisers and curating user-produced content to suit the companies \u2019 own vision and needs .\nUltimately , the lesson to be learned here is that anyone who holds opinions outside a center-left or far left narrative should expect about as much \u201c fairness \u201d from social media firms as one might expect from CNN or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we should expect social media firms to ignore and marginalize the very same opinions and groups that have been ignored and marginalized by established media companies for decades .\nThis also means that organizations , writers , and publishers of these verboten opinions must do what they \u2019 ve always done : create their own publications and find effective methods of disseminating their content outside the control of establishment gatekeepers .\nMore seasoned observers of media behavior , of course , aren \u2019 t surprised or shocked when they hear that social media @ @ @ @ @ @ @ parameters of acceptable debate or silence certain voices .\nThe establishment media , its reporters , and its editors have viewed this kind of \u201c censorship \u201d as both necessary and laudable since at least the early twentieth century .\nIt was at that time that American progressives began to make headway with the idea that journalists should act as gatekeepers of truth and that \u201c the press \u201d should determine for itself what it was that people ought to be allowed to read and know .\nAs I noted last year , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Walter Lippmann \u2019 s 1922 book Public Opinion .\nLippmann contended that ordinary people are incapable of reading about events from diverse sources and making up their own minds .\nRather , it was necessary for experts to provide only \u201c controlled reporting and objective analysis.\n\u201d But how is this \u201c objective analysis \u201d to be achieved ?\nThe answer , according to Lippman , lies in making journalism more scientific , and in making facts \u201c fixed , objectified , measured , [ and ] named.\n\u201d Thus was born the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who was above bias and who communicated to the public the only truth .\nNaturally , this implies that all \u201c untrue \u201d narratives must therefore be silenced .\n[ RELATED : \u201c \u2018 Objective Journalism \u2019 Has Always Been a Myth \u201d by Ryan McMaken ] In reality , of course , the journalists and editors themselves , like all human beings , brought with them their own biases and partisan sympathies .\nAs the twentieth century progressed , journalism schools at colleges and universities cemented certain biases among those who went @ @ @ @ @ @ @ By mid-century , changes in the technological and media landscape narrowed the number of media outlets and the public became increasingly dependent on fewer and fewer editors and journalists at a shrinking number of companies .\nAs Bruce Thornton has explained at the Hoover Institution : This transformation did not go unnoticed .\nBy the 1940s , it was increasingly clear that a distinction had arisen between the \u201c establishment \u201d media and what would come to be known as \u201c alternative media.\n\u201d As Moira Weigel noted in her review of Claire @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Political Junkies : Although the new regulatory regime was allegedly devoted to \u201c fairness , \u201d more adroit observers understood that fairness was really just whatever the major media companies defined as \u201c mainstream \u201d while everything else came to be defined as beyond the pale of civilized discussion .\nNaturally , many conservative groups opposed to the \u201c center \u201d \u2014which in the mid-twentieth century really meant a center-left bent reflecting the views of mid-century university professors and other \u201c experts \u201d like Schlesinger himself\u2014understood that the new fairness excluded their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for $ 1 per month at Patreon .\nBy the 1940s , \u201c conservative \u201d groups\u2014i.e.\n, pretty much anyone opposed to the New Deal and its legacy\u2014realized they needed to found their own organizations .\nAs noted by Nicole Hemmer at The Atlantic : This \u201c alternative media \u201d included other publications , many of which came out of the \u201c Old Right , \u201d such as the inimitable Frank Chodorov \u2019 s publication analysis , founded in 1944 .\nChodorov described it as \u201c an individualistic publication\u2014the only one of its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would go on to edit another new alternative magazine called The Freeman , founded in 1954 .\nRightist organizations like these , however , were not the only ones in the alternative media landscape .\nWeigel notes that independent journalists on the left were also objecting to the mainstream view being promoted by major outlets like the New York Times .\nSpecifically , the work of left-wing journalist Izzy Stone became influential through his acolyte Seymour Hersh : These organizations became all the more solidified in this belief when it became apparent that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ use the \u201c fairness doctrine \u201d to silent dissenters .\nPaul Matzko recounts how , \u201c Conservative radio broadcasting surged in the early 1960s as a result of the rise of non-network , independent radio stations that were cash-strapped and willing to air people whose politics were too radical for network radio.\n\u201d These independent radio broadcasters criticized the Kennedy administration on a wide variety of topics from trade to foreign policy .\nThe administration took notice , and By the late 1960s , it was clear who was in charge of media @ @ @ @ @ @ @ outlets backed up by the federal government .\nIt was these players who would decide what was \u201c fair , \u201d what was \u201c the center , \u201d and what was acceptable political debate .\nNaturally , this wasn \u2019 t done through any explicit announcements .\nRather , the media used tactics such as what political scientists call \u201c agenda setting , \u201d \u201c framing \u201d and \u201c priming \u201d to set the terms of acceptable debate .\nThese tactics involve the media emphasizing certain events over others , creating standards by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and simplifying issues by presenting only a small number of opposing viewpoints .\nThis naturally has the effect of limiting which viewpoints end up being perceived by the public as \u201c normal.\n\u201d Viewpoints outside those presented as mainstream then strike the viewer or reader as \u201c extreme.\n\u201d Moreover , as the media picks and chooses which events to cover , some events and persons gain prominence in the national discussion while others fade into the background .\nThis is an easy way to manipulate how the public views which facts are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ effect of all this is that many ideologies , persons , and facts are \u201c censored \u201d simply as a result of being ignored or excluded by media stories in broadcasts and printed texts .\nThe Rise of the Internet In spite of all this , many independent media organizations continued to make inroads into the establishment media domain through radio broadcasts .\nThis was especially true of conservative and right-wing broadcasts , which became immensely popular during the 1990s and early 2000s and influenced the media landscape considerably .\nThe most successful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Show , although there were many imitators such as Michael Medved , Sean Hannity , and Michael Savage .\nSo lucrative had this conservative \u201c alternative \u201d become that Fox News , which began broadcasts in 1996 , attempted to capitalize on the notion of presenting \u201c unbiased \u201d news that would depart from the bias of organizations like CNN and NBC News .\n\u201c We Report , You Decide \u201d became the tagline , and many followers of conservative talk radio tuned in to hear the allegedly unbiased version of broadcast television @ @ @ @ @ @ @ internet websites became increasingly influential .\nThe Drudge Report , which began as an email newsletter in 1995 and went online in 1997 , attracted an enormous readership after it became a source for information on the Clinton-Lewinsky scandal , which the establishment media had initially refused to carry .\nBy 1999 , numerous editors , webmasters , and organizations\u2014ones generally ignored by the establishment media\u2014were founding their own websites and producing their own content .\nSites like LewRockwell.com , Antiwar.com , and Mises.org\u2014among countless others\u2014were gaining access to a far larger audience @ @ @ @ @ @ @ days of mailed newsletters .\nMeanwhile , more established publications like National Review moved much of their content online , capturing a much larger audience than had ever been possible in the days of magazines sent only to paid subscribers .\nDuring this period , it is understandable that many followers of alternative media began to believe that it would finally become possible to compete with the old establishment media on its own terms .\nAfter all , for the first time , any organization could inexpensively purchase a domain name , start @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u2019 s materials and opinions accessible to the general public .\nIn most cases , these websites were free to readers .\nThis represented quite a departure from the days of newsletters , monthly magazines , and newspapers that were costly to produce and which reached audiences sometimes numbering only hundreds of people .\nNow , the same points of view once hidden in obscure newsletters could be read by anyone , and could be linked from other websites .\nThese articles could easily be quoted , reproduced , and even promoted through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nBeing an alternative news source suddenly got a whole lot easier , even if an organization still had to engage in the hard work of building an audience .\nBy the early 2000s , however , it was clear that the establishment media wasn \u2019 t about to disappear .\nIn fact , many large national news organizations increased in power .\nThis occurred because the proliferation of free online news sources and classified ads decimated revenue for smaller newspapers and news organizations .\nMid-sized and small newspapers began to shrink or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Washington Post and the New York Times increased .\nMoreover , old TV-viewing habits were difficult to change , and TV broadcasting continued to dominate the news cycle , even if commentary and alternative points of view could easily be found online for free .\nAlthough the internet had made it far easier to deliver other viewpoints to readers , these readers still had to go out of their way to actually visit and read these sites .\nFor many , it remained easier to just turn on the television and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before them .\nWith the rise of smartphones and social media , however , it looked like even small organizations might be able to place themselves in front of readers with even less effort .\nAll that was necessary was for social media users to \u201c like \u201d your organization and then the reader would receive updates in news feeds as new information came online .\nIt looked like the alternative media would be able to use social media to engage the reader every time he or she casually scrolled through the \u201c @ @ @ @ @ @ @ smartphone .\nBy 2016 , however , it was clear it wasn \u2019 t going to be so simple as all that .\nBy then it was increasingly evident that social media companies were using their software to control what the readers saw in their news feeds beyond the readers \u2019 use of the Like button .\nMoreover , accusations continued to mount that companies like Facebook and Twitter were curating the content within their listed \u201c trending \u201d topics and within the newsfeeds to emphasize certain stories while hiding other points of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , editors , and curators at social media firms\u2014many of whom worked within corporate cultures extremely similar to those found at establishment media firms\u2014were interested in presenting a controlled news stream to readers .\nSocial media firms continue to pretend to be \u201c platforms , \u201d but they are , in fact , media companies that edit and control what the public can see .\nThis , of course , was to be expected .\nThere was never any reason to assume that the content managers meeting in offices at Facebook would be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a newsroom at the Washington Post .\nThese gatekeepers had their own set of biases and were more than happy to use their power to favor their preferred ideological bent .\nThe alternative media\u2014and its readers\u2014had made the mistake of thinking social media was an unbiased and objective player .\nIt wasn \u2019 t .\nAnd it isn \u2019 t .\nFar from changing the game fundamentally , social media has actually helped to continue a trend that was already accelerating during the mid-twentieth century .\nIt has helped to further centralize gatekeeping @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hands of a relatively small number of people .\nSocial media companies are acting just like the big media companies before them , which began consolidating power in the early decades of broadcasting .\nThey exclude \u201c dangerous \u201d and alternative points of view while favoring the views expressed by establishment \u201c experts.\n\u201d Moreover , social media has simply added its weight to the overall monolith of establishment media , which\u2014while in decline\u2014is anything but irrelevant .\nIndeed , traditional media like television likely remain more influential than social media .\nWhile @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over their many users , the fact remains that social media companies do not actually control access to information on the internet .\nAnyone is free to actually visit the websites that social media firms are acting to hide from their readers \u2019 eyes .\nMoreover , barriers to entry when it comes to creating publicly accessible online content remain quite low .\nWith television , however , one can not simply switch to a seemingly endless number of independent and alternative new sources .\nTelevision broadcasting remains prohibitively expensive for firms outside @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nAccess is even more constrained for on-air broadcasts , which remain tightly controlled by federal regulators .\nWhen it comes to broadcasting , competition remains far more tightly controlled than is the case with the internet .\nAnd TV news remains extremely influential , especially among people who actually vote .\nAlthough young Americans are watching less and less TV , the over-40 population , which votes more often than younger cohorts , still receives a very large amount of its news from organizations like CNN and Fox News .\nTV news @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u201d but the fact remains that the voter turnout for the over-60 cohort is about double that of the 18\u201329 age group .\nMeanwhile , nearly 50 percent of Americans 65 and older still get their news from traditional TV .\nFifty-eight percent of the over-65 group \u201c often \u201d get news from cable TV .\nTelevised news is also relatively more central in the media habits of nonwhites and women .\nWe could contrast this with Twitter , which the establishment media often treats as if it were a representative slice of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ percent of Americans use Twitter at all , and the overwhelming number of posts on Twitter are produced by only 10 percent of users .\nTwitter is primarily the domain of people who have graduate degrees , are white , and are left of center in their politics .\nIt could be that Twitter may be the news source of the future , but for now , people who actually vote get far more of their news from TV or other sources .\nIn any case , it should be clear that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hasn \u2019 t actually changed much with the rise of social media .\nAny journalist , commentator , or organization that wishes to provide \u201c alternative \u201d views and critiques must fight to draw readers away from the dominant media companies , which enjoy all the advantages of deep pockets and support from university professors , government bureaucrats , and the wealthy .\nIn social media\u2014as in the established old media\u2014editors , curators , and managers work to promote their own self-described \u201c mainstream \u201d views while excluding as \u201c extreme \u201d the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the status quo we \u2019 ve long been facing

Michigan Creates Process to Expunge Some Marijuana Charges", "content": "LANSING , Mich. ( Oct 16 , 2020 ) \u2013 On Monday , Michigan Governor Gretchen Whitmer signed a bill into law that creates a process to expunge certain marijuana convictions .\nThe new law will allow people to clear their records and take another small step toward nullifying federal marijuana prohibition in effect .\nRep. Luke Meerman ( R ) introduced House Bill 4982 ( HB4982 ) last year with a large bipartisan coalition of cosponsors .\nUnder the new law , people with misdemeanor marijuana convictions can now petition the court to have the conviction set aside .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ the conviction was based on activity that would not have been a crime if committed after the state legalized marijuana in December 2018 .\nProsecutors can petition to block expungement , but they must do so within 60 days of the application .\nIn effect , the expungement will clear all public record of the conviction .\nLaw enforcement will still maintain a non-public record .\nUnder the law , people no longer have to disclose the conviction on job applications or other forms .\nThis eliminates the lifelong struggle for people with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ applying for jobs , housing and other things .\nOn Sept. 23 , the Senate approved an amended version of the House bill by a 35-2 vote .\nThe House concurred with the amended version by a 98-7 vote .\nOn Oct. 12 , Whitmer \u2019 s signed the bill and it went into immediate effect .\nThe new law will not only help some people with prior marijuana arrests and convictions on their records get a new start , but it will also further undermine federal marijuana prohibition .\nAs marijuana becomes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the feds , the federal government is less able to enforce its unconstitutional laws .\nIn the past , we \u2019 ve seen some opposition to marijuana legalization bills because the new laws generally leave those previously charged and convicted unprotected .\nThe enactment of HB4982 demonstrates an important strategic point .\nPassing bills that take a step forward sets the stage , even if they aren \u2019 t perfect .\nOpening the door clears the way for additional steps .\nYou can \u2019 t take the second step before you take the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Act ( CSA ) passed in 1970 , the federal government maintains complete prohibition of marijuana .\nOf course , the federal government lacks any constitutional authority to ban or regulate cannabis within the borders of a state , despite the opinion of the politically connected lawyers on the Supreme Court .\nIf you doubt this , ask yourself why it took a constitutional amendment to institute federal alcohol prohibition .\nDespite federal prohibition , Michigan legalized marijuana by referendum in 2018 .\nThis removes a huger layer of laws punishing the possession @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but federal prohibition remains in effect .\nThis is significant because FBI statistics show that law enforcement makes approximately 99 of 100 marijuana arrests under state , not federal law .\nWhen states stop enforcing marijuana laws , they sweep away most of the basis for 99 percent of marijuana arrests .\nBecome

19 million to curry favor in 2011 when it decided to acquire NBC Universal .\n\u2022 T-Mobile parent company has spent more than $ 8 million in each of the last three years as it cozies up to legislators ahead of its attempts to acquire Sprint and consolidate two of the four largest mobile @ @ @ @ @ @ @ last two decades , the telecom industry has seen a significant amount of consolidation .\nThey have also come under additional scrutiny , especially as it relates to privacy and control over the internet .\nSince the Federal Communications Commission under the Obama administration introduced and passed the Open Internet Order in 2010 in an effort to establish and protect net neutrality , lobbying from internet service providers has spiked .\nWhile telecom companies gave to both parties in nearly equal measures throughout the last decade , they have found considerably more support @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u2019 s FCC has since overturned the rules that protected net neutrality \u2014 a concept that prevented ISPs from blocking , censoring or slowing the flow of data online .\nTelecom giants also scored a victory when lawmakers voted to reverse an FCC rule that prevented ISPs from selling consumer data without explicit permission .\nThat vote took place primarily on party lines , and every representative that voted in favor of the measure was a Republican .\nGiven the recent successes telecom companies have had , it seems likely they will continue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on lobbying .\nAs states begin to launch their own efforts to pass and enforce internet privacy laws , ISPs may start dumping more money into state and local elections .\nIt also seems likely that major battles will continue to take place at the federal level , resulting in even more spending .\nComparitech found that spending from 2016 to 2019 is expected to exceed lobbying expenses from 2012 to 2015 , which totaled $ 295 million .\nOf course , legislators aren \u2019 t the only ones who have sold out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The Federal Communications Commission ( FCC ) replaced the EPA as the regulatory body appointed to protect Americans from the telecom industry .\nThey are NOT a health or environmental

LOUIS , Mo .\n( Oct. 22 , 2020 ) \u2013 Last weekend , the first medical marijuana dispensaries opened in Missouri despite federal prohibition .\nRetail medical marijuana sales kicked off in the Show-Me State last Saturday with the opening of two dispensaries run by N \u2019 Bliss in the St. Louis area .\nAnother dispensary opened Monday in the Kansas City area .\nMissouri legalized medical marijuana through a ballot measure in 2018 .\nUnder the law , the Missouri Department of Health and Senior Services was tasked with establishing a licensing structure for the cultivation , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Patients can grow up to six marijuana plants ; a licensed caretaker can cultivate up to 18 .\nDoctors can recommend medical cannabis for any condition they see fit ; there is no specific list of qualifying disorders .\n\u201c I don \u2019 t want to take any more pills , \u201d she said .\n\u201c I know this will help .\nTo be quite honest , I have tried it and , yes , it does help.\n\u201d According to Marijuana Moment , the state has licensed 192 retailers to date .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ state \u2019 s medical access program .\nUnder the federal Controlled Substances Act ( CSA ) passed in 1970 , the federal government maintains complete prohibition of marijuana .\nOf course , the federal government lacks any constitutional authority to ban or regulate cannabis within the borders of a state , despite the opinion of the politically connected lawyers on the Supreme Court .\nIf you doubt this , ask yourself why it took a constitutional amendment to institute federal alcohol prohibition .\nDespite federal prohibition , Missouri legalized medical marijuana .\nThis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ possession and use of marijuana in the state , even though federal prohibition remains in effect .\nThis is significant because FBI statistics show that law enforcement makes approximately 99 of 100 marijuana arrests under state , not federal law .\nWhen states stop enforcing marijuana laws , they sweep away most of the basis for 99 percent of marijuana arrests .\nFurthermore , figures indicate it would take 40 percent of the DEA \u2019 s yearly-budget just to investigate and raid all of the dispensaries in Los Angeles \u2013 a single city @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u2019 t include the cost of prosecution .\nThe lesson ?\nThe feds lack the resources to enforce marijuana prohibition without state assistance .\nMissouri joins a growing number of states increasingly ignoring federal prohibition , and nullifying it in practice .\nColorado , Washington state , Oregon and Alaska were the first states to legalize recreational cannabis , and California , Nevada , Maine and Massachusetts joined them after ballot initiatives in favor of legalization passed in November 2016 .\nMichigan followed suit when voters legalized cannabis for general use in 2018 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ legalize marijuana through a legislative act in 2018 .\nIllinois followed suit in 2019 .\nWith 34 states including Missouri allowing cannabis for medical use , the feds find themselves in a position where they simply can \u2019 t enforce prohibition anymore .\nThe lesson here is pretty straightforward .\nWhen enough people say , \u2018 No !\n\u2019 to the federal government , and enough states pass laws backing those people up , there \u2019 s not much the feds can do to shove their so-called laws , regulations or

Lockstep With The \u201cGreat Reset\u201d", "content": "In October 2019 , a pandemic simulation exercise called Event 201 \u2013 a collaborative effort between Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security , World Economic Forum , and Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation \u2013 concluded that a hypothetical new coronavirus may end up killing at least 65 million people worldwide within 18 months of an outbreak .\nWhen COVID-19 coincidentally emerged from Wuhan two months later , scientists were rushing to generate similar alarmist forecasts using a variety of questionable scientific models .\nResearchers from the Imperial College London , for instance , approximated death tolls of 500,000 ( UK @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by October this year .\nTo those following the metastasis of the global vaccine mania , the Imperial model was predictably \u201c tidied up \u201d with the help of Microsoft .\nWhile scientific models are admittedly fallible , one would nonetheless be hard-pressed to justify the endless string of contradictions , discrepancies and wilful amnesia in the global pandemic narrative .\nIn fact , one should question whether COVID-19 even deserves the tag of a \u201c pandemic \u201d .\nAccording to the United States \u2019 Centre for Disease Control ( CDC ) , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ happen to be : Ages 0-19 ( 99.997 % ) ; 20-49 ( 99.98 % ) ; 50-69 ( 99.5 % ) ; and 70+ ( 94.6 % ) .\nThe mortality rates are only slightly higher than the human toll from seasonal flu and are , in fact , lower than many ailments for the same age cohorts .\nIf the CDC statistics don \u2019 t lie , what kind of \u201c science \u201d have we been subjected to ?\nWas it the science of mass-mediated hysteria ?\nThere are other troubling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the theory of bats or pangolins being the source of COVID-19 ?\nWho was Patient Zero ?\nWhy was there a concerted media agitprop against the prophylactic use of hydroxychloroquine that was backed by the Indian Council of Medical Research ( ICMR ) no less ?\nAnd why did Prof Neil Ferguson , who had led Imperial \u2019 s contagion modelling , repeatedly breach lockdown measures to meet his paramour \u2013 right after his recommendations were used to justify draconian lockdowns worldwide which continue till today ?\nMost damning yet , why are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Russia \u2019 s Sputnik V vaccine ?\nAfter all , Moscow \u2019 s credibility , both scientific and otherwise , is on the line here .\nIn a real pandemic , nobody would care where an effective remedy comes from .\nThe virus does not care about borders and geopolitics ; so why should we politicize the origins of an antidote ?\nPerhaps what we are really dealing with here is a case of mass \u201c coronapsychosis \u201d as Belarussian President Alexander Lukashenko aptly called it .\nWho benefits from global lockdowns that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ?\nThe following four \u201c great \u201d undercurrents may provide a clue .\nAs the author had warned for more than a decade , the world is staring at a confluence of risk overloads , socioeconomic meltdowns ( 1 ) and a Second Great Depression .\nFor the ruling classes , COVID-19 is fortuitously deflecting public attention away from the disastrous consequences of decades of economic mismanagement and wealth fractionation .\nThe consolidation of Big Tech with Big Media ( 2 ) has created an Orwellian world where collective hysteria is shifting loci @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disagree with the pandemic narrative .\nWe have entered a \u201c new normal \u201d where Pyongyang , North Korea , affords more ambulatory freedom than Melbourne , Australia .\nWhile rioting and mass demonstrations by assorted radicals are given a free pass \u2013 even encouraged by leaders in the West \u2013 Facebook posts questioning lockdowns are deemed subversive .\nThis is a world where Australian Blueshirts beat up women , manhandle a pregnant woman in her own home , and perform wolf pack policing on an elderly lady in a park .\nYet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Victoria remains unfazed by the unflattering moniker of Kim Jong Dan .\nThe corona-totalitarianism is unsurprisingly most pronounced in the Anglosphere and its dependencies .\nAfter all , these nations are staring at socioeconomic bankruptcies of unprecedented proportions vis-\u00e0-vis their counterparts .\nEven their own governments are being systematically undermined from within .\nThe US Department of Homeland Security , created in the aftermath of 9/11 to combat terrorism , is now providing $ 10 million in grants to organizations which supposedly combat \u201c far-right extremism and white supremacy \u201d .\nThis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ razing US cities and its economies in the name of social justice .\nThere is , however , a curious rationale behind this inane policy as the following section illustrates .\nWhile the circus continues , the bread is thinning out , except for the Top 0.001 % .\nInstead of bankruptcy , as recent trends indicated , Silicon Valley and affiliated monopolies are notching up record profits along with record social media censorship .\nUS billionaires raked in $ 434 billion in the first two months of the lockdown alone .\nThe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wealth accrued to the techno-elite .\nAs tens of millions of individuals and small businesses face bankruptcy by Christmas , the remote work revolution is gifting multibillion dollar jackpots to the likes of Jeff Bezos ( Amazon ) and Mark Zuckerberg ( Facebook ) .\nAzure ( Microsoft ) and AWS ( Amazon ) cloud eco-systems , among others , have expanded by 50 % since the beginning of the pandemic .\nIn the face of such runaway wealth fractionation , panoptic contact tracing tools from Big Tech are increasingly employed to pacify @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to prevent a second , third or Nth wave of COVID-19 for our collective good !\nIn the meantime , Big Banks , Big Pharma , Big Tech and other monopolies are getting lavish central bank bailouts or \u201c stimulus packages \u201d to gobble up struggling smaller enterprises .\nCOVID-19 is a gift that never stops giving to a select few .\nBut how will the techno-oligarchy maintain a degree of social credibility and control in an impoverished and tumultuous world ?\nOligarchic philanthropy will be a dominant feature of this VUCA decade @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recent Guardian report , philanthropic foundations have multiplied exponentially in the past two decades , controlling a war chest worth more than $ 1.5 trillion .\nThat is sufficient to bankroll a horde of experts , NGOs , industry lobbies , media and fact-checkers worldwide .\nLarge sums can also be distributed rapidly to undermine governments .\nThe laws governing scientific empiricism are no longer static and immutable ; they must dance in tandem with the funding .\nThose who scream fake news are usually its foremost peddlers .\nThis is yet another @ @ @ @ @ @ @ predated COVID-19 by decades .\nThe Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation ( BMGF ) is a prime example of how oligarchic philanthropy works .\nSince 2000 , it has donated more than $ 45 billion to \u201c charitable causes \u201d and a chunk of this is designed to control the global media narrative .\nThe Guardian , rather tellingly , credits the BMGF for helping eradicate polio despite contrary reports of wanton procedural abuses , child death tolls and poverty exploitation which routinely mar the foundation \u2019 s vaccination programs .\nBill Gates @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a 20-to-1 return on investments , as he effused to CNBC last year .\nAs for the BMGF \u2019 s alleged polio success , officials now fear that a dangerous new strain could soon \u201c jump continents \u201d .\nAfter spending $ 16 billion over 30 years to eradicate polio , international health bodies \u2013 which work closely with BMGF \u2013 have \u201c accidentally \u201d reintroduced the disease to Pakistan , Afghanistan , and Iran .\nPoverty , hunger and desperation will spawn a tangible degree of public gratitude despite elite philanthropy \u2019 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ causes .\nBy the Guardian \u2019 s own admission , \u201c British millionaires gave \u00a31.04bn to the arts , and just \u00a3222m to alleviating poverty \u201d in the 10-year period to 2017 .\nContrast this with the annual $ 10 billion earmarked by the philanthropic pool for \u201c ideological persuasion \u201d in the US alone .\nThe rabble is worth their weight only for the potential havoc they can wreak .\nThere is enough money floating around to reduce our cities into bedlams of anarchy as seen in the United States today .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Nov 3 US presidential elections ) .\nThe crumbs left over can be delegated to threadbare charities .\nOne only needs to reflect on soup kitchens in the post-1929 Weimar Republic .\nThe most popular ones were organized by the Nazi party and funded by wealthy patrons .\nThe march towards a new order has a familiar historical meme .\nThe new Brownshirts are those who terrorise citizens for not wearing masks , for not being locked down in their pens , and for simply supporting a political candidate of choice .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ oligarchic narrative are not spared !\nA great pruning will inevitably occur in the mega-billionaire club as whatever remains of the global corona-economy is systematically cannibalized .\nThe club will get smaller but wealthier and will attempt to sway our collective destiny .\nControl over education , healthcare , means of communications and basic social provisions is being increasingly ceded by governments to the global elite .\nGovernments colluding in the \u201c new normal \u201d will sooner or later face the ire of distressed masses .\nPoliticians and assorted \u201c social justice warriors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ outlived their usefulness .\nIn this cauldron , the century-old technocratic dream of replacing politicians , electoral processes and businesses with societies run by scientists and technical experts ( 4 ) may emerge \u2013 thanks to advances in panoptic technologies .\nIt will be an age for the \u201c rational science of production \u201d and \u201c scientific collectivism \u201d .\nThe latter is eerily redolent of the Soviet sharaska ( prison labs ) system .\nThe production and supply of goods will be coordinated by a central directorate ( 5 ) , led @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , where they exist , will be nominal anyway ) but by technocrat factotums .\nPerhaps this is what the World Economic Forum refers to as the Great Reset .\nIn reality , though , this idea smacks of a global Gosplan minus the Doctor Sausages for the innumerable many .\n( Some emerging economies like Malaysia and India casually refer to technocracy as an infusion of greater technical expertise into bureaucracy .\nThis is a misinterpretation of technocracy \u2019 s longstanding means and goals ) .\nOne intractable problem remains : will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of various deep states worldwide ?\nInitially , both groupings may cooperate to their mutual benefit but their respective raisons d \u2019 \u00eatre are too contradictory to be reconciled .\nOne thrives on an \u201c open society \u201d run by obedient hirelings who will administer a global Ministry of Truth , while the other depends on secrecy and a degree of national sovereignty to justify its existence .\nSurveillance technologies ushered in by the ongoing \u201c coronapsychosis \u201d may end up being the deciding factor in this struggle .\nAfter all , if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the United States and the White House can be blatantly censored today , think of the repercussions for billions of people worldwide tomorrow ?\nAn abridged version of this article was published by RT on Oct 14 1 .\nMaavak , M.

2019 The New York Times announced that the media outlet had partnered with tech behemoth , Verizon , to create a 5G Journalism Lab .\nBecause of this partnership , most would agree that it would be a \u201c conflict of interest \u201d for them to publish biased articles of 5G opposition .\nThat \u2019 s one of , unfortunately , countless examples of how \u201c news \u201d can become biased because of business affiliations .\nThe term that has become synonymous with biased news is \u201c Fake News.\n\u201d With fake news on the minds of a lot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to figure out how to sift through the information landscape to find the facts .\nToday we get some ideas from Nolan Higdon , a lecturer of history and media studies and author of \u201c The Anatomy of Fake News.\n\u201d He takes us on an examination of our news today , to show us both the critical framework and the history behind fake news .\nSharyl : What is your definition of \u201c fake news \u201d ?\nNolan Higdon : Yeah .\nI chose a broad definition , so any false or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ journalism or news content .\nSharyl : And what made you decide to write a book about it ?\nHigdon : Well , after 2016 , I was kind of somewhat optimistic because finally we were talking about fake news .\nBut I quickly became pessimistic as the conversations devolved into Trump and the Russians and conservative news websites , and it became a quite a partisan debate .\nRachel Maddow ( March 2017 ) news clip : As the Russian Trump questions continue to percolate and ultimately got more accute over time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to answer .\nHigdon : And I was off-put by the partisanship and the creation of lists .\nI thought it was kind of McCarthy-like to create lists of these are good news , these are bad news .\nAnd so I wanted to write a book to tell the story of fake news , a much larger problem .\nAnd I don \u2019 t think lists are going to save us , but I do think there are ways we can mitigate the pernicious influence of fake news .\nSharyl : Do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ neither ?\nHigdon : I mean , I \u2019 m kind of all over the ideological spectrum .\nI mean , I tend to lean left , but I guess that \u2019 s how I \u2019 d define myself .\nSharyl : And what \u2019 s the bottom line of the book ?\nBecome an Activist Post Patron for $ 1 per month at Patreon .\nHigdon : The bottom line of the book is that I don \u2019 t think we \u2019 re going to save ourselves from the fake news problem @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or governments to censor content .\nI think we \u2019 re going to have to empower people with the critical media literacy skills to learn how to think , not what to think .\nSharyl : A lot of media literacy efforts or efforts to curate our information for us have turned out to be , I think , cloaked efforts by third parties and political interests and corporate interests to actually shape the information , rather than make people understand how to become more literate .\nWhat is your view on that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about this extensively in the book .\nI \u2019 m very concerned about the way that corporations have taken over the media literacy movement and increasingly are wiggling their way into the classroom to not only dictate what is media literacy , but collect and operationalize data on students .\nSo I think that those of us who advocate for media literacy need to be very clear that we \u2019 re not advocating for corporate media literacy .\nSharyl : Do you think that the talk about fake news was largely driven by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ continued discussion election-driven here as we approach the 2020 election ?\nHigdon : I think the only time it gets into the mainstream sort of culture or corporate media is generally when it \u2019 s focused on elections .\nIt \u2019 s become a real partisan issue , the idea of fake news .\nSharyl : Do you think it \u2019 s a good step forward for third parties , such as social media companies , to offer to curate fake news for us and to make those decisions ?\nOr do you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up to the individual ?\nHigdon : The book makes it very clear , and I would make it very clear , that we should never have corporations , regardless of their ideological underpinnings , making decisions about what is or is not fake news for us .\nSharyl : What \u2019 s the big danger of that ?\nHigdon : You empower fake news producers .\nThey themselves are profiting from the fake news problem , so they have an economic incentive to continue this problem , not solve it .\nSharyl @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our own government can be responsible or a responsible party when it comes to fake news ?\nHigdon : Our government is not only responsible , they have a long history of producing and disseminating fake news .\nA lot of it got exposed in the Cold War era of fake news .\nA lot of it got exposed with the Church Committee hearings .\nBut you can even go back to establishment papers like the New York Times .\nIn 2008 , David Barstow released some reporting on how the intelligence community @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was on traditional news networks and news outlets .\nSo our government unfortunately has not only produced fake news overseas , but also domestically .\nSharyl : What is the main thing you think is a takeaway ?\nWhat is the main thing that the public doesn \u2019 t know or may not think about that they ought to ?\nHigdon : I guess one of the things I would consider the public to think about is we are in somewhat of an information war , whether it be to get your votes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , to get you to do something , and corporations have new advantages in the digital age .\nAs we talked about before , fake news isn \u2019 t a digital age problem , but it has been intensified in the digital age because now they collect all of your data .\nIt creates graphic profiles of you , and when that content gets in fake news producers \u2019 hands , they can construct content that is targeted directly at you , that preys upon your basic instincts , attitudes , and behaviors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u201c The Anatomy of Fake News \u201d also includes a \u201c fake news detection kit \u201d where Higdon gives ten ways to identify fake news and be sure you

(2020)", "content": "This message is for anyone who has concerns about the upcoming U.S. elections , the potential for chaos and civil unrest , or those who fear what a \u201c second wave \u201d of Covid-19 could mean for the future of humanity .\nIf you have found this message on your own please share it with your friends and family .\nIf someone you care about recommended you watch this , please do so with an open mind .\nWe are in the last few months of a tumultuous year and it appears there might be more unprecedented events on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it \u2019 s important to step back and analyze the potential plans of the Predator Class .\nSpecifically , it \u2019 s important to understand a number of recent government simulations and exercises .\nFirst , let \u2019 s look at the exercise known as Event 201 .\nOne year ago , on October 18 , 2019 , the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation partnered with the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security and the World Economic Forum on a high-level pandemic exercise known as Event 201 .\nEvent 201 simulated how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coronavirus pandemic known as CAPS which swept around the planet .\nThe simulation imagined 65 million people dying , mass lock downs , quarantines , censorship of alternative viewpoints under the guise of fighting \u201c disinformation , \u201d and even floated the idea of arresting people who question the pandemic narrative .\nCoincidentally , one of the players involved with Event 201 was Dr. Michael Ryan , the head of the World Health Organization \u2019 s team responsible for the international containment and treatment of COVID-19 .\nRyan has called for looking into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ isolate them from their families .\nDue to the vast web of connections between Bill Gates and nearly every organization connected to the COVID-19 fight , a growing number of researchers are questioning the motivations of Gates and the other officials involved in the Event 201 exercise .\nAnother exercise known as Crimson Contagion simulated an outbreak of a respiratory virus originating from China .\nFrom August 13 to August 16 , 2019 , Trump \u2019 s Department of Health and Human Services ( HHS ) , headed by Alex Azar , partnered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ local organization for the exercise .\nAccording to the results of the October 2019 draft report , the spread of the novel avian influenza ( H7N9 ) resulted in 110 million infected Americans , 7.7 million hospitalizations , and 586,000 deaths .\nAnother simulation known as Clade X took place on May 2018 .\nThis event examined the response to a pandemic resulting from the release of a fictional virus known as Clade X .\nIn the simulation , the virus was released by a terror group called A Brighter Dawn .\nAs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the participants asked what would be needed if the President issued a federal quarantine , noting that authorities would need to \u201c Determine ( the ) level of force authorized to maintain quarantine.\n\u201d The Clade X exercise also resulted in the federal government nationalizing the healthcare system .\nThe leaders of these controversial pandemic simulations that took place before the Coronavirus crisis have longstanding connections to the U.S. Intelligence and the U.S. Department of Defense .\nEven more troubling is that key players in the exercises \u2013 specifically , Event 201 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ history in another biowarfare simulation known as Dark Winter .\nThe Dark Winter exercise took place in June 2001 , only months before the 9/11 attacks .\nThis exercise took place at Andrews Air Force Base in Camp Springs , Maryland , and involved several Congressmen , a former CIA director , a former FBI director , government insiders and privileged members of the press .\nThe exercise simulated the use of smallpox as a biological weapon against the American public .\nDuring the Dark Winter exercise authorities attempt to stop the spread @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unverified \u201d cures , just like with the Event 201 simulation .\nDark Winter further discusses the suppression and removal of civil liberties , such as the possibility of the President to invoke \u201c The Insurrection Act \u201d , which would allow the military to act as law enforcement upon request by a State governor , as well as the possibility of \u201c martial rule.\n\u201d The script says martial rule may \u201c include , but are not limited to , prohibition of free assembly , national travel ban , quarantine of certain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ habeas corpus [ i.e .\narrest without due process ] , and/or military trials in the event that the court system becomes dysfunctional.\n\u201d Become an Activist Post Patron for $ 1 per month at Patreon .\nWhat is important to know is Dark Winter was largely written and designed by Tara O \u2019 Toole and Thomas Inglesby of the Johns Hopkins Center along with Randy Larsen and Mark DeMier of the Analytic Services ( ANSER ) Institute for Homeland Security .\nO \u2019 Toole , Inglesby , and Larsen were directly involved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attacks which took place in the days after September 11 , 2001 .\nThese individuals personally briefed Vice President Cheney on Dark Winter .\nCoincidentally , Event 201 was co-hosted by the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security , which is currently led by Dark Winter co-author Thomas Inglesby .\nTara O \u2019 Toole was also a key player in the Clade X simulation .\nThe name for the exercise comes from a statement made by Robert Kadlec , a veteran of the George W. Bush administration and a former lobbyist for military @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Kadlec states that the lack of smallpox vaccines for the U.S. populace means that \u201c it could be a very dark winter for America.\n\u201d Kadlec is now leading HHS \u2019 Covid-19 response and was also involved in the Trump administration \u2019 s 2019 \u201c Crimson Contagion \u201d exercises .\nEerily , Kadlec \u2019 s statements in 2001 exercise were recently repeated nearly word for word by Richard Bright , former director of Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority .\nBright was recently celebrated as a whistleblower who attempted to hold the Trump @ @ @ @ @ @ @ However , while speaking in front of Congress , Bright stated , \u201c without clear planning and implementation of the steps that I and other experts have outlined , 2020 will be darkest winter in modern history.\n\u201d Now , maybe Bright is simply a concerned scientist warning about the potential for more sick people , but his use of the phrase \u201c darkest winter \u201d is hard to ignore .\nWhen hearing the statements from Kadlec and Bright we ought to consider the corporate media \u2019 s promotion of a potential \u201c @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Gates and other influential pundits and health authorities have consistently warned about a second wave which was slated to arrive in the fall of 2020 .\nAs of mid-October 2020 , reports are beginning to come in that \u201c cases are on the rise \u201d .\nThis is what makes the statement from Richard Bright all the more concerning .\nThis leads us to a number of recent simulations of the 2020 U.S. election which have resulted in chaos and potential civil war .\nIt would be easy to dismiss these exercises as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had not already publicly advised their candidate not to concede the election under any circumstances .\nMost recently , media reports indicated the Transition Integrity Project ( TIP ) held a number of exercises simulating what might happen in the event Donald Trump loses the 2020 election , but refuses to leave office .\nThe TIP itself is a secretive group made up of \u201c Never Trump \u201d neocon Republicans and Democrats associated with the Obama administration and Hillary Clinton .\nThe Boston Globe reported that the TIP met in June to simulate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ November 3rd and Inauguration Day on January 20 , 2021 .\nThe exercises state that \u201c Trump and his Republican allies used every apparatus of government \u2014 the Postal Service , state lawmakers , the Justice Department , federal agents , and the military \u2014 to hold onto power , and Democrats took to the courts and the streets to try to stop it.\n\u201d The TIP envisioned one scenario where Trump wins and Biden refuses to concede and instead asks for a recount and makes several demands , including to give statehood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and divide California into 5 states .\nIn the exercises Joe Biden is played by John Podesta , Hillary Clinton \u2019 s 2016 campaign manager and chief of staff to former President Bill Clinton .\nThe simulations essentially end in a constitutional crisis where there is no clear President and the Supreme Court or possibly the military play a deciding role .\nThis unprecedented event could be disastrous for American life as it is likely activists from both sides of the vote would take to the streets to protest what they believe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If you think protests and fights between extreme leftists and extreme right wingers are contentious , just wait until they both feel shafted during the presidential election .\nThose opposed to Trump will claim Biden won and Trump is attempting to steal the election and create a fascist dictatorship .\nThe Trump supporters will say the Satanic Radical Leftist Democrats are attempting a coup to establish a Communist Police State .\nThe result will be neighbor turning against neighbor , family members disowning one another , and some political activists may escalate their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ groups were similarly engaged in \u201c war games \u201d that predicted complete chaos in the U.S. on election day as well as the imposition of martial law .\nThis includes the \u201c Operation Blackout \u201d simulations conducted by the U.S.-Israeli company , Cybereason .\nThat company has considerable ties to the U.S. and Israeli intelligence .\nOperation Blackout involved hackers taking control of city buses around the U.S. , crashing into voters waiting in line at polling stations , hacked traffic lights causing accidents , and the release of \u201c deepfakes \u201d to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the cancellation of the 2020 election and the imposition of martial law .\nWhile Donald Trump continues to stoke the flames of division and uncertainty surrounding election 2020 , the Establishment is also preparing for the possibility of martial law in response to this chaos .\nMeanwhile , the public is being prepped for a second wave of COVID-19 infections which could lead to the foreshadowed Darkest Winter .\nWhile we don \u2019 t care to instill fear we do encourage everyone to heed these warnings and be prepared for potential unrest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ election .\nIn conclusion , I believe we may have a narrow window of time to inform our friends and family , and motivate them to prepare for what may be on the horizon .\nWe can spend our time attempting to convince them of the lies of COVID-19 .\nWe can also try to educate them about the numerous exercises predicting chaos and civil unrest across the United States .\nAs important as education is in the Information War ; now might be the time to focus our energy on helping our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nRather than attempting to convince them to see what you see or believe what you believe , perhaps we can simply help keep them safe until they can clearly see the writing on the wall .\nAgain , if you are hearing of these exercises and topics for the first time , please listen with an open mind .\nI want to emphasize that I do not write these words in hopes of inspiring fear or stress .\nIn fact , I hope that this analysis can paint a clear enough picture @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so we may act !\nIt is only by honestly facing our circumstances that we can hope to influence and change the path of humanity .\nThis is a historic time to be alive and we have the opportunity to play a powerful role .\nIt \u2019 s time to shake off the shackles and expose those who seek to hold us back for their own sick purposes .\nDerrick is the founder of TCRN .\nSubscribe

\u2019 s partly because I just want to be entertained , but Kanye \u2019 s philosophy is the polar opposite of what we \u2019 re accustomed to .\nThat is why he is appealing and why the establishment thinks he \u2019 s unhinged .\nAs far as I can tell , there are two distinct philosophies that rulers act upon : \u2022 The ends justifies the means \u2013 willingness to act unethically to achieve an outcome that \u2019 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for peace .\nWe \u2019 ve been dominated by rulers that follow this path for our entire lifetime .\n\u2022 Peace is the path \u2013 always do the moral and ethical thing in the moment with faith that it leads to the best outcomes .\nLike Kanye , I think the majority of humans at least try to live by this philosophy .\nKanye \u2019 s commitment to this leadership philosophy is bolstered by his faith that \u201c serving God \u201d ( doing the morally right thing in every moment ) will have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was a powerful moment in Kanye \u2019 s recent Joe Rogan interview where he was asked what he would do as president if facing a military threat .\nKanye instantly felt the gravity of life and death , paused in quiet reflection , and said a prayer asking God to give him the strength to ask the right questions to be able to make wise decisions .\nNo other modern politician displays that instinctive empathy for all sides before contemplating tough decisions .\nAnd note , he wasn \u2019 t praying for a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the strength to ask the right questions .\nI \u2019 m not even particularly religious , but that level of authenticity and wisdom is inspiring compared to the status quo .\nThe ruling class and their establishment cronies don \u2019 t understand Kanye \u2019 s appeal because they have no faith or ethical boundaries .\nNothing is out of bounds for them .\nThey justify lying , cheating , stealing and killing to gain power to ram through their agenda .\nEven if they genuinely believe their \u201c ends \u201d are \u201c just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nAs evidence , former Secretary of State Madeleine Albright said 500,000 dead Iraqi children was \u201c worth it \u201d to attempt regime change in Iraq .\nAnd Obama/Biden awarded her the Presidential Medal of Freedom for her failed sanctions that caused immense pain for no benefit .\nEventually , they lied everyone into a preemptive war in Iraq for regime change and millions more perished .\nAnd the country is still far worse off now seventeen years later .\nWe \u2019 re in an environment where the establishment media praises Trump for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bombs Syria but chastises him for troop withdrawals .\nTrump has some good instincts but he is the ultimate pragmatist .\nPragmatists rarely hold strong principles and they are willing to behave unethically to achieve their ends .\nHe is also a Populist , meaning he senses where the crowd is going and changes his position to stand in front of them .\nFor instance , Trump has gone from a vaccine skeptic to Vaccine Czar following the COVID-1984 scarefest .\nTrump once criticized the national debt , cheap-dollar monetary policy , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unemployment .\nNow he wholly embraces and brags about them .\nAs for Biden , he \u2019 s been wrong ( anti-freedom violent authoritarian ) on every major issue his entire career from his crime bill , voting for all preemptive wars , authoring the Patriot Act , unethical side dealing to get rich , and now advocating harsher lockdowns and mandates to deal with a fraudulently-exaggerated pandemic .\nIs it any wonder why many are tired of being ruled by people

.\nI \u2019 ll admit it \u2019 s partly because I just want to be entertained , but Kanye \u2019 s philosophy is the polar opposite of what we \u2019 re accustomed to .\nThat is why he is appealing and why the establishment thinks he \u2019 s unhinged .\nAs far as I can tell , there are two distinct philosophies that rulers act upon : \u2022 The ends justifies the means \u2013 willingness to act unethically to achieve an outcome that \u2019 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for peace .\nWe \u2019 ve been dominated by rulers that follow this path for our entire lifetime .\n\u2022 Peace is the path \u2013 always do the moral and ethical thing in the moment with faith that it leads to the best outcomes .\nLike Kanye , I think the majority of humans at least try to live by this philosophy .\nKanye \u2019 s commitment to this leadership philosophy is bolstered by his faith that \u201c serving God \u201d ( doing the morally right thing in every moment ) will have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was a powerful moment in Kanye \u2019 s recent Joe Rogan interview where he was asked what he would do as president if facing a military threat .\nKanye instantly felt the gravity of life and death , paused in quiet reflection , and said a prayer asking God to give him the strength to ask the right questions to be able to make wise decisions .\nNo other modern politician displays that instinctive empathy for all sides before contemplating tough decisions .\nAnd note , he wasn \u2019 t praying for a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the strength to ask the right questions .\nI \u2019 m not even particularly religious , but that level of authenticity and wisdom is inspiring compared to the status quo .\nThe ruling class and their establishment cronies don \u2019 t understand Kanye \u2019 s appeal because they have no faith or ethical boundaries .\nNothing is out of bounds for them .\nThey justify lying , cheating , stealing and killing to gain power to ram through their agenda .\nEven if they genuinely believe their \u201c ends \u201d are \u201c just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nAs evidence , former Secretary of State Madeleine Albright said 500,000 dead Iraqi children was \u201c worth it \u201d to attempt regime change in Iraq .\nAnd Obama/Biden awarded her the Presidential Medal of Freedom for her failed sanctions that caused immense pain for no benefit .\nEventually , they lied everyone into a preemptive war in Iraq for regime change and millions more perished .\nAnd the country is still far worse off now seventeen years later .\nWe \u2019 re in an environment where the establishment media praises Trump for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bombs Syria but chastises him for troop withdrawals .\nTrump has some good instincts but he is the ultimate pragmatist .\nPragmatists rarely hold strong principles and they are willing to behave unethically to achieve their ends .\nHe is also a Populist , meaning he senses where the crowd is going and changes his position to stand in front of them .\nFor instance , Trump has gone from a vaccine skeptic to Vaccine Czar following the COVID-1984 scarefest .\nTrump once criticized the national debt , cheap-dollar monetary policy , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unemployment .\nNow he wholly embraces and brags about them .\nAs for Biden , he \u2019 s been wrong ( anti-freedom violent authoritarian ) on every major issue his entire career from his crime bill , voting for all preemptive wars , authoring the Patriot Act , unethical side dealing to get rich , and now advocating harsher lockdowns and mandates to deal with a fraudulently-exaggerated pandemic .\nIs it any wonder why many are tired of being ruled by people like this ?\nIn fact , Trump is President primarily because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Yet it \u2019 s become clear that he shares the same morally-compromised philosophy as the rest of them .\nNow that we seem to be experiencing the collapse of everything \u2013 truth , liberty , logic , trust in institutions , economy , faith , etc .\n\u2013 an authoritarian policy mechanic can not fix this .\nIt \u2019 s going to take someone who believes in freedom .\nA leader with firm principles to provide a moral beacon .\nSomeone who is fearless and uncompromising in the face of evil

and state governments persuaded judges to issue 99 % of all requested intercepts .\nAn intercept is any type of government surveillance \u2013 telephone , text message , email , even in-person .\nThese are intercepts that theoretically are based on probable cause of crime , as is required by the Fourth Amendment to the Constitution .\nThe 2019 numbers \u2013 which the government released as we were all watching the end of the presidential election campaign \u2013 are staggering .\nThe feds , and local and state police in America engaged in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arrested 17,101 people from among those intercepted and obtained convictions on the basis of evidence obtained via the intercepts on 5,304 .\nThat is a conviction rate of 4 % of all people spied upon by law enforcement in the United States .\nHere is the backstory .\nReaders of this column are familiar with the use by federal agents of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act to obtain intercepts using a standard of proof considerably lesser than probable cause of crime .\nThat came about because Congress basically has no respect for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ issue intercept warrants if federal agents can identify an American or a foreign person in America who has spoken to a foreign person in another country .\nCall your cousin in Florence or a bookseller in Edinburgh or an art dealer in Brussels , and under FISA , the feds can get a warrant from the FISA Court to monitor your future calls and texts and emails .\nThis FISA system is profoundly unconstitutional ; the Fourth Amendment expressly requires that the government \u2013 state and federal \u2013 can only lawfully engage in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by a judge based upon a showing under oath of probable cause of crime .\nThe Supreme Court has ruled consistently that intercepts and surveillances constitute searches and seizures .\nThe government searches a database of emails , texts or recorded phone calls and seizes the data it wants .\nThus , when the feds have targeted someone for prosecution and lack probable cause of crime about that person , they resort to FISA .\nThis is not only unlawful and unconstitutional , but also it is corrupting , as it permits criminal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ evidence of crimes outside the scope of the Fourth Amendment .\nThe use of the Fourth Amendment is the only lawful means of engaging in surveillance sufficient to introduce the fruits of the surveillance at a criminal trial .\nIf the feds happen upon evidence of a crime from their FISA-authorized intercepts , they then need to engage in deceptive acts of parallel construction .\nThat connotes the false creation of an ostensibly lawful intercept in order to claim that they obtained lawfully what they already have obtained unlawfully .\nLaw enforcement personnel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to acquire evidence \u2013 even duping the prosecutors for whom they work \u2013 so the evidence will appear to have been obtained lawfully and thus can be used at trial .\nAt its essence , parallel construction is a deception on the court .\nIf the deception is perpetrated under oath , it is perjury \u2013 a felony .\nThis corruption of the Constitution by those in whose hands we have reposed it for safekeeping happens every day in America .\nThe FISA-induced corruption has regrettably bled into the culture of non-FISA law @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nThe statistics I cited above are not from FISA \u2013 those numbers are secret .\nRather , the statistics reflect the government \u2019 s voracious appetite for spying that now pervades non-FISA law enforcement .\nThis is so because judges accept uncritically the applications made before them for intercept or surveillance warrants .\nThus , even though the Fourth Amendment permits judges to issue warrants only upon the probable likelihood of evidence of a crime in the place to be searched or the person or thing to be seized , the attitude @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attenuated by both the law enforcement personnel who seek warrants and the judges who hear the applications .\nWe know this because we have not seen a number like 99 % of all warrant applications \u2013 every one supposedly based on probable cause of crime \u2013 granted .\nNor have we seen only 4 % of those intercepts resulting in convictions .\nThe rational conclusion is that the government \u2019 s appetite for surveillance remains voracious , and judges \u2013 whose affirmative duty it is to uphold the Constitution as against the other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very little to abate this .\nSo , what becomes of the remaining 96 % of those on whom the government spied ?\nThat depends on whether the government charges anyone .\nIf a person is charged and acquitted , and law enforcement unlawfully obtained evidence against that person , his remedy is either persuading the court to suppress the evidence thus resulting in the acquittal , or suing the law enforcement agents who unlawfully spied on him .\nYet , under current Supreme Court decisions about who can sue the government , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and not charged you and not told you , you have no cause of action against the law enforcement agents who did this .\nStated differently , in 2019 , at least 760,739 people in America were spied upon pursuant to judicial orders allegedly based upon probable cause of crime and were neither charged nor informed of the spying .\nMy Fox colleagues often

are Counted, the American Police State Will Continue", "content": "The American people remain eager to be persuaded that a new president in the White House can solve the problems that plague us .\nYet no matter who wins this presidential election , you can rest assured that the new boss will be the same as the old boss , and we\u2014the permanent underclass in America\u2014will continue to be forced to march in lockstep with the police state in all matters , public and private .\nIndeed , it really doesn \u2019 t matter what you call them\u2014the Deep State , the 1 % , the elite , the controllers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the police state , the surveillance state , the military industrial complex\u2014so long as you understand that no matter which party occupies the White House in 2021 , the unelected bureaucracy that actually calls the shots will continue to do so .\nIn the interest of liberty and truth , here are a few hard truths about life in the American police state that will persist no matter who wins the 2020 presidential election .\nIndeed , these issues persisted\u2014and in many cases flourished\u2014under both Republican and Democratic administrations in recent years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to federal grant programs allowing the Pentagon to transfer surplus military supplies and weapons to local law enforcement agencies without charge , police forces will continue to be transformed from peace officers to heavily armed extensions of the military , complete with jackboots , helmets , shields , batons , pepper-spray , stun guns , assault rifles , body armor , miniature tanks and weaponized drones .\n\u201c Today , 17,000 local police forces are equipped with such military equipment as Blackhawk helicopters , machine guns , grenade launchers , battering rams , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , night vision , rappelling gear and armored vehicles , \u201d stated Paul Craig Roberts , former Assistant Secretary of the Treasury .\n\u201c Some have tanks.\n\u201d Overcriminalization will continue .\nIn the face of a government bureaucracy consumed with churning out laws , statutes , codes and regulations that reinforce its powers and value systems and those of the police state and its corporate allies , we will all continue to be viewed as petty criminals , guilty of violating some minor law .\nThanks to an overabundance of 4,500-plus federal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is estimated that the average American actually commits three felonies a day without knowing it .\nIn fact , according to law professor John Baker , \u201c There is no one in the United States over the age of 18 who can not be indicted for some federal crime.\n\u201d Consequently , we now find ourselves operating in a strange new world where small farmers who dare to make unpasteurized goat cheese and share it with members of their community are finding their farms raided , while home gardeners face jail time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of orchids without having completed sufficient paperwork .\nThis frightening state of affairs\u2014where a person can actually be arrested and incarcerated for the most innocent and inane activities , including feeding a whale and collecting rainwater on their own property\u2014is due to what law scholars refer to as overcriminalization .\nJailing Americans for profit will continue .\nAt one time , the American penal system operated under the idea that dangerous criminals needed to be put under lock and key in order to protect society .\nToday , as states attempt to save @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , imprisoning Americans in private prisons run by mega-corporations has turned into a cash cow for big business .\nIn exchange for corporations buying and managing public prisons across the country at a supposed savings to the states , the states have to agree to maintain a 90 % occupancy rate in the privately run prisons for at least 20 years .\nSuch a scheme simply encourages incarceration for the sake of profits , while causing millions of Americans , most of them minor , nonviolent criminals , to be handed over to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nothing to protect society or prevent recidivism .\nThus , although the number of violent crimes in the country is down substantially , the number of Americans being jailed for nonviolent crimes such as driving with a suspended license is skyrocketing .\nPoverty will continue .\nDespite the fact that we have 46 million Americans living at or below the poverty line , 16 million children living in households without adequate access to food , and at least 900,000 veterans relying on food stamps ( mind you , these are pre-COVID numbers , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pandemic ) , enormous sums continue to be doled out for presidential excursions ( taxpayers have been forced to pay at least $ 100 million so that Donald Trump could visit his golf clubs and private properties more than 500 times during his four years in office ) .\nEndless wars that enrich the military industrial complex will continue .\nHaving been co-opted by greedy defense contractors , corrupt politicians and incompetent government officials , America \u2019 s expanding military empire is bleeding the country dry at a rate of more than $ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 20 million an hour ) \u2014and that \u2019 s just what the government spends on foreign wars .\nThat does not include the cost of maintaining and staffing the 1000-plus U.S. military bases spread around the globe .\nIncredibly , although the U.S. constitutes only 5 % of the world \u2019 s population , America boasts almost 50 % of the world \u2019 s total military expenditure , spending more on the military than the next 19 biggest spending nations combined .\nIn fact , the Pentagon spends more on war than all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ education , welfare , and safety .\nYet what most Americans fail to recognize is that these ongoing wars have little to do with keeping the country safe and everything to do with enriching the military industrial complex at taxpayer expense .\nConsider that since 2001 , Americans have spent $ 10.5 million every hour for numerous foreign military occupations , including in Iraq and Afghanistan .\nPolice shootings of unarmed Americans will continue .\nNo matter what our party politics , race , religion , or any other distinction used to divide @ @ @ @ @ @ @ becomes the government \u2019 s calling card .\nRemember , in a police state , you \u2019 re either the one with your hand on the trigger or you \u2019 re staring down the barrel of a loaded gun .\nAt least 400 to 500 innocent people are killed by police officers every year .\nIndeed , Americans are now eight times more likely to die in a police confrontation than they are to be killed by a terrorist .\nAmericans are 110 times more likely to die of foodborne illness than in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more likely to be struck by lightning than be made financially liable for their wrongdoing .\nAs a result , Americans are largely powerless in the face of militarized police .\nSWAT team raids will continue .\nMore than 80,000 SWAT team raids are carried out every year on unsuspecting Americans for relatively routine police matters .\nNationwide , SWAT teams have been employed to address an astonishingly trivial array of criminal activity or mere community nuisances including angry dogs , domestic disputes , improper paperwork filed by an orchid farmer , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brief sampling .\nOn an average day in America , over 100 Americans have their homes raided by SWAT teams .\nThere has been a notable buildup in recent years of SWAT teams within non-security-related federal agencies such as the Department of Agriculture , the Railroad Retirement Board , the Tennessee Valley Authority , the Office of Personnel Management , the Consumer Product Safety Commission , the U.S .\nFish and Wildlife Service , and the Education Department .\nThe government \u2019 s war on the American people will continue .\n\u201c We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the rule of law .\nWhile the First Amendment\u2014which gives us a voice\u2014is being muzzled , the Fourth Amendment\u2014which protects us from being bullied , badgered , beaten , broken and spied on by government agents\u2014is being disemboweled .\nConsequently , you no longer have to be poor , black or guilty to be treated like a criminal in America .\nAll that is required is that you belong to the suspect class\u2014that is , the citizenry\u2014of the American police state .\nAs a de facto member of this so-called criminal class @ @ @ @ @ @ @ until proven innocent .\nThe oppression and injustice\u2014be it in the form of shootings , surveillance , fines , asset forfeiture , prison terms , roadside searches , and so on\u2014will come to all of us eventually unless we do something to stop it now .\nGovernment corruption will continue .\nThe government is not our friend .\nNor does it work for \u201c we the people.\n\u201d Americans instinctively understand this .\nWhen asked to name the greatest problem facing the nation , Americans of all political stripes ranked the government as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , almost eight out of ten Americans believe that government corruption is widespread .\nOur so-called government representatives do not actually represent us , the citizenry .\nWe are now ruled by an oligarchic elite of governmental and corporate interests whose main interest is in perpetuating power and control .\nCongress is dominated by a majority of millionaires who are , on average , fourteen times wealthier than the average American .\nThe rise of the surveillance state will continue .\nGovernment eyes are watching you .\nThey see your every move : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spend , where you go , with whom you interact , when you wake up in the morning , what you \u2019 re watching on television and reading on the internet .\nEvery move you make is being monitored , mined for data , crunched , and tabulated in order to form a picture of who you are , what makes you tick , and how best to control you when and if it becomes necessary to bring you in line .\nPolice have been outfitted with a litany of surveillance gear , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tracking devices to biometric data recorders .\nTechnology now makes it possible for the police to scan passersby in order to detect the contents of their pockets , purses , briefcases , etc .\nFull-body scanners , which perform virtual strip-searches of Americans traveling by plane , have gone mobile , with roving police vans that peer into vehicles and buildings alike\u2014including homes .\nCoupled with the nation \u2019 s growing network of real-time surveillance cameras and facial recognition software , soon there really will be nowhere to run and nowhere to hide @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will continue .\nDue in large part to rapid advances in technology and a heightened surveillance culture , the burden of proof has been shifted so that the right to be considered innocent until proven guilty has been usurped by a new norm in which all citizens are suspects .\nThis is exemplified by police practices of stopping and frisking people who are merely walking down the street and where there is no evidence of wrongdoing .\nMaking matters worse are Terrorism Liaison Officers ( firefighters , police officers , and even corporate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spy on their fellow citizens and report \u201c suspicious activity , \u201d which includes taking pictures with no apparent aesthetic value , making measurements and drawings , taking notes , conversing in code , espousing radical beliefs and buying items in bulk .\nTLOs report back to \u201c fusion centers , \u201d which are a driving force behind the government \u2019 s quest to collect , analyze , and disseminate information on American citizens .\nGovernment tyranny under the reign of an Imperial President will continue .\nThe Constitution invests the President with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ serve as Commander in Chief of the military , grant pardons , make treaties ( with the approval of Congress ) , appoint ambassadors and federal judges ( again with Congress \u2019 blessing ) , and veto legislation .\nIn recent years , however , American presidents have anointed themselves with the power to wage war , unilaterally kill Americans , torture prisoners , strip citizens of their rights , arrest and detain citizens indefinitely , carry out warrantless spying on Americans , and erect their own secretive , shadow government .\nThe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inherited by each successive president\u2014powers which add up to a toolbox of terror for an imperial ruler\u2014empower whomever occupies the Oval Office to act as a dictator , above the law and beyond any real accountability .\nThe grim reality we must come to terms with is the fact that the government does whatever it wants , freedom be damned .\nMore than terrorism , more than domestic extremism , more than gun violence and organized crime , the U.S. government has become a greater menace to the life , liberty and property @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so-called dangers from which the government claims to protect us .\nThis state of affairs has become the status quo , no matter which party is in power .\nThe government \u2019 s manipulation of national crises in order to expand its powers will continue .\n\u201c We the people \u201d have been the subjected to an \u201c emergency state \u201d that justifies all manner of government tyranny and power grabs in the so-called name of national security .\nWhatever the so-called threat to the nation\u2014whether it \u2019 s civil unrest , school @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or the threat of a global pandemic in the case of COVID-19\u2014the government has a tendency to capitalize on the nation \u2019 s heightened emotions , confusion and fear as a means of extending the reach of the police state .\nIndeed , the government \u2019 s answer to every problem continues to be more government\u2014at taxpayer expense\u2014and less individual liberty .\nThe bottom line is this : nothing taking place on Election Day will alleviate the suffering of the American people .\nUnless we do something more than vote , the government @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , bloated and controlled by big-money corporations , lobbyists and special interest groups\u2014will remain unchanged .\nAnd \u201c we the people \u201d \u2014overtaxed , overpoliced , overburdened by big government , underrepresented by those who should speak for us and blissfully ignorant of the prison walls closing in on us\u2014will continue to trudge along a path of misery .\nAs I point out in my book Battlefield America : The War on the American People , these problems will continue to plague our nation unless and until Americans wake up to the fact @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who can change things for the better and then do something about it .\nIf there is to be any hope of restoring our freedoms and reclaiming control over our government , it will rest not with the politicians but with the people themselves .\nAfter all , Indeed , the Constitution opens with those three vital words , \u201c We the people.\n\u201d What the founders wanted us to understand is that we are the government .\nThere is no government without us\u2014our sheer numbers , our muscle , our economy , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There can also be no police state\u2014no tyranny\u2014no routine violations of our rights without our complicity and collusion\u2014without

for the 2020 presidential election are currently being tallied .\nThe arrests came within hours of two bomb threats , after police had received a tip about a group coming from Virginia with plans to \u201c attack the Convention Center.\n\u201d Philadelphia police said that security in the Fashion District mall received two calls from the same individual saying that a bomb was going to go off

called in .\nPhiladelphia District Attorney Larry Krasner said that police spotted a silver Hummer SUV with Virginia tags parked near the building while they were on high alert after the threat

to help because the changes can not be undone .\nEach injection will be credited to a health-pass app on your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ identity , which you could need just to leave the house by the time the vax are ready in a year or two .\nThe risks boil down to your own individual set of genes , your level of health , and the vaccine in question .\nBut it \u2019 ll probably be a genetic vaccine , with powerful , equally unlicensed , additives , because those are the ones that \u2019 ll be ready first , and they \u2019 re already mostly paid for .\nThis article will explain the basic types @ @ @ @ @

look at some of the new adjuvants being added to the ronavax , but there \u2019 s so much to say , there will be two extra articles to cover it properly !\nA vector is what \u2019 s used to contain

\u2019 s added .\nIt \u2019 s also a question of just how new they are , because there is a lot of information about the use of viral and plasmid vectors , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ terms of the additives ( adjuvants ) , most of them haven \u2019 t been licensed before , so information on those is also limited .\nHowever , lipid nanoparticles have been used for over a decade , and they don \u2019 t have

on everyone being bamboozled !\nVIRUSES AND PLASMIDS AS VECTORS @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vectors for gene delivery , lots of other viruses are used too .\nSome being used for ronavax include measles , rabies and parainfluenza viruses .\nEarly clinical trials using adenoviral vectors had to be scrapped , \u201c because of acute inflammatory responses and toxicity \u201d : \u201c \u2026 .\nSince Edward Tatum \u2019 s initial proposal to repurpose viruses for therapeutic gene delivery in 1966 \u2026 .\ngene therapy has experienced a few undesired clinical outcomes due to off-target effects , cytotoxicity , viral transmissibility , impurity , and an immune response @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Because it often uses repurposed viruses to deliver therapeutic genes , gene therapy has been caught in a vicious cycle \u2026 .\nowing to immune response , insertional mutagenesis , viral tropism , off-target activity , unwanted clinical outcomes ( ranging from illness to death of participants in clinical trials ) , and patchy regulations.\n\u201d A virus is a tiny piece of genetic code , smaller than bacteria .\nIt \u2019 s not alive , so it doesn \u2019 t reproduce .\n; instead , it replicates inside cells .\nThe synthetic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be \u2018 non-replicating \u2019 , although the FDA advises the gene therapy industry to monitor adenoviruses in cell substrates during production to see if some of them are becoming replication competent \u201c as a result of recombination between the vector genome and the cellular genome.\n\u201d Another potential problem with viral vectors is they could undergo changes which make them revert back to their original \u2018 virulent \u2019 form .\n\u201c An example of virulence reversion was documented with the use of recombinant vaccinia\u2013rabies glycoprotein virus vaccine prepared for wild raccoons and foxes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with this live , recombinant rabies\u2013vaccinia virus when it contacted her open wound.\n\u201d With both adenoviruses and bacterial plasmids , there is a risk of integration of vaccine DNA in the host genome .\nAnd according to the WHO , \u201c Bacterial DNA can promote the production of IgG anti-DNA auto-antibodies \u201d , which is associated with the development of auto-immune diseases such as lupus .\nAn article published in Nature said the adenovirus may cause , \u201c a significant number of cells [ to ] acquire genome-integrated vector fragments \u201d and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the integration of vector sequences into the host-cell genome \u201d .\nThe World Health Organisation also warns that bits of foreign DNA can find their way into the vaccine during production : \u201c Theoretically , the introduction of extraneous DNA \u2026 .\ncould cause a transformation event leading to the formation of tumour cells \u201d .\nSynthetic genes could become inserted into your genome , or into the micro-organisms that live inside you , leading to mutations .\nAlternatively , you might have a genetic susceptibility to one or more diseases , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u2019 .\nFor instance , as noted by the FDA , antibiotic resistance genes could be transferred by the vaccines , as can happen after eating GM food .\nAll of the genetic vaccines are a pick \u2018 n \u2019 mix assortment of genetics .\nJ & J \u2019 s ronavax , for example , uses a bacterial plasmid to create an adenovirus , into which they insert a \u2018 transgene expression cassette \u2019 .\nEverything gets messed around with \u2013 the adenovirus genome has bits removed and replaced , e.g .\nwith @ @ @ @ @ @ @ combined with \u201c the human cytomegalovirus promoter and the SV-40 polyadenylation sequence \u201d .\nThis concoction is \u2018 expressed \u2019 in human cells ( called PER.C6 ) , obtained from an aborted human foetus .\n\u201c Every person , reagent , and piece of equipment in the laboratory is a potential vehicle for invasive microbes , unwelcome cells and chemical impurities \u2026.. pathogens carried by cells ( either intentionally or accidentally ) or in components of the culture medium are potential health hazards , and laboratory-acquired viral infections have been reported.\n\u201d It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get into vaccines without being detected .\nThis happened in a recent gen-vax trial for HIV \u2013 the vaccine was eventually found to be contaminated with mycobacteria .\nIn fact , \u201c it is estimated that 5 \u2013 30 % of all cell cultures today are contaminated with mycoplasma species alone .\nIncidence of viral contamination of common cell lines exceeded 25 % in one study , and non-cytopathic viruses are even more likely than mycoplasma to escape detection , as culture health may not provide clues to their presence.\n\u201d And who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ?\nThis is such a new industry , and it lacks manufacturing experience and the right kind of staff \u2013 so how will they find qualified technicians , and who will provide oversight ?\nThis is where things start to get even murkier \u2026 it takes us into the realm of genetics again , because now some additives are just genetic code .\nAnd some of them mess around with DNA so much that they stray into the world of XNA , a reinvented version of DNA never seen in nature \u2026 which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ comes to putting something inside your cells !\nAdjuvants are substances designed to aggravate the immune system into reacting more .\nSome of the ronavax contain alum , which has been used in conventional vaccines for decades , and linked to many side effects .\nBut the main genetic ronavax contain a range of novel substances for people to contend with , any of which could cause adverse side effects .\nSome of them are encoded with molecular adjuvants , i.e .\nthey contain signalling molecules such as \u201c cytokines , chemokines , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or inhibitors of immune suppressive pathways .\nNew approaches including gene knockdown , epigenetics and systems biology have also contributed to an increased range of molecular adjuvant options.\n\u201d Patents include long lists of additives you wouldn \u2019 t dream of , such as cholera toxin , protamine , flagellin , and human genes .\nEven the vector can be an adjuvant : bacterial plasmids and lipid nanoparticles , used to contain mRNA stimulate the immune system into reacting .\nAs mentioned above , lipid nanoparticles have already been used as an adjuvant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to hundreds of young people developing narcolepsy after getting the Pandemrix vaccine in 2009 .\n( This will be covered more in a separate article . )\nElectroporation ( EP ) involves passing an electric current through the tissue , straight after injection of a DNA plasmid vax .\nIt \u2019 s needed to break down the cell walls so the plasmid can get in , but can lead to cell death ( i.e .\nirreversible EP ) .\nIt can induce muscle contractions , and damage the skin and tissue , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nDNA uses adenine , thymine , guanine , and cytosine , while RNA uses uracil instead of thymine .\nHowever , producing genetic code is neither simple nor \u2018 clean \u2019 .\nThe process of making it useable is long and complicated , requiring various reagents , heat , etc .\nCell lines used to produce recombinant vaccines require a broth to feed and maintain them , and can require up to fifty ingredients , such as \u201c growth factors , amino acids , reducing agents , or vitamins.\n\u201d Some gen-vax @ @ @ @ @ @ @ HEK-293 , and J & J \u2019 s PER.C6 ) , HeLa cells ( immortal cancer cells from a woman \u2019 s cervix ) and Vero cells ( from a monkey \u2019 s kidney ) .\nGen-vax using mRNA are said to avoid use of these cells , but to make mRNA , a bacterial plasmid is used to transcribe the mRNA from DNA .\nCurevac , who are also making a ronavax , describe this process in their patent for a MERS coronavirus vaccine .\nPlasmid DNA constructs were transformed and propagated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an E. coli gene and a polymerase from a bacteriophage .\nWhat about the microchip ?\nThere \u2019 s no point putting a microchip or metallic nanoparticles in the vaccine because it \u2019 s not possible to control where they end up .\nThey would get lodged in body tissues and be mostly unreadable .\nAn RFID chip needs to be implanted just under the skin , using a special needle .\nBesides , they only work on things up close , so they \u2019 re not much use .\nSmartphones , on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ID , GPS tracking , accelerometer , gyroscope , biometrics , apps , and \u2018 rechargability \u2019 .\nYou look after your own slavery device .\nOnce the global ID system is established , in line with the blockchain and digital Global Credits , more people will choose to pop a tag in their hand to link with their ID-protected smart devices .\nSome people might wear a wristlet to measure galvanic skin response for extra credits .\nBoth the microchip and the wristlet could be used for geo-fencing or people separation purposes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ early stages of development , and very expensive , whilst sterilization has to target the cells involved in reproduction .\nVaccines containing gonadotropin don \u2019 t seem to create lasting contraception , although research published in 2018 reports that a DNA vaccine led to \u201c suppression of testosterone and impaired fertility in immunized mice \u201d .\nNo matter what \u2019 s in the ronavax , though , they mean risking your health and signing up for slavery .\nBecause the two are planned to go hand-in-hand \u2013 you \u2019 d need both the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ outside of your house , and avoid the isolation camps .\nThere have already been two cases of an MS-like disease called transverse myelitis reported in AstraZeneca \u2019 s ronavax trials .\nDid something in the vaccine trigger a genetic predisposition in these individuals ?\nJohnson and Johnson use the adenovirus in their ronavax , too , and also halted the trial when someone had a sufficiently adverse reaction , but both companies are soon to resume the trials .\n\u201c In the Johnson & Johnson trial , which was paused on Oct. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vaccination suffered a stroke that may have been triggered by an infection .\nTo conclude it was not likely to be related to the shot , investigators probed not only the medical details of the event , but also examined a safety database of 100,000 people who have received vaccines that use the same underlying technology .\nThe investigation found \u201c no clear cause \u201d of the incident , according to a company statement .\nIt also found no evidence the vaccine triggered the event , the details of which were not disclosed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ & J said that although \u201c no clear cause has been identified \u201d , they had \u201c found no evidence that the vaccine candidate caused the event.\n\u201d Having \u2018 no clear cause \u2019 does not rule out the possibility it was connected to the vaccine .\nViruses and bacteria affect each other so what infection did the person have ?\nThe interplay between organisms can affect whether or not you end up getting ill when pathogens compete inside you , so it deserves much more investigation .\nThe reliance on data from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is also a concern \u2013 did they have the same vaccines ?\nOr the same vectors , adjuvants , and dose ?\nHave any long term studies on the genetic effects of such vaccines ever been done ?\nOne of the selling points of gen-vax is that they are \u2018 plug-and-play \u2019 platform vaccines , which can be manufactured very quickly .\nSo if a pandemic occurred , a new genetic sequence could be knocked up in no time on a computer , popped in an \u2018 expression cassette \u2019 , and used @ @ @ @ @ @ @ produced .\nSo , as long as the factory lines are rolling , with whatever platform is being used , Big BioPharma can come to the rescue .\nThere have been a lot of trials of genetic vaccines already , so it helps to see what happened in those .\nFor instance , a tuberculosis vaccine using the same ChAdOx1 vector that \u2019 s in AstraZeneca \u2019 s ronavax , was trialled in 42 healthy UK adults .\nThere were four severe systemic AEs ( e.g .\nfatigue , feverishness and headache ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blood abnormalities ) which were all deemed related , e.g .\nlymphopaenia , neutropaenia , and leukopaenia .\nOne person reported transient axillary lymphadenopathy ( changes in lymph nodes ) ; another person \u201c had a moderate lymphopaenia \u2026 which was ongoing at the end of the study \u201d , i.e .\nthey hadn \u2019 t got better .\nParexel and Moderna trialled the H10N8 flu vaccine ( mRNA-1440 ) which found that of the 145 people dosed , there were 124 unsolicited AEs , including upper respiratory tract infection , back pain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There were also five severe AEs ( erythema , headache , back pain , tonsillitis , and ruptured ovarian cyst ) and two serious AEs , cholecystitis ( inflammation of the gallbladder ) and ruptured ovarian cyst ( it \u2019 s not clear if this happened to one person twice , or to two people ) .\nMost of these AEs were deemed unrelated to mRNA-1440 .\nAnother Moderna vaccine , this time for Human Metapneumovirus and Parainfluenza Virus 3 ( mRNA-1653 ) , was trialled in Texas and Nebraska .\nThere were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of just 94 people , none of which were \u2018 solicited \u2019 symptoms .\nModerna advise that their vaccine platform , \u201c may induce immune reactions from either the mRNA or the lipid as well as adverse reactions within liver pathways or degradation of the mRNA or the LNP , any of which could lead to significant adverse events in one or more of our clinical trials .\nMany of these types of side effects have been seen for legacy LNPs.\n\u201d Moderna is currently trialling a Zika vaccine on babies , beginning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Use of an adenovirus in a gene therapy trial in 1999 led to the death of a young man called Jesse Gelsinger , just four days after the injection .\nHe was only 18 , and he wasn \u2019 t told that two lab monkeys had already died , and previous volunteers also had adverse reactions .\nAfterwards , \u201c the FDA and NIH revealed that 691 volunteers in gene-therapy experiments had either died or fallen ill in the seven years before Jesse \u2019 s death ; only 39 of these incidents had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of gamma retroviruses as vectors led to , \u201c cases of leukaemia after X-SCID gene therapy and the \u2026 .\ndeaths of some patients following gene therapy against Wiskott\u2013Aldrich syndrome \u201d .\nAnother patient , Jolee Mohr , aged 36 and suffering from rheumatoid arthritis , was injected with an adeno-associated vector ; she \u201c experienced vomiting and fever soon after the second injection \u201d , and died three weeks later .\nThis was deemed unrelated and the trial restarted .\nThe Parexel/TeGenero trial of TGN1412 involved administering monoclonal antibodies from a humanized @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a dose had \u201c the same kind of \u2018 cytokine storm \u2019 that had killed Jesse Gelsinger .\nTheir heads and bodies grotesquely swollen , they were rushed into intensive care.\n\u201d They never fully recovered and are \u201c considered to remain at high risk of cancer and immune-system disturbances \u201d .\nThis trial also highlights another problem with gen-vax : animal models aren \u2019 t much use .\nTheir genetics are different to ours .\nAn inquiry into what went wrong found that tests on animals hadn \u2019 t helped them to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nHumans are not like macaques , it turns out .\nSometimes we \u2019 re more like chimpanzees , leading to \u201c differences in T cell activation and cytokine release \u201d , for example .\nThe thing about the gen-vax trials that have taken place in the past is that they have been judged in the same way as traditional vaccines and drugs .\nDespite the WHO commenting that , \u201c Classical safety or toxicological testing , as recommended for chemical drugs , will have limited application to a plasmid DNA product \u201d @ @ @ @ @ @ @ accordingly .\nThere seem to be no long term follow-ups , no checks on genetic effects , no apparent oversight , and no apparent regard for the potential effects on other people , or the environment .\nNonetheless , key players in the global reset , including the World Bank , United Nations , World Economic Forum , and nation states , are pushing very hard for us to accept the coronavirus vaccines .\nAt the start of 2020 , there were a lot of failed genetic vaccines and no licenses , so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up our sleeves and get the app in blind faith ?\nAn easy-to-catch global infection like the rona is just what was needed to get these things up and running , because , to get licensed , they need lots of healthy people to take part in trials , and a virus that \u2019 s everywhere so they can use their slick tests to \u2018 prove \u2019 the vaccine works .\nUp until this year , all they had was very sick people with cancer , etc.\n, and a handful of trials @ @ @ @ @ @ @ diseases like Ebola and malaria .\nIn January , it was said the FDA expected to receive 200 applications in 2020 for gene therapy products , and to approve up to twenty products a year by 2025 , but there was still \u201c no way to reliably scale up production \u201d , and even the largest facilities built by Gilead and Novartis could only produce a few hundred doses per year .\nThis made gene therapy too expensive .\nNow , however , production capacity is booming globally .\nRegular vaccination of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ treatments and blood plasma products .\nTeam Reset sees you as a piece of meat , and they want every pound of flesh accounted for .\nLife on the farm means behaving as required and keeping fit , to keep the system \u2018 balanced \u2019 for the circular economy .\nThe ronavax are just to get the ball rolling \u2013 synthetic genetic monstrosities and the patenting of everything you once knew and loved are but one step away .\nAll that \u2019 s needed now is a quick side-step of the Nagoya and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ CBD .\nSee Part 1 : We

.\nAllow me to expand on this .\nWhat is the same ?\nThe purpose of all elections is to allow a band of people called the state to legitimize their claim of control over everyone and everything within a given jurisdiction .\nIn his book The Rise and Fall of Society , the Old Right libertarian Frank Chodorov defines the state as \u201c a number of people who , having somehow got hold of it , \u201d use \u201c the machinery @ @ @ @ @ @ @ might pursue their version of happiness without respect to the discipline of the market place \u201d ( italics added ) .\nThe two somehows of getting and holding political power are to use institutionalized violence or to convince people to respect state authority .\nStatists usually pursue some combination of both .\nViolence is rarely preferred , however , because it can backlash into a resistance that threatens state power .\nIt is far better for the state if people oppress themselves through willing obedience .\nIt is even better if they express @ @ @ @ @ @ @ politicians and the media applaud the rah-rah attitude of cheering crowds who characterize elections .\nThus voting is deified as the voice of \u201c the people , \u201d a fundamental right , and the best way to change society .\nThe situation is the opposite of what the state claims .\nThe anarchist author Albert Jay Nock divided power into two categories : social and state .\nSocial power is the freedom individuals exercise over their lives ; when people gather for mutual benefit and when a society forms , this is also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ control government exercises over individuals and society ; it preys upon them\u2014through taxation , for example\u2014to enrich itself .\nAn inverse and antagonistic relationship exists between the two types of power , with the state expanding only at the expense of society and vice versa .\nFreedom does not and can not come from elections that strengthen the state \u2019 s perceived legitimacy ; freedom depends on weakening this authority , preferably down to zero .\nThe popular celebration of the \u201c right \u201d to vote puzzled Nock and Chodorov .\nIn his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , The answer : people do so because they believe elections and the state are necessary evils .\nDespite the presence of far more effective strategies\u2014education and agorism are only two\u2014people see no other effective alternatives for social change or stability .\nSo far in the analysis , election 2020 is the same as every other election ; only circumstances like voter turnout are unusual .\nWhat is different ?\nThe state \u2019 s mask of legitimacy is slipping .\nElection 2020 is rife with Republican cries of \u201c Fraud !\n\u201d As @ @ @ @ @ @ @ alarm bells about the mail-in ballots demanded by Democrats , calling them \u201c horrible \u201d and \u201c corrupt , \u201d with \u201c tremendous potential for voter fraud.\n\u201d Democrats counterattacked by accusing Republicans of destroying democracy by delegitimizing the election .\nThe Democrats are correct about Republicans damaging democracy but wrong about their glorification of mob rule and blind to their own role in the political carnage .\nLike the state , democracy is accepted only in the minds of people who believe in the system .\nA flood of news stories about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whether or not the stories are true ; discarded ballots , dishonest counts , lack of oversight , slack verification , ballot harvesting , and voter suppression have caused lawsuits and protests to erupt across America .\nBut is election 2020 any more rigged than some past ones ?\nA 2016 article in the Daily Signal , \u201c Rigged Election ?\nPast Presidential Contests Sowed Doubt and Nearly Led to Violence , \u201d lists five presidential races that are viewed as having been won through fraud .\nAnd the problem is not confined @ @ @ @ @ @ @ article , \u201c Don \u2019 t Forget LBJ \u2019 s Election Theft , \u201d by Jacob Hornberger of the Future of Freedom Foundation , recounted the incredible corruption of Lyndon B. Johnson \u2019 s senatorial race .\nNevertheless , the iniquities of this election seem to be unusually widespread and transparent .\nSeveral factors undoubtedly contribute to the more conspicuous abuse .\n\u2022 Many on the left and in the media passionately hate Trump , whom they view as a woman-bashing , homophobic racist .\nRacism is the worst sin in our culture @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shed all pretense of fairness toward him .\nFor his part , Trump stokes the fire through caustic tweets and comments .\n\u2022 Some campaign veterans on the left may have sensed the Democrats \u2019 weakness : Biden is a terrible candidate who is mentally deteriorating , hides in his basement , and can not draw a crowd .\nTo these Democrats , cheating may seem necessary .\n\u2022 Others on the left probably believed the polls , which made them cocky and careless .\nThey shouldn \u2019 t have been .\nJournalist @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , \u201c You have an incumbent President with a massive recession , an unemployment , rent and foreclosure crisis , and an out-of-control pandemic , and this is what the Democrats are able to do with it\u2026.Assuming that Biden ekes out a victory , that the Democrats managed to *lose* seats in the House with everything going on might be the most shocking and pathetic part of what happened.\n\u201d \u2022 Trump vows to dismantle the deep state .\nWhether he is sincere or capable of doing so is debatable .\nThere is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has exposed some formidable deep state enemies and wants them punished .\nThe accused , like former director of national intelligence James Clapper , want blood , and they do not play by the rules .\n\u2022 A Trump administration would pursue the Hunter Biden\u2013Burisma scandal , which is making other prominent figures very nervous .\nA Biden administration would make it go away .\n\u2022 The political storm reflects what is happening on the streets and in the culture .\nConstant protests and riots seem to fill the streets with tension and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a take-no-prisoners culture of moral outrage has spilled from campuses into the mainstream , using tactics of intimidation , rage , and violent confrontation .\n\u2022 Identity politics is a surging political approach .\nIt defines human beings by secondary characteristics like race and pits different groups into nonnegotiable conflict that blocks the possibility of civil discussion or action .\nElection 2020 did not provide a clear winner .\nThe contest de facto continues through lawsuits and court decisions .\nHere this election could be different from most others , although , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tie or disputed ballots prevent both candidates from reaching 270 electoral votes , then the House will decide who will be president .\nChad Pergram , the congressional correspondent for Fox News , explains , \u201c Congress must approve certificates of election from all 50 states.\n\u201d The \u201c crucial date is December 14 , dictated by an obscure , 1887 law\u2026The Electoral Count Act dictates that states choose electors no more than 41 days after the election .\nThis is partly why the Supreme Court rushed to complete Bush v. Gore on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ halted the count of ballots in Florida , handing the presidency to George W. Bush.\n\u201d Legal challenges to state elections may result in the same for Trump .\nIf Congress can not certify the electoral college votes , Pergram describes the next steps .\n\u201c If Congress determines there \u2019 s a stalemate , the 12th Amendment directs the House to elect the President .\nThis is called a \u2018 contingent election.\n\u2019 \u201d A delegate from each state casts one ballot .\nThe process would probably advantage Trump , as Republicans @ @ @ @ @ @ @ states .\n\u201c At this point , \u201d Pergram writes , \u201c we expect House Speaker Nancy Pelosi\u2026presuming she is re-elected , \u2026and Vice President Pence , in his capacity as President of the Senate , to co-preside over the Joint Session .\nPence \u2019 s term doesn \u2019 t expire until January 20 .\nAnd , the 12th Amendment\u2026mandates that \u2018 the President of the Senate shall , in the presence of the Senate and House of Representatives , open all the certificates and the votes shall be counted \u2019 .\n\u201d @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over which constitutional scholars have debated for years ; it does not specify how the votes are to be counted .\nPergram points to yet another possible obstacle .\n\u201c The 12th Amendment also says \u2018 the person having the greatest number of votes for President shall be President \u2019 .\nBut Congress must agree to all of this .\nAnd remember , Pence is the one running the show at this stage.\n\u201d In short , an incredible mess might well be followed by another incredible mess\u2014one that could set a constitutional @ @ @ @ @ @ @ proud to have played no part in the ugly fiasco of presidential election 2020 .\n\u201c A curse on both your houses \u201d is the sound libertarian position .\nWendy McElroy is a Canadian individualist anarchist and individualist feminist .\nShe was a cofounder along with Carl Watner and George H.

online communities .\nHowever , the coronavirus pandemic was not the only excuse employed by African governments .\nThere is a growing trend to instrumentalize school examinations and politically charged moments like mass protests and elections to stifle digital freedom .\nWith these growing authoritarian tendencies to switch off or throttle the internet , what is the social and political impact within each context and country ?\nHere \u2019 s a round-up of some of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : Algeria recorded a nationwide disruption of internet access on Sunday , September 13 , which left many users with \u201c unusably slow service for several days \u201d , reports NetBlocks .\nMore than half a million Algerian pupils started their baccalaureate exams on September 13 .\nThe internet restrictions were part of measures to restrict the distribution of leaked examination papers .\nThose not taking exams were still forced to bear the brunt of a digital blackout and this violation of

.\nInternet disruptions were also recorded during last year \u2019 s school examinations .\nThe cost of the shutdown this year hit an estimated $ 388 million United States dollars , states the Geneva Internet Platform , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ government disabled internet services on June 30 , following protests in the capital city of Addis Ababa , and other Ethiopian cities after the assassination of famous singer and activist Hachalu Hundessa .\nIn the wake of Hundessa \u2019 s murder , the nation struggled with violence that erupted along ethnic and religious lines .\nSocial media , particularly

asymmetric digital subscriber line @ @ @ @ @ @ @ via copper wire lines .\nOn July 16 , wireless broadband and ADSL services were partially restored .\nBut , since the majority of Ethiopians access the

nothing has really changed .\nThe U.S. government still poses the threat to our freedoms .\nMore than terrorism , more than domestic extremism , more than gun violence and organized crime , even more than the perceived threat posed by any single politician , the U.S. government remains a greater menace to the life , liberty and property of its citizens than any of the so-called dangers from which the government claims to protect us .\nThis threat is especially pronounced for America \u2019 s military veterans , especially that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ First Amendment right to speak out against government wrongdoing .\nConsider : we raise our young people on a steady diet of militarism and war , sell them on the idea that defending freedom abroad by serving in the military is their patriotic duty , then when they return home , bruised and battle-scarred and committed to defending their freedoms at home , we often treat them like criminals merely for exercising those rights they risked their lives to defend .\nThe government even has a name for its war on America \u2019 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ As first reported by the Wall Street Journal , this Department of Homeland Security ( DHS ) program tracks military veterans returning from Iraq and Afghanistan and characterizes them as extremists and potential domestic terrorist threats because they may be \u201c disgruntled , disillusioned or suffering from the psychological effects of war.\n\u201d Coupled with the DHS \u2019 dual reports on Rightwing and Leftwing \u201c Extremism , \u201d which broadly define extremists as individuals , military veterans and groups \u201c that are mainly antigovernment , rejecting federal authority in favor of state or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ entirely , \u201d these tactics bode ill for anyone seen as opposing the government .\nYet the government is not merely targeting individuals who are voicing their discontent so much as it is taking aim at individuals trained in military warfare .\nDon \u2019 t be fooled by the fact that the DHS has gone extremely quiet about Operation Vigilant Eagle .\nWhere there \u2019 s smoke , there \u2019 s bound to be fire .\nAnd the government \u2019 s efforts to target military veterans whose views may be perceived as \u201c @ @ @ @ @ @ @ afoot .\nIn recent years , military servicemen and women have found themselves increasingly targeted for surveillance , censorship , threatened with incarceration or involuntary commitment , labeled as extremists and/or mentally ill , and stripped of their Second Amendment rights .\nIn light of the government \u2019 s efforts to lay the groundwork to weaponize the public \u2019 s biomedical data and predict who might pose a threat to public safety based on mental health sensor data ( a convenient means by which to penalize certain \u201c unacceptable \u201d social behaviors ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even more deadly , especially if those involved have a mental illness or disability coupled with a military background .\nIncredibly , as part of a proposal being considered by the Trump Administration , a new government agency HARPA ( a healthcare counterpart to the Pentagon \u2019 s research and development arm DARPA ) will take the lead in identifying and targeting \u201c signs \u201d of mental illness or violent inclinations among the populace by using artificial intelligence to collect data from Apple Watches , Fitbits , Amazon Echo and Google Home .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ Many times throughout history in totalitarian regimes , such governments have declared dissidents mentally ill and unfit for society as a means of rendering them disempowering them .\nFor example , government officials in the Cold War-era Soviet Union often used psychiatric hospitals as prisons in order to isolate political prisoners from the rest of society , discredit their ideas , and break them physically and mentally through the use of electric shocks , drugs and various medical procedures .\nInsisting that \u201c ideas about a struggle for truth and justice are formed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u201d the psychiatric community actually went so far as to provide the government with a diagnosis suitable for locking up such freedom-oriented activists .\nIn addition to declaring political dissidents mentally unsound , Russian officials also made use of an administrative process for dealing with individuals who were considered a bad influence on others or troublemakers .\nThis age-old practice by which despotic regimes eliminate their critics or potential adversaries by declaring them mentally ill and locking them up in psychiatric wards for extended periods of time is a common practice in present-day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ however , is how this practice of eliminating or undermining potential critics , including military veterans , is happening with increasing frequency in the United States .\nRemember , the National Defense Authorization Act ( NDAA ) opened the door for the government to detain as a threat to national security anyone viewed as a troublemaker .\nAccording to government guidelines for identifying domestic extremists\u2014a word used interchangeably with terrorists\u2014technically , anyone exercising their First Amendment rights in order to criticize the government qualifies .\nIt doesn \u2019 t take much anymore to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ government database somewhere\u2014Main Core , for example\u2014that identifies and tracks individuals who aren \u2019 t inclined to march in lockstep to the government \u2019 s dictates .\nIn fact , as the Washington Post reports , communities are being mapped and residents assigned a color-coded threat score\u2014green , yellow or red\u2014so police are forewarned about a person \u2019 s potential inclination to be a troublemaker depending on whether they \u2019 ve had a career in the military , posted a comment perceived as threatening on Facebook , suffer from a particular medical condition @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who might have committed a crime .\nThe case of Brandon Raub is a prime example of Operation Vigilant Eagle in action .\nRaub , a 26-year-old decorated Marine , actually found himself interrogated by government agents about his views on government corruption , arrested with no warning , labeled mentally ill for subscribing to so-called \u201c conspiratorial \u201d views about the government , detained against his will in a psych ward for standing by his views , and isolated from his family , friends and attorneys .\nOn August 16 , 2012 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Secret Service and FBI agents arrived at Raub \u2019 s Virginia home , asking to speak with him about posts he had made on his Facebook page made up of song lyrics , political opinions and dialogue used in a political thriller virtual card game .\nAmong the posts cited as troublesome were lyrics to a song by a rap group and Raub \u2019 s views , shared increasingly by a number of Americans , that the 9/11 terrorist attacks were an inside job .\nAfter a brief conversation and without providing any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or reading him his rights , Raub was then handcuffed and transported to police headquarters , then to a medical center , where he was held against his will due to alleged concerns that his Facebook posts were \u201c terrorist in nature.\n\u201d Outraged onlookers filmed the arrest and posted the footage to YouTube , where it quickly went viral .\nMeanwhile , in a kangaroo court hearing that turned a deaf ear to Raub \u2019 s explanations about the fact that his Facebook posts were being read out of context , Raub @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u2019 further confinement in a psychiatric ward .\nThankfully , The Rutherford Institute came to Raub \u2019 s assistance , which combined with heightened media attention , brought about his release and may have helped prevent Raub from being successfully \u201c disappeared \u201d by the government .\nEven so , within days of Raub being seized and forcibly held in a VA psych ward , news reports started surfacing of other veterans having similar experiences .\n\u201c Oppositional defiance disorder \u201d ( ODD ) is another diagnosis being used against veterans who challenge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Martin explains , an ODD diagnosis Frankly , based on how well my personality and my military service in the U.S. Armed Forces fit with this description of \u201c oppositional defiance disorder , \u201d I \u2019 m sure there \u2019 s a file somewhere with my name on it .\nThat the government is using the charge of mental illness as the means by which to immobilize ( and disarm ) these veterans is diabolical .\nWith one stroke of a magistrate \u2019 s pen , these veterans are being declared mentally ill @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and stripped of their constitutional rights .\nIf it were just being classified as \u201c anti-government , \u201d that would be one thing .\nUnfortunately , anyone with a military background and training is also now being viewed as a heightened security threat by police who are trained to shoot first and ask questions later .\nFeeding this perception of veterans as ticking time bombs in need of intervention , the Justice Department launched a pilot program in 2012 aimed at training SWAT teams to deal with confrontations involving highly trained and often @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with military veterans often escalate very quickly into an explosive and deadly situation , especially when SWAT teams are involved .\nFor example , Jose Guerena , a Marine who served in two tours in Iraq , was killed after an Arizona SWAT team kicked open the door of his home during a mistaken drug raid and opened fire .\nThinking his home was being invaded by criminals , Guerena told his wife and child to hide in a closet , grabbed a gun and waited in the hallway to confront the intruders @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In fact , the safety was still on his gun when he was killed .\nThe SWAT officers , however , not as restrained , fired 70 rounds of ammunition at Guerena\u201423 of those bullets made contact .\nApart from his military background , Guerena had had no prior criminal record , and the police found nothing illegal in his home .\nJohn Edward Chesney , a 62-year-old Vietnam veteran , was killed by a SWAT team allegedly responding to a call that the Army veteran was standing in his San Diego apartment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rifle .\nSWAT officers locked down Chesney \u2019 s street , took up positions around his home , and fired 12 rounds into Chesney \u2019 s apartment window .\nIt turned out that the gun Chesney reportedly pointed at police from three stories up was a \u201c realistic-looking mock assault rifle.\n\u201d Ramon Hooks \u2019 encounter with a Houston SWAT team did not end as tragically , but it very easily could have .\nHooks , a 25-year-old Iraq war veteran , was using an air rifle gun for target practice outside when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shopping in the area , reported him as an active shooter .\nIt wasn \u2019 t long before the quiet neighborhood was transformed into a war zone , with dozens of cop cars , an armored vehicle and heavily armed police .\nHooks was arrested , his air rifle pellets and toy gun confiscated , and charges filed against him for \u201c criminal mischief.\n\u201d Given the government \u2019 s increasing view of veterans as potential domestic terrorists , it makes one think twice about government programs encouraging veterans to include a veterans @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ID cards .\nHailed by politicians as a way to \u201c make it easier for military veterans to access discounts from retailers , restaurants , hotels and vendors across the state , \u201d it will also make it that much easier for the government to identify and target veterans who dare to challenge the status quo .\nRemember : no one is spared in a police state .\nEventually , as I make clear in my book Battlefield America : The War on the American People , we all suffer the same fate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the government can \u2019 t be bothered to abide by its constitutional mandate to respect the citizenry \u2019 s rights\u2014whether it \u2019 s the right to be free from government surveillance and censorship , the right to due process and fair hearings , the right to be free from roadside strip searches and militarized police , or the right to peacefully assemble and protest and exercise our right to free speech\u2014then why should anyone expect the government to treat our nation \u2019 s veterans with respect and dignity ?\nIt \u2019 s time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the American people , and that includes military veterans .\nCertainly , veterans have enough physical and psychological war wounds to overcome without adding the government to the mix .\nAlthough the U.S. boasts more than 20 million veterans who have served in World War II through the present day , large numbers of veterans are impoverished , unemployed , traumatized mentally and physically , struggling with depression , suicide , and marital stress , homeless , subjected to sub-par treatment at clinics and hospitals , and left to molder while their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nAt least 60,000 veterans died by suicide between 2008 and 2017 .\nOn average , 6,000 veterans kill themselves every year , and the numbers are on the rise .\nThe plight of veterans today\u2014and their treatment at the hands of the U.S. government\u2014remains America \u2019 s badge of shame .\nSo here \u2019 s a suggestion : if you really want to do something to show your respect and appreciation for the nation \u2019 s veterans , why not skip the parades and the flag-waving and instead go exercise your rights\u2014the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pushing back against the government \u2019 s tyranny .\nIt \u2019 s time the rest of the nation did its part to safeguard the freedoms we too often take

American war on drugs .\nDrugs won .\nOregon moved to decriminalize all drugs , even hard ones like meth and heroin as five other states moved to legalize cannabis in some form .\nFast forward to this week and a top leader in the US House of Representatives announced that Congress will be holding a historic vote to end federal cannabis prohibition once and for all .\nAs the left and the right argue over which crazy old white man they want in the White House , laws @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u2014 are being passed and proposed that increase the freedom of all Americans and deal a death blow to the racist and violent war on drugs .\nAlthough the president-elect Joe Biden claimed he will \u201c pursue modest marijuana reform \u201d after he gets in the White House , these claims ring entirely hollow given his lust for locking brown and black people in cages in his past four decades in Washington .\nThe prohibition of cannabis is a major tool used by the police state to go after communities of color and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ preying on these groups will not give up that power easily which is why Biden has refused to even consider legalization .\nHowever , House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer ( D-MD ) confirmed on Monday that marijuana legalization is still on the table before the presidential transition and will get a vote in December .\nThe Marijuana Opportunity Reinvestment and Expungement ( MORE ) Act , was supposed to go up for a vote in September but was shelved by Democrats who were worried about how it would look to pass a legalization @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nWell , since that relief package never came , the MORE act is up for vote once more , and will take place next moth .\nThe MORE Act would remove cannabis from the Controlled Substances Act ( CSA ) .\nBut that is not all .\nIt would go one step further and seek to undo the horrific damage caused by the state \u2019 s war on this plant by expunging the records of those persecuted by cannabis prohibition .\nThe House will \u201c vote on the MORE Act to decriminalize @ @ @ @ @ @ @ offenses that have prevented many Americans from getting jobs , applying for credit and loans , and accessing opportunities that make it possible to get ahead in our economy , \u201d Hoyer said in a Dear Colleague letter to House members .\nFederally descheduling cannabis would have a massive effect on bringing cannabis prohibition to its knees .\nIt will also bring in revenue to cash strapped states who are going in debt amid COVID-19 lockdowns .\nAccording to the legislation , the act would : provide for expungement and resentencing of prior @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cannabis as a reason to deny access to benefits or citizenship status for immigrants .\nIt would also impose a five percent federal tax on the sales of marijuana products .\nSome of that revenue would be directed toward a new Opportunity Trust Fund aimed at supporting grant programs to provide job training and legal aid for people impacted by prohibition enforcement , loans for small marijuana businesses owned and controlled by socially and economically disadvantaged individuals and efforts to minimize barriers to licensing and employment in the legal industry .\nSome of @ @ @ @ @

understated .\nIt is also important to point out that this legislation was presented last year and approved by a majority in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a vote by Congress has been delayed multiple times .\nIn August , however , the organization formerly known as Law Enforcement Against Prohibition ( LEAP ) , now known as Law Enforcement Action Partnership , along with the National Black Police Association

.\nA record five states legalized cannabis in some form .\nMontana voted to legalize cannabis for those 21 and up , New Jersey , South Dakota , and Arizona also approved recreational use and

a vote to legalize nationally taking place next month in Congress .\nTelling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for possessing and selling a plant that has never killed anyone , is most certainly a massive step in the

in the political world @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to correct it .\nWith the passage of Proposition 207 ( the Smart and Safe Arizona Act ) on Nov 3rd , Arizona \u2019 s largest county , Maricopa , decided to make that move .\nThis week , Maricopa County Attorney \u2019 s Office ( MCAO ) stated that it will go ahead and begin dismissing \u201c all pending and unfiled charges of possession of marijuana \u201d as

endorse any candidate for president or any other political office .\nThis article is presented for informational purposes only and all opinions are the author \u2019 s alone .\nRegardless of where one falls politically , the sanctity of the vote is a bedrock of a functioning representative democracy .\nVoters have to believe their vote matters .\nAnd that the vote is free , fair , and accurate .\nThe basic facts of the 2020 American Presidential election are concerning because mounting evidence indicates there \u2019 s been a concerted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the election from President Donald Trump to former Vice President Joe Biden in a number of key swing states with the help of notoriously corrupt Democratic Party machines in at least five American cities \u2014 Detroit , Milwaukee , Philadelphia , Pittsburg , and Atlanta .\nHere are the basic facts of the case : On Election Night when America went to bed , President Trump had a commanding lead in virtually every swing state , as well as Virginia , which no one expected him to win .\nHowever , when America @ @ @ @ @ @ @ found that he \u2019 d lost these leads , largely on the basis of mail-in ballots found in the middle of the night and out from under the watchful eye of legal election monitors .\nWhat \u2019 s more , these massive caches of votes \u2013 almost all of which were for former Vice President Biden \u2013 came via large dumps primarily from the five aforementioned cities in states predominantly run by Democratic governors .\nWhen one looks at the statistical likelihood of the reported turnout , the numbers are so improbable they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one-party state like Saddam Hussein \u2019 s Iraq or North Korea .\nWhat \u2019 s more , Biden \u2019 s victory does not square with the results of the Republican Party nationally : Republicans won 28 of 29 competitive House seats and Democrats were unable to flip a single state legislature .\nJoe Biden secured a scant three of the so-called \u201c Bellwether Districts \u201d that almost always choose the winner , one of which was in Delaware .\nJudicial Watch found 353 counties in 29 different states who had higher than 100 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tend to follow Florida in terms of swinging left or right .\nThis is particularly true in Michigan , which has voted in lockstep with Florida since 1968 .\nNearly three dozen states had counting machines connected to the Internet during the election , which is inherently insecure .\nJoe Biden \u2019 s lead among mail-in ballots was massive in two states \u2014 Michigan and Pennsylvania \u2014 while it was in the single digits in most states .\nEvidence of chicanery , irregularities , and outright manipulation have poured in from a variety @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Georgia , Wisconsin , North Carolina , Texas , New Jersey , Nevada , and Arizona .\nThis evidence could easily be dismissed as simply weird if one is being generous or naive .\nWhile much of this took place at the state level , there are also irregularities that are occurring across state lines and these are worthy of consideration .\nIt \u2019 s not evidence per se , but there was a massive spike in the number of Google searches for \u201c election fraud punishment \u201d in swing states in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nBelow we explore the details and the data of what happened across the nation on Election Day , with flagrant and often sloppy irregularities occurring from coast to coast .\nElsewhere we explore similar efforts in the key swing states of Pennsylvania , Wisconsin , Michigan , and Georgia .\nAll of the posts in this series will be updated as more credible information is uncovered .\nThe media is trying to weave a narrative with ever-shifting goalposts .\nThey began by saying that not only did voter fraud not happen , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Now , they have shifted their story to saying that there is always minor fraud , but that it never really matters much .\nThe Heritage Foundation has identified 1,200 elections where voter fraud made the difference in recent decades , long after the era of Jim Crow when election theft was de rigueur .\nOf these , fully 15 were thrown out specifically because of cheating by mail-in ballot .\nMail-in ballots are largely banned in Europe , where voter ID requirements are likewise the norm .\nFlorida has been recognized specifically @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the controlled media is that illegal aliens and other non-citizens don \u2019 t vote .\nThis is patently untrue .\nIn fact , they vote at alarmingly high rates .\nA 2019 study found that approximately 2.2 percent of respondents admitted to voting illegally , which implies a little under a million ballots cast by non-citizens every year .\nThe counterargument is that respondents are either lying or misunderstood the question , but this is simply not true \u2014 those who conducted the study verified their votes .\nSo we can see that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is common .\nIt is not negligible , it has determined elections in living memory .\nWith this as our backdrop , we will now investigate voter irregularities throughout the nation during the 2020 Presidential election .\nBefore going further , it is worth discussing what constitutes evidence for electoral fraud .\nWell , the Carter Center has a set of standards that they use to determine whether or not there has been electoral fraud somewhere .\nThese are the standards used by globalists to determine whether or not elections they disapprove @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of them are present in the contested states : \u2022 Votes should be presented for independent review .\n\u2022 Elections should be subject to recounts .\nAdditionally , the Carter Center states that it is the right of dissidents to challenge and question the results of an election that they believe to be fraudulent .\nHarassing dissidents is considered evidence of chicanery in and of itself .\n\u201c Effective redress \u201d is the term they use and it is considered by the Carter Center to be vital for establishing an election as legitimate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to recounts and audits should be a red flag in and of itself .\nThere are also mathematical anomalies that are worth looking into because , regardless of turnout and outcome , elections will follow certain patterns .\nOne of these is that , because of mail sorting , mail-in ballots will consistently show the same ratio of support for each candidate .\nWe did not see that , however \u2014 there is a significant spike in support for Biden and fall off in support for President Trump as Election Night dragged on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anomaly became massive around 4 a.m. , the same time that the massive ballot drops without supervision began .\nThe same phenomenon occurred in Pennsylvania , Michigan and Georgia , all four of these states with copious amounts of electoral chicanery and irregularity .\nVirginia was another state with similar mathematical irregularities .\nBenford \u2019 s Law is another area where we see mathematical irregularities .\nPut simply : When we have large datasets of numbers , there is a pattern we can find with regard to the final and penultimate digit of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Benford \u2019 s Law analysis is one of the first things run by forensic accountants looking for financial malfeasance or tax cheating .\nMany of the electoral tallies in disputed states violate Benford \u2019 s Law \u2014 but only for Joe Biden , whose distribution more closely resembles the curve when people type \u201c random \u201d numbers in .\nPresident Trump , Jo Jorgensen , Howie Hawkins , and Kanye West \u2019 s numbers do not violate this law , but former Vice President Biden \u2019 s do in disputed areas .\nThe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was altered and locked after several enterprising Twitter users began investigating this strand of the 2020 election theft .\nThe Glitch From Coast to Coast One recurring theme throughout the 2020 election is the glitch .\nThere have been a number of glitches , many detailed in our series on irregularities in different states .\nThis , in and of itself might not be cause for concern \u2014 however , in every case , these so-called \u201c software glitches \u201d favor former Vice President Biden at the expense of President Donald Trump .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ our state series article , but we will mention some here just to give you a general idea of what has been going on with these \u201c glitches.\n\u201d One in Michigan sent 6,000 votes to Biden that were meant for Donald Trump .\nAnother in Wisconsin , robbed Donald Trump of 19,500 votes .\nAnother similar glitch in Georgia saw an unspecified number of votes go to Biden that were , once again , meant for the President .\nThere appears to be a pattern here .\nWere these all bona fide @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that were meant to go for Joe Biden going to Donald Trump before the situation was corrected .\nBut we are unaware of any such error in favor of the President .\nThe common denominator ?\nThe voting software used to calculate the vote made by a company with deep connections to the DNC .\nThe DNC \u2019 s victory in the 2020 Presidential election relies heavily upon a massively increased turnout , again centered around a handful of large cities controlled by the Democratic Party .\nOne example of this is 90 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Wisconsin , which would not only be the highest level of turnout in American history , but also comes close to the 92 percent average in Australia where voting is mandatory .\nIn the city of Milwaukee alone , the turnout was 84 percent .\nCompare this turnout to Cleveland , a culturally comparable city not in a swing state , which had a comparatively scant 51 percent turnout .\nThis is an important city to draw a contrast with because , while it is a Democratic stronghold , as are most large @ @ @ @ @ @ @ minority population , it was not in a state that was considered in play this election .\nDemocrats attempted to steal the election by fabricating astronomical turnout in urban areas they control in swing states .\nThe turnout gambit becomes even more laughable when one considers that Biden is one of the least invigorating Democratic candidates since John Kerry or Mike Dukakis .\nYet somehow this candidate was able to increase his vote above what Barack Obama enjoyed , with some districts in Milwaukee putting up more votes than there are registered voters @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conducted by Judicial Watch found that 353 counties across 29 states had turnout exceeding 100 percent of registered voters .\nEight of these had turnout exceeding 100 percent across the entire state : Alaska , Colorado , Maine , Maryland , Michigan , New Jersey , Rhode Island , and Vermont .\nPerhaps more damning , the study was limited to 37 states publishing their voter registration data .\nThis means that , of the 37 states that Judicial Watch had access to , 78 percent of them had turnout exceeding 100 percent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ months in advance that mail-in balloting , illegal throughout most of Europe , is inherently insecure and lends itself to the kind of mass voter fraud that we are seeing in action right now .\nBut the mail-in ballots that we are seeing in this election are not just nonspecifically \u201c suspect.\n\u201d They are rife with irregularities and a lack of accountability that should cause them to be closely investigated , audited and , where appropriate , thrown out entirely .\nMail-in ballots in Pennsylvania are particularly questionable .\nThis is a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lead in mail-in voting .\nMore damning is the fact that many of these ballots seem to have arrived before they were even sent , arrived the same day or arrived within one day of being sent .\nThis is an abnormal amount of processing time , especially when we consider the surge in mail due to the election .\nJames O \u2019 Keefe found two whistleblowers at USPS , one of whom was willing to come forward , who told of backdating ballots .\nThis whistleblower was intimidated by the feds and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his report .\nVetting of mail-in ballots is particularly important because they are widely open to electoral fraud , as we have discussed above .\nSo it is troubling that we have multiple reports , including in the form of sworn affidavits presented before the court , of poll watchers being thrown out , mocked , intimidated and even physically assaulted during the course of counting mail-in ballots .\nOf special note is the strong resistance to poll workers in swing states to allow anyone to watch them .\nIn Pennsylvania , poll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ watchers despite knowledge of a court order preventing them from doing so .\nReports of expelled poll watchers were part of the lawsuit filed in Michigan and there were similar reports out of Georgia .\nThis raises the obvious question \u2014 why don \u2019 t they want anyone watching them ?\nBiden \u2019 s turnout when compared with Barack Obama is another area warranting special investigation .\nIt is worth noting that Biden was generally viewed as a less-than-ideal candidate in no small part because he generated very little enthusiasm among Democratic Party @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a rock star candidate who had just defeated the party \u2019 s presumptive nominee in a hard-fought primary .\nBiden , on the other hand , was largely foisted on the party through back room deals in an attempt to prevent Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders from obtaining the nomination for President .\nBiden also barely campaigned throughout the primary season .\nMost of the campaign was characterized by the candidate calling \u201c lids , \u201d a term meaning that he was home for the day and would be doing no more press , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did he start with an unethusiastic base who would have preferred nearly anyone else , he did little to motivate his base throughout the course of the election .\nYet somehow , he outperformed Hillary Clinton who won a hard-fought primary against Senator Sanders and kept pace with numbers from Barack Obama \u2019 s 2008 and 2012 campaigns , being able to boast that he has received more votes than any other candidate for President in American history .\nIn some cases \u2014 tellingly in areas crucial for winning the election \u2014 Biden @ @ @ @ @ @ @ For example , in Chester , Cumberland , and Montgomery Counties in Pennsylvania , he outperformed Obama by approximately 25 percent .\nIn Montgomery County , he was able to double Barack Obama \u2019 s margin of victory .\nHe increased the raw vote total there by fully 80,000 votes .\nThe population of this county only increased by 22,000 in the years between Obama \u2019 s victory and Biden \u2019 s alleged one .\nNot only should we be skeptical of the numbers , we should be skeptical of them because of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dubious numbers were not coming in from places that we could assume were Democratic Party strongholds like New York , Chicago and Miami where Biden actually saw a decrease in voters relative to Hillary Clinton .\nSo why is he putting up these high totals only in a handful of cities ( Atlanta , Detroit , Milwaukee , Philadelphia ) controlled by Democrats in swing states ?\nAnother area of suspicion are the Biden-only ballots .\nTens or hundreds of thousands of voters marked their ballots only for Joe Biden , with presumably @ @ @ @ @ @ @ While it \u2019 s not unusual for people to take an outsized interest in the Presidential election , it is unusual for 450,000 people to have no interest in down ballot races and for this to be concentrated in a handful of swing states .\nThe strange dichotomy here is that people were far more likely to do this in alleged swing states with competitive Senate races like Georgia , while deep red states like Wyoming did not see a massive number of Biden-only ballots .\nIn Georgia , there was only a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down ticket Senate races .\nBiden , on the other hand , received over 95,000 more votes than either Senate candidate on the ballot in Georgia .\nIn Wyoming there were a mere 725 more votes for Biden than the Democratic Senate candidate in the state .\nRaheem Kassam reports on five states with anomalous Biden-only voting , all of which keep coming up with various irregularities : Pennsylvania ( 98,000 ) , Georgia ( 80-90,000 ) , Arizona ( 42,000 ) , Michigan ( 69-115,000 ) and Wisconsin ( 62,836 ) .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ of 29 competitive House races as of November 8 and flipped three state legislatures , but were somehow unable to deliver the White House to the President .\nSo we are expected to believe that not only did Joe Biden receive more votes than Barack Obama and that these came largely on the back of massive inner-city turnout , but that this massive turnout for Joe Biden was unable to flip a single state legislature .\nBiden-only ballots are a recurring theme in all of the states in question .\nWhile they are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they do point toward significant irregularities that need to be investigated before Joe Biden can begin claiming victory .\nWho Counts the Votes ?\nIrregularities In Counting Systems There is a quote often attributed to Joseph Stalin , but is probably apocryphal : It doesn \u2019 t who votes , it matters who counts the votes .\nIt doesn \u2019 t really matter who , if anyone , actually said this .\nThe point is that it doesn \u2019 t matter what votes actually say if the votes are ignored or altered by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the 21st Century most of our vote counting is done by machines which use proprietary software .\nMost states used systems supplied by Dominion Voting Systems .\nWhat \u2019 s more , the irregularities in vote counting , in particular the \u201c glitches \u201d that universally favor Joe Biden , come from these voting systems .\nFirst , we should note that there were 92 donations made by Dominion employees over the last year according to the FEC .\nOf these , 80 went to Democratic super PAC ActBlue , seven went to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Trump campaign and one went to the DNC .\nWhat \u2019 s more , Dominion Voting Systems has a partnership with the Clinton Global Initiative as well as former employees of the Clinton Growth Initiative on staff , according to One America News Network .\nRudy Giuliani claims that the legal campaign to protect the election has whistleblowers from Dominion ready to go on record .\nA bit in the weeds , but worth mentioning , is the allegation that intelligence software was used to change vote counts .\nThere is a video @ @ @ @ @ @ @ say , this is a bit in the weeds , but worth mentioning for those who wish to go down that rabbit hole .\nNOQ Report has been kind enough to do a deep dive on the topic of Dominion \u2019 s role in the 2020 Presidential election .\nThey found significant vote switching in Georgia ( 17,407 , where Biden leads with 14,148 votes ) and Pennsylvania ( with over one million votes switched in favor of Joe Biden ) .\nThe article is mostly just a list of switched votes and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because it sheds light on just how massive a role vote switching played in the 2020 election , further cementing the theory that Dominion played a role in the theft .\nDon \u2019 t let any of this get you down , because the fight is far from over .\nBoth President Trump and Congressional Republicans are working hard , both in the public sphere and in the courts to make sure that the 2020 election is fair and transparent .\nSo what can you do to join in the fight ?\nFirst @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nThat means calling your state rep , your state senator , your House Rep and your U.S .\nSenator .\nYou should do this be they friend or foe \u2014 either way , they need to know that you insist on having all legal votes counted

.\nAfter Deutsche Bank flip-flopped on its view for the dollar , first closing out its long-running dollar short then reversing itself just days later and renewing its USD short , other banks have joined the bandwagon expecting a major drop in the world \u2019 s reserve currency in the coming year .\nIn a Friday note from Goldman \u2019 s chief FX strategist Zach Pandal , he predicts that \u201c depreciation in the broad Dollar can continue in 2021 \u201d and writes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a 6 % decline in the broad trade-weighted Dollar index over the next 12 months , and a \u201c sustained but orderly \u201d 15 % real depreciation from its 2020 peak to the end of 2024 .\nIn fact , Goldman \u2019 s 12-month outlook on the dollar means that the bank sees the US currency being the worst performer in the coming year , while the Russian Ruble is expected to be the best currency in 2021 , rising nearly 18 % .\nSome more from Goldman \u2019 s short dollar thesis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ US economic and asset market outperformance , the Dollar appears meaningfully overvalued\u2014about 10 % on standard metrics \u2014 and many investors are overweight US assets .\n\u2022 The Fed has also cut rates

.\nRepresentatives from one party were systematically barred from observing the ballot counts .\nThe dead were resurrected for a day to vote for a particular party .\nThe seemingly unbridgeable chasm between the Trump and Biden rallies did not translate into proportionate votes .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ Benford \u2019 s Law , were mangled in this farce .\nJust how could the incumbent lose Arizona when one juxtaposes the staggering 96 mile-long Trump train rally in the state with the minuscule crowds drawn by his opponent ?\nEven online , Trump supporters easily outnumbered their counterparts by several magnitudes .\nThe illusion of Biden \u2019 s popularity had to be propped by paid trolls from India !\nThe US electoral imbroglio is indeed the result of the \u201c most extensive and inclusive voter fraud organization in the history of American @ @ @ @ @ @ @ verbatim from none other than Joe Biden himself .\nThe most puzzling aspect of this travesty was the nomination of Biden as the Democrat Presidential nominee in August this year .\nInsiders would have been aware of his son \u2019 s incriminating laptops , including alleged evidences of child pornography and dubious dealings with Ukraine and China which stretch back to Biden \u2019 s stint as Vice President .\nThe FBI was reportedly in possession of such material since December 2019 but predictably did nothing .\nSo why nominate a highly-compromised and senescent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when any other cardboard cut-out would do ?\nPerhaps , House Speaker Nancy Pelosi \u2019 s recent invocation of the 25th Amendment offers the best clue : A full month before the elections , the Speaker called for the establishment of a ( presumably permanent ) commission to determine a president \u2019 s fitness for office .\nPelosi

allegations of \u201c rigged elections \u201d in nations not aligned to US foreign policy .\nThe promise of a comeback by Trump in 2024 would be an ideal psychological sop to avert civil war for as

absolutely rigged , we are soaking in information through fire hoses of complicated mathematical alterations to the votes , \u201d stated Powell .\n\u201c It would be beneficial for Joe Biden to

track and organize anomalies and legal issues of this \u2018 intentional blindness \u2019 toward alleged corruption , someone even created a crowdsourcing tool .\nAnd yet the mainstream media continues to repeatedly state that \u201c Trump has put forward a flurry of charges of election fraud without providing evidence.\n\u201d Like Amazing Polly says , no matter what Trump does , \u201c he \u2019 s seemingly trapped in the script.\n\u201d The Daily Mail , for instance , says The New York Times did not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ top election officials in every state , and Twitter called Trump \u2019 s claim about election fraud \u201c disputed.\n\u201d ( In the course of two weeks Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey \u2019 s platform slapped warning labels on 300,000 election-related tweets , including over 50 from US President Donald Trump . )\nBut who gives license to social media platforms and publications to serve as the arbiters of truth ?\nThey \u2019 ve been caught repeatedly lying to the people , making them arguably co-conspirators in an attempt to hijack a democratic election @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as Nancy Pelosi and Senate Minority Leader Charles Schumer of New York are also toting the narrative that President Trump and his legal team are all delusional and that lawsuits are \u201c frivolous.\n\u201d \u201c Instead of working to pull the country back together , Republicans in Congress are spreading conspiracy theories , denying reality , and poisoning the well of our democracy , \u201d Schumer said at a press conference .\nEven the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency ( CISA ) has issued a press release with Dominion Voting Systems , stating @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any voting system deleted or lost votes , changed votes , or was in any way compromised.\n\u201d They added that \u201c the November 3rd election was the most secure in American history.\n\u201d Note that both Dominion and Smartmatic are listed as members of CISA \u2019 s Sector Coordinating Council and appear to be actively involved , as they are named \u201c Organizing Members \u201d of the SCC .\nIsn \u2019 t this a conflict of interest ?\nOn November 17th , Trump fired Christopher Krebs , the director of CISA , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ s election cybersecurity efforts .\nRegardless of the mainstream narrative , the vote is not official until it is \u2018 certified \u2019 \u2013 that is officially declared valid \u2013 which happens later in November .\nGeorgia certifies on November 20 , and Nevada and Wisconsin are last on December 1 .\n\u201c We do not have a president-elect at this time , \u201d said Dr. Kelli Ward , chairwoman of the Republican Party of Arizona.\n\u201c States have not certified elections , and that \u2019 s what makes a president-elect \u2014 not the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the talking heads , not the fake news.\n\u201d Votes by mail have been questioned in the past by both sides of the aisle .\nBack in 2005 , a bipartisan report of The Commission on Federal Election Reform , chaired by former President Jimmy Carter and former Secretary of State , James Baker III , concluded that \u201c absentee ballots remain the largest source of potential voter fraud.\n\u201d Many instances of fraud historically exist .\nIn December 2019 , Democratic Sens .\nElizabeth Warren , Ron Wyden , and Amy Klobuchar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Dominion Voting Systems .\nThey warned about reports of machines \u201c switching votes , \u201d \u201c undisclosed vulnerabilities , \u201d and \u201c improbable \u201d results that \u201c threaten the integrity of our elections.\n\u201d \u201c Election security experts have noted for years that the nation \u2019 s election systems and infrastructure are under serious threat.\n\u201d President Trump , along with many critics , anticipated as early as April that mail-in voting was rife with issues .\nFor instance , on November 5th , President Trump told Americans that the election was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ massive vote-by-mail was \u201c destroying the integrity of America \u2019 s future elections.\n\u201d Attorney General William Barr has also repeatedly stated that mail-in voting \u201c opens the floodgates to fraud.\n\u201d Was COVID-19 a Trojan horse to flood elections with mail-in voting ballots ?\nConsidering that many have known as early as February that this coronavirus is less fatal than the flu , could it be that the coronavirus was used as a cover to justify mail-in voting ?\nDemocratic counties , like Hennepin County , asked for millions of dollars as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ June for an election five months away .\nIf it was safe to take to the streets for a projected Biden win during a supposed pandemic , why didn \u2019 t people cast a vote in person just three days prior ?\nRona seems to be able to defeat all matters of logic .\nIt \u2019 s an extremely intelligent virus that makes up its own working hours and knows how to go into suspended animation whenever people eat .\nWhy are churches and Trump rallies super-spreaders when riots and premature celebrations are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dangerous , or the media are damned liars , \u201d the Ben Shapiro Show host told podcast listeners .\n\u201c You couldn \u2019 t visit grandma in the hospital while she was dying because COVID is \u2018 super dangerous , \u2019 but you can be out there not wearing a mask\u2026celebrating Trump not being in office.\n\u201d According to attorney Lin Wood , rules regarding elections were changed because of COVID-19 to the ability of people to vote by mail .\nAs a result of the coronavirus ( COVID-19 ) pandemic , hundreds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ involving election administration issues .\nThe lawsuits highlight anomalies , statistical impossibilities , and other perceived problems that could affect vote counts .\nMany websites reported that by 10 pm , President Trump had a 70 % chance of winning the election , according to the initial statistical calculations .\nAround midnight on November 3rd , as The Gateway Pundit ( TGP ) reported : But upon waking , the mainstream and social media painted an entirely different picture .\nTo be clear , the press doesn \u2019 t get to call an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the dead of night at \u201c Around 3:30 am , \u2018 magically \u2019 out of nowhere , Joe Biden \u2019 s Wisconsin tally jumped up almost 200,000 votes without a single vote for President Donald Trump .\nIn Michigan , the vote \u2018 inexplicably \u2019 jumped up over 130,000 votes for Biden , without a single new vote for Trump , \u201d reported the website Stop The World .\nIf I were to flip a coin , what are the chances that absolutely none land tails ?\nAre we to believe that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ millions more votes than Obama \u2019 s historic 2008 election where he ended up with 365 electoral votes , winning Florida , North Carolina , and even Indiana ?\nWere ballots manufactured ?\nWas there a glitch in the software ?\nDo the digital ballots cast match up with any paper trail ?\nIs there a paper trail if the ballots use a barcode ?\nRegardless of whatever side of the aisle you sit on , voter integrity should matter .\nThe Hammer And The Scorecard State officials reject the existence of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a hoax .\nYet evidence exists that Dennis Montgomery , CIA contractor turned whistleblower , designed and built a powerful supercomputer system known as THE HAMMER .\nThis system includes an application known as SCORECARD that is capable of hacking into elections and stealing the vote , claim critics .\nDuring a recent interview with Two Mikes , Lt. Gen. Thomas McInerney described \u201c Hammer \u201d and \u201c Scorecard , \u201d a pair of programs initially designed for the CIA before being privatized by Deep State players from the Obama administration .\nThis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on activities in protected networks ( like voting machines ) without detection .\n\u201c Scorecard \u201d is a vote-manipulation application that changes votes during transfer .\nIt \u2019 s the least detectable form of election manipulation , because it works during data transfer between voting stations and data storage hubs .\nUnless both sides are looking for irregularities , it \u2019 s impossible to catch .\nIf nefarious forces had people on one side or the other ( or both ) during data transfer , it can not be exposed .\nThe allegation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was used to reportedly steal votes in Florida , Georgia , Texas , Pennsylvania , Wisconsin , Nevada , and Arizona , says Montgomery .\nFox Business recently discussed election fraud with Powell .\nShe confirmed the likelihood that 3 % of the election results were changed using the Scorecard software .\nDominion machines were involved in 30 states in America , and are used in every state where Trump is launching legal fights .\nYet several experts and officials have stated that there is no reason to believe those machines altered the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ employees of the voting machine/software company \u201c Dominion , \u201d whose products were used in multiple U.S. States for the recent election , have come forward and are blowing the whistle about election theft perpetrated through their company \u2019 s voting software , whereupon massive amounts of votes were changed from President Trump to Biden .\nThe accusation is that millions of votes were switched or simply removed altogether .\nPowell said the software , dubbed Smartmatic , was designed for the sole purpose of shifting voting results .\n\u201c It \u2019 s @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I can \u2019 t tell you how livid I am at our government for not paying attention to complaints , even brought by Democrats\u2026 No one in our government has paid any attention to it which makes me wonder if the CIA has used it for its own benefit in different places , \u201d said Powell .\n\u201c It was a feature of the system that was designed with a back door so that people could watch in real-time and calculate with an algorithm how many votes they needed to change to make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Over the weekend , the President \u2019 s personal attorney , Rudy Giuliani , brought attention to the company \u2019 s alleged involvement .\nHe noted the evidence \u201c will all come out.\n\u201d Powell also specifically pointed out that a member of Joe Biden \u2019 s team is also on the board of directors for a software company behind the flawed Dominion voting systems .\nDominion Voting System says these assertions are completely false .\nPowell hopes to reveal all pertaining affidavits and evidence of fraud before the election

the lower house of Argentina \u2019 s Congress approved a bill seeking to raise 300 billion pesos ( $ 3.75 billion ) through a tax on the ultra rich to finance programs aimed at helping families hit by the COVID-19 pandemic .\nIn a vote that passed 133 to 115 with two abstentions , people with more than $ 2.5 million in net worth \u2013 over 10,000 individuals \u2013 will make an \u201c Extraordinary Solidarity Payment , \u201d paying a one-off @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would increase progressively as equity increases , under the proposal .\n\u201c The level of concentration of wealth , in a few hands , is so strong that this contribution falls on less than 0.02 percent of the population , \u201d said government deputy Fernanda Vallejos during debate .\n\u201c About half of what is collected will be contributed by only 252 people , those who are at the top of the pyramid.\n\u201d Government supporters took to the streets on Tuesday to show their support for the bill , with militant

\u2013 may face a tougher time in the Senate , which will likely consider it before the end of the month , with the Frente de Todos coalition needing allies to support it .\nThe one-time ( for now ) tax will apply to individuals whose declared assets exceed 200 million pesos ( US $ 2.35 million ) , with a progressive rate of up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and up to 5.25 % on goods outside the country .\nAccording to AFP , between 9,000 and 12,000 people fall into that bracket in Argentina , a country with 40.9 % of its 44 million inhabitants currently living in poverty .\nUnemployment stands at just over 10 % , with the economy still yet to overcome a recession that began in 2018 .\nThings have only worsened after the coronavirus pandemic , and the IMF estimates GDP will contract by 11 % this year .\nThe bill lays out that the \u201c @ @ @ @ @ @ @ measure and it indicates where the funds will be sent and what they will be used for .\nFor example , it names development and production programmes for small- and medium-sized businesses ( SMEs ) , education projects and student scholarships , as well as the purchase of medical equipment .\nIt establishes that 20 percent of what is raised from the levy will be used for medical supplies to attend the Covid-19 health emergency , with another 20 percent designated for SMEs , 15 percent for social development programmes , 20 percent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ development programmes related to natural gas .\nPresident Alberto Fern\u00e1ndez , who took office in December amid a recession that has been exacerbated by the pandemic , has sharply increased public spending to protect hard-hit families over recent months .\nMore than 36,106 Argentines have died of COVID-19 so far , according to official data .\nThe government hopes that the levy on large fortunes will help strengthen its fiscal outlook .\nOver the past eight months , the Fern\u00e1ndez administration has allocated millions of dollars in aid to the private sector to @ @ @ @ @

the efficient collection for those that exist , \u201d said opposition lawmaker \u00c1lvaro Gonz\u00e1lez .\n\u201c The opposition is looking for arguments @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bill , \u201d countered

, as they strip even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nPensioners kept under house arrest , in understaffed and underfunded nursing homes , prohibited from seeing their loved ones for 12-months , and as you would expect , many have lost the will to live .\nWhere is the public outrage ?\nRemember \u2013 we put up the collateral of our freedom to protect our vulnerable ranks .\nWe carried the yoke of

overwhelmed \u2019 trending in government , are we seeing an increase in hospital admissions ?\nNot in the slightest .\nIn week 45 A & E attendances for acute respiratory infection was running at less than 70 % capacity , compared to the baseline , and there were significantly more respiratory-related hospital admissions in Dec 2019 , pre-COVID .\nThis fact alone would suggest the government is a

on 31st October .\nAnd according to ONS data , in week 42 \u2018 With COVID deaths \u2019 accounted for only 4.4 % of all deaths versus influenza and pneumonia at 16.3 % .\nThen in week 43 , \u2018

decreased to 15 % of all deaths .\nDo you see what they have done there ?\nWhats more , in week 44 there was no significant excess all-cause mortality observed in the UK through the EuroMOMO algorithm .\nAlthough in week 45 this increased slightly above the baseline .\nThis paper from the Oxford University Centre for Evidence-Based Medicine ( CEBM ) , reveals COVID-19 was not the underlying cause of death for 30 % of all recent deaths attributed to the disease .\nUntil recently this discrepancy had been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deaths at the height of the pandemic , there are discrepancies , when according to ONS , \u201c of all deaths between January and August 2020 , there were 48,168 deaths due to COVID-19 compared with 13,619 deaths due to pneumonia and 394 deaths due to influenza.\n\u201d Whereas , \u2018 Influenza and pneumonia was mentioned on more death certificates than COVID-19.\n\u201d Let that sink in .\nNevertheless , Johnson has pandered to the opposition ( for want of a better word ) and delivered another lockdown .\nDespite over forty thousand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to this institutional madness .\nYet , deaf to common reason and without compunction , our political leaders continue to ride roughshod over the democratic principle when there has always been another way .\nLook at Sweden : What \u2019 s more , when we overlay deaths per million in Sweden with the UK , it is clear the virus follows its own trajectory , regardless of ineffective lockdowns : When we examine hospital admissions , COVID deaths , and excess deaths for this time of year , there is nothing exceptional in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a moderately bad flu season ?\nWell , according to ONS , up to 23rd October 2020 , there were 56,073 excess deaths over 9 months in England and Wales ( although only 45,224 of those were recorded as \u2018 with Covid deaths \u2019 ) .\nWhereas in the winter of 2017/2018 \u2013 over a shorter period of 3 months \u2013 there were 50,100 excess deaths .\nAnd 2017-2018 saw the highest excess deaths since winter 1975/1976 : Finally , Rick Hayward , writing for Hector Drummond has extrapolated all-cause winter-spring mortality going @ @ @ @ @ @ @ population growth , 2019-20 is in fact the eighth worst season of the last twenty-six : The rules for clinicians on defining COVD cases clearly states the \u2018 presence of symptoms.\n\u2019 But contrary to these rules , more than 80 % of those tested on the day had no symptoms .\nSo why then is this government counting non-symptomatic cases as cases ?\nWhy do they refuse to publish or even acknowledge the impact of false positives ?\nAnd importantly , why is COVID is the most politicised cause of death in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is important to understand that those driving this controlled demolition forward have skin in the game .\nEspecially Her Majesty \u2019 s Government .\nThe UK is the number one investor in immunology amongst all G7 countries .\nThe British Society for Immunology is the largest in Europe .\nThe life sciences industry , of which immunology is an important part was worth \u00a370 billion to the UK economy in 2019 .\nThe UK is the biggest country donor to the World Health Organisation .\nAnd the UK is the number one funder @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It is well understood that a global mandatory vaccination program would be one of the world \u2019 s most lucrative commodities .\nDo the math : the average cost of a vaccine x 7.8 billion people x every year of their lives .\nImmunisation , therefore , presents a golden opportunity for Britain to restore its legacy of empire , through the quasi-imperialistic meddling in the affairs of developing nations , with a global mandatory vaccination program that would give the old empire significant influence over global health and education policy .\nDespite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the UK \u2019 s influenza vaccine was just 15 % effective for 2017-18 .\nWould you pay the full price for a car that was 15 % operational ?\nOr a lunch that was 15 % food ?\nNo .\nBut if those products were mandatory you would have no choice .\nIn light of the British government \u2019 s commitment to vaccinations , it should be a cause for great alarm that the verdict of Simon Dolan \u2019 s court case against the Secretary of State has set a dangerous legal precedent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be using to pronounce mandatory vaccinations lawful .\nNo indictment of the pandemic response would be complete without a mention of the technocratic takeover of our cultural commons , orchestrated by unelected decision-makers , like the WEF , through programs like The Great Reset , which the UK has been onboard with since at least 2017 , when Matt Hancock was Minister for Digital .\nIn 2019 , the British government laid out its roadmap towards the Fourth Industrial Revolution in this white paper .\nNotice this statement : With a background in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coincidence that our masquerading Minister of Health , Matt Hancock , is at the helm of the greatest public health response in history .\nA role that reprises many of the technologies Hancock was bringing to market during his tenure as Minister for Digital , which COVID provides the necessary bluster to implement , including contact tracing , immunity passports , and other apparatus of digital control and surveillance being rolled out under the Joint Biosecurity Centre , and foreshadowing the merger of human , digital and smart grid .\nAnother stooge doing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ towards a Great Reset is our own affable dictator , Johnson \u2013 a disciple of the cult of technocracy since his address to the UN in 2019 .\nSo committed in fact , he has ruled out , under any circumstances , a return to normal , ever , regardless of how the pandemic pans out , beyond the vicissitudes of his crystal ball .\nAccording to the vision of the Great Reset , by 2030 \u2018 we will own nothing ; all products will become services.\n\u2019 By which time we will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ workers worldwide , with the overhaul of cheaper artificial intelligence to replace arbitrary and costly human labour .\nPeople and communities will be sacrificed at the corporate altar as a corporation \u2019 s right to higher margins takes precedence over a person \u2019 s right to work and maintain financial independence .\nHumanity will become auxiliary to the rights of nature , with the alignment of the Fourth Industrial Revolution , Climate Change and the SDGs of the UN \u2019 s Agenda 2030 .\nA kind of world communism will pervade the social @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kind of one size fits all , while those at the top of the pyramid will benefit exclusively from a capitalist system gone rogue .\nThe social credit system that scores citizens on their \u2018 behaviour \u2019 is already a dystopian nightmare for millions of Chinese citizens \u2013 prohibited from travelling on trains and aeroplanes .\nThis apparatus of social control is already being trumpeted in Australia \u2019 s political pulpits as the exit plan for COVID , should Australian citizens wish to re-enter the economy themselves in 2021 .\nRipples of this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shores of mainland Britain , with the Universal Living Wage system under trial runs in British Cities .\nIt is , therefore , no surprise that the Coronavirus Act was renewed on 30th September by the shills at Westminster .\nDespite the drum-beating of apparently dissenting MPs , in the end all these mutineers ( in name only ) could muster was a kind of vague gentlemen \u2019 s agreement on votes \u2018 where possible \u2019 on \u2018 significant measures.\n\u2019 Whatever that means .\nEven more disturbing was the idle voter turnout @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 54 % of MPs could be bothered to raise their hand to vote \u2013 including a flimsy 3 % of all Labour MPs \u2013 on what is perhaps the most important piece of legislation in history .\nAs a result we now stand at a crossroads , in what is destined to become the most important moment in history .\nLooking out onto a bleak horizon , where human freedom will become a thing of the past , with two possible scenarios to consider going forward .\nBecause we all know what \u2019 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ each dissenter carefully deciding where they want to get trapped .\nBecause in a few months once \u2018 vaccine-apartheid \u2019 is implemented , those who refuse the jab will have very limited access to the economy and escape through international travel will be impossible .\nThe second scenario involves humanity resurfacing from behind the sofa .\nOrganizing into a powerful coalition of stakeholders , towards a national opposition movement , with a clear and focussed mandate : to reclaim our citizenry , implement an independent publicly led inquiry to examine the science vs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ account for their malfeasance , and change the course of history .\nBecause with the vast majority of career MPss complicit in this agenda or lacking the vertebrae to oppose it , the burden of responsibility now rests squarely on the shoulders of the people .\nAt this critical juncture , it is our civic duty to push back , resist , dissent , disobey .\nLet civil disobedience rip

problem : By injecting trillions of bailout dollars into the system , the Federal Reserve prevented the economy from going through its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have been painful for many , but survivable , and it would have removed large amounts of excess debt , parasitic corporations that produce little or nothing of use , as well as numerous toxic assets with no legitimate value .\nFor a real free market to function , weak or corrupt elements must be allowed to fail and die .\nInstead , central banks around the world and most prominently the Fed kept all of those destructive elements on life support .\nThis has created what amounts to a \u201c zombie economy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ outside support ( stimulus ) in order to continue moving forward .\nIn the process of keeping zombie corporations and other parts of the body alive , healthy parts of the economy , like the small business sector , get devoured .\nThe zombie economy is , however , highly fragile .\nAll it takes is one or two major shocks to bring it down , and the moment this happens the whole facade will disintegrate , leaving the public in panic and disarray .\nThis is what is happening right now in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ worse in 2021 .\nBailouts encourage and reward unhealthy financial behavior , and this is why national debt , corporate debt and consumer debt have recently hit historic highs .\nWhen every pillar of the economy is encumbered with the weight of debt , any instability has the possibility of bringing all those pillars down at once .\nThe Federal Reserve turned the U.S. into an economic time bomb , and the Fed is itself more like a suicide bomber than some kind of fiscal savior .\nI first heard the term \u201c @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u201d back in 2014/2015 .\nI wrote an article about how the reset was actually a long term process in my article The Global Economic Reset Has Begun .\nChristine Lagarde was the head of the IMF back then , and she mentioned it briefly in multiple interviews .\nI made a mental note of it because it seemed planted into the discussion very awkwardly , as if it was scripted .\nI rarely heard it mentioned for years after that .\nIn 2020 , as we descend into social and economic chaos @ @ @ @ @ @ @ used everywhere in the media and by globalists .\nOver the past decade , globalist institutions have come up with numerous phrases that seem to refer to a worldwide planned and dramatic shift in human society sometime in the near future .\nThe \u201c great reset \u201d is just another phrase for \u201c the new world order.\n\u201d It is important to understand that the reset these people are talking about has actually been engineered and staged for many years .\nThis is not something that just popped up in 2020 \u2014 they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ least 2014 .\nAnd before that , they talked about the new world order , and \u201c multilateralism , \u201d and the \u201c multi-polar world order , \u201d and Agenda 2030 , etc .\nThe reset is the catalyst phase of an agenda that has been in the works for a long time now .\nThe goal , as they have openly admitted many times , is to centralize the entire globe into one monetary structure , one highly interdependent and socialized economy , and eventually one faceless and unaccountable governing body .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ finalization of the reset and the formation of the new world order has been liberty-minded populations across the planet \u2014 most of all , the liberty-minded people within America .\nThe U.S. has to be destabilized or eliminated ; the old world order has to be brought down before the new world order can be introduced .\nThe people have to be beaten down and desperate , so that when the globalists offer their \u201c reset \u201d as the solution , the people will gladly accept it without question \u2014 simply because they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stop .\nA common statement made by globalists from Klaus Schwab at the World Economic Forum to the current Prime Minister of Canada , Justin Trudeau , is that the coronavirus pandemic is the \u201c perfect opportunity \u201d to trigger the \u201c great reset.\n\u201d As globalist Rahm Emanuel is famous for admitting , in crisis there is opportunity to do things you were not able to do before .\nIn other words , when people panic in the face of crisis , they become easy to manipulate .\nAnd , if a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then why not create a crisis from thin air and use that to cause panic ?\nThe lockdowns have not only been proven to do nothing to stop the spread of the coronavirus , but they are also a clear attack on what \u2019 s left of our economic system .\nThe small business sector in particular is being gutted as more than 60 % of those that shut down during the first lockdown were unable to reopen .\nSmall businesses provide more than half of all employment in the U.S..\nWhen they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nothing left except the big-box corporations that the Fed put on life support over a decade ago .\nReal unemployment , which is already at 26 % , will skyrocket even further if a second national lockdown is initiated .\nThe speedy collapse of the U.S. economy will be assured , and the \u201c great reset \u201d can commence .\nAt least , that is what the globalists want to happen\u2026 With the U.S. presidential election currently being contested , it is hard to say how the next few months will play out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pointing out since July , a contested election is the best possible scenario for the globalists because it creates a Catch-22 situation : \u2022 If Trump stays in office , the political left will accuse him of usurping the presidency and there will be mass riots in the streets .\nConservatives will be tempted with the idea of bringing in martial law to suppress rioters , and such measures will undermine the flow of the U.S. economy , causing its fragile structure to implode .\n\u2022 If Biden enters the White House , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lockdown similar to the lockdowns we have seen in Australia , France , Germany and the UK ; perhaps even worse .\nOur economy will crumble , conservatives will revolt , and Biden will attempt martial law measures .\nEither way , the globalists get their crisis , and therein their opportunity .\nSurviving the lockdowns and deterring the globalists But here is where things get less certain for the elites .\nIf liberty-minded Americans organize immediately for security and mutual aid , we can defuse the Catch-22 .\nIf we provide for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , there will be no rationale for Trump to institute martial law .\nCommunity security is an awesome deterrent against leftist rioting and looting , and basic economic trade can continue .\nBy extension , if we organize our own community security as well as localize our economies with barter and trade , we also act as a deterrent to Biden and any ideas he might have of enforcing national lockdowns .\nThe point is , we can \u2019 t allow the globalists to dictate the terms of the crisis .\nWe must @ @ @ @ @ @ @ game .\nThe reset is not a natural inevitability , it is a con , a trap .\nNo matter how bad the crisis in our nation becomes , it is the people \u2014 namely the liberty-minded people \u2014 who will determine the future , not the globalists .\nTheir plan relies on our panic .\nInstead of panic , let \u2019 s show them a unified front and a plan of our own .\nAfter 8 long years of ultra-loose monetary policy from the Federal Reserve , it \u2019 s no secret @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If your IRA or 401 ( k ) is exposed to this threat , it \u2019 s critical to act now !\nThat \u2019 s why thousands of

implants , Americans being forced to show travel papers , and re-education camps was thought to be a crazy conspiracy theorist ?\nAnd then 2020 rolled around and voila !\nIt turns out those conspiracy theories weren \u2019 t so \u201c crazy \u201d after all .\nAnd I \u2019 m not just talking about the government releasing info about UFOs .\nWe \u2019 re living in a time when someone will attempt to beat the crap out of you , burn your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if you voted for the \u201c wrong \u201d presidential candidate .\nWe \u2019 re being subjected to curfews , our movement is restricted , and our businesses have been forcibly shut down .\nOne day , people will look back on this as the year that everything changed \u2013 or depending on how Americans respond to the mandates \u2013 the year we finally said enough .\nHere are seven things that were considered crazy conspiracy theories\u2026until now , when they \u2019 re becoming far too real .\nDid you ever really think we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the government would tell private business owners when and how they could operate ?\nWhere workers would be told , \u201c You can no longer go to work for your own good ?\n\u201d Well , welcome to 2020 .\n22 million jobs were lost and only 42 % of those were recovered by last August , when the country began to reopen .\nMillions of the lost jobs were permanent losses , as businesses across the country fold under the weight of the restrictions that either don \u2019 t allow them to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ former customers .\nBecome an Activist Post Patron for $ 1 per month at Patreon .\nOf the businesses that have closed , many will never reopen .\nMost harshly affected were small businesses .\nSo we have not only people who became unemployed , but we also have business owners who \u2019 ve lost everything .\nAs we go into the second round of lockdowns across the United States , it \u2019 s not a stretch of the imagination to think that some of the small businesses that have thus far managed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ economic effects of these mandates\u2026taking with them even more jobs and plunging even more people into poverty .\nPoverty is a vicious cycle and one seemingly small thing can suck those who are struggling into a vortex of fees and penalties from which emerging seems impossible .\nI \u2019 ve written about my own experiences with poverty here .\nThe concern is that even fewer people will recover financially after this round of government mandates , leaving even more Americans broke , hungry , and homeless .\nBut don \u2019 t worry \u2013 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I mean that in the President Reagan threatening kind of way .\nThey provided a \u201c stimulus \u201d check to everyone in America , gave such huge unemployment money to people that they made more staying home than they did going to work , and went so much deeper into debt that the number is simply unfathomable .\nIn effect , they paid people not to work .\nAnd it isn \u2019 t the fault of those people in most cases \u2013 the government forced their places of employment to close unless it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sounds a whole lot like Universal Basic Income .\nOr as I like to call it , modern feudalism .\nQuite a few people are ready to give up their freedom so that someone else can take care of them .\nThey don \u2019 t think they \u2019 re giving up freedom .\nThey \u2019 re convinced that they are embracing a smart , fair system that eliminates poverty .\nThe greed , entitlement , and lack of ambition that seems inherent in many people today will have them slipping on the yoke @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they deserve a living just for drawing breath .\nAs Gawker \u2019 s headline reads , \u201c A Universal Basic Income Is the Utopia We Deserve.\n\u201d The idea of a universal basic income for all citizens has been catching on all over the world .\nIs it too crazy to believe in ?\nWe spoke to the author of a new book on the ins , outs , and utopian dreams of making basic income a reality .\nThe basic income movement got a significant boost this week when the charity GiveDirectly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ten-year , $ 30 million pilot project giving a select group of Kenyan villagers a basic income and studying its effects .\nAs an anti-poverty solution , universal basic income appeals to impoverished people in Africa , relatively well-off Scandinavians , and Americans automated out of their jobs alike .\n( source ) Sure , money for nothing sounds great on the surface .\nBut what would the real result of a Universal Basic Income be ?\nUBI would fast-track us back to the feudalism of the Middle Ages .\nSure , we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ modern micro-efficiencies instead of shacks .\nWe \u2019 d have some kind of modern job instead of raising sheep for the lord of the manor .\nBut , in the end , we wouldn \u2019 t actually own anything because private property would be abolished for all but the ruling class .\nWe \u2019 d no longer have the ability to get ahead in life .\nOur courses would be set for us and veering off of those courses would be harshly discouraged .\nPeople will be completely dependent on the government and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , shelter , water , clothing .\nWhat better way to assert control than to make compliance necessary for survival ?\n( source ) With this second round of lockdowns how many more jobs will go permanently down the tubes ?\nWhat are all those people going to do for food ?\nFor rent ?\nThe government is going to give them money .\nAnd we can \u2019 t even argue , really , because everyone knows someone who has lost a job they had for decades and who can \u2019 t find @ @ @ @ @ @ @ something else , but Universal Basic Income is coming .\nAnd it \u2019 s coming soon .\nDon \u2019 t be ridiculous .\nWe \u2019 ll never have to show our \u201c papers \u201d to travel freely in the United States .\nNot until a COVID pandemic with all its subsidiary restrictions occurred .\nBack in March , days after I warned about the first lockdown , I wrote : For everyone who thought the article about the Lockdown of America was a \u201c hysterical overstatement \u201d and that they could still do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ t really being enforced , what are you thinking now that \u201c travel papers \u201d are being handed out ?\nTo me , this sounds like the lockdowns I wrote of yesterday were just the first incremental step toward a society that nobody hopes to see .\nYesterday , readers sent me photos of \u201c travel papers \u201d provided to them by employers so they could get to and from work .\nThese are employees who work in industries like healthcare , pharmacies , and foodservice , as well as those who work @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sales of essential supplies .\nOne reader wrote , \u201c We were told to show these if we got stopped on the way to or from work and that if the authorities gave us any trouble , to not argue and just go back home.\n\u201d Papers that people sent were from Pennsylvania , New York , Arizona , Michigan , North Carolina , Kansas , New Jersey , West Virginia , Virginia , Oregon , Florida , Louisiana , and Ohio .\nIndustries mentioned in the papers were trucking , grocery stores @ @ @ @ @ @ @ homes , city transit workers , railroads , food production plants , pharmacies , gas stations , stores like Target and Walmart , and automotive repair facilities .\nMost people were given their papers on Friday or Saturday and told they \u2019 d need them to get to and from work starting the week ahead .\n( source ) You can see some of the papers that people sent me here .\n\u201c Don \u2019 t be silly .\nNobody is actually tracking you with your phone .\nYou \u2019 re not Jason @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was a lie when they rolled out contact tracing apps to make sure you didn \u2019 t breathe the same air as somebody who got a positive COVID test .\nSo\u2026if you have a smartphone , rest assured , at some point you \u2019 re probably going to have an app like this forcibly installed during one of those relentless updates .\nOf course , they \u2019 ll say that the app is just the framework and you have to enable it for it to work .\nOh , wait , they already @ @ @ @ @ @ @ framework.\n\u201d Somehow , the United States ran out of change .\nThere were no coins to be had\u2026anywhere\u2026for a while .\nBloomberg reported in August : This had a lot of people concerned , especially since Venezuela used COVID to push citizens toward a cashless society .\nHere in the United States , the \u201c change shortage \u201d was so extensive is caused many stores to give you your change on a store loyalty card or invite you to donate that change to some cause .\nA true cashless society would allow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lives .\nSee this article for some of the totalitarian ways it would affect us .\nDarpa got involved early on , touting it as a way to \u201c save \u201d us all from COVID .\nRobert Wheeler wrote : But governments aren \u2019 t having to market the chip as a method to track , trace , and control their populations .\nInstead , they are marketing the chip as a way to track and detect COVID and other coronaviruses .\nClearly , this is a much easier sell to a public @ @ @ @ @ @ @ media outlets for the last six months .\nRaul Diego details the creation and coming rollout of the new biochip in his article , \u201c A DARPA-Funded Implantable Microchip to Detect COVID-19 Could Hit Markets By 2021 , \u201d where he writes , The most significant scientific discovery since gravity has been hiding in plain sight for nearly a decade and its destructive potential to humanity is so enormous that the biggest war machine on the planet immediately deployed its vast resources to possess and control it , financing its research and development @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Health ( NIH ) , the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency ( DARPA ) and HHS \u2019 BARDA .\nThe revolutionary breakthrough came to a Canadian scientist named Derek Rossi in 2010 purely by accident .\nThe now-retired Harvard professor claimed in an interview with the National Post that he found a way to \u201c reprogram \u201d the molecules that carry the genetic instructions for cell development in the human body , not to mention all biological lifeforms .\nThese molecules are called \u2018 messenger ribonucleic acid \u2019 or mRNA and the newfound @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any kind of cell within a biological organism has radically changed the course of Western medicine and science , even if no one has really noticed yet .\nAs Rossi , himself , puts it : \u201c The real important discovery here was you could now use mRNA , and if you got it into the cells , then you could get the mRNA to express any protein in the cells , and this was the big thing.\n\u201d ( Source ) The microchip talk died down but the fact it as even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should be troubling .\nAnyway , after the initial microchip hubbub , the push got redirected toward our next conspiracy theory .\nRemember back when nobody thought that adults would ever be forced to take vaccines except for \u201c crazy conspiracy theorists ?\n\u201d Well , that day is coming sooner than many people expect .\nA much-heralded COVID vaccine could be rolled out in a matter of days .\nPfizer and BioNTech have both concluded Phase 3 of rushing their jabs to market .\nThere are still many , many questions .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ familiar ways will take time , and how much time remains unclear .\nThe answers await more research into the vaccines , how they can be distributed and how many people are willing to get them .\n\u201c A vaccine won \u2019 t be available immediately for everybody , \u201d says Arthur Reingold , a professor of epidemiology at the School of Public Health at the University of California , Berkeley\u2026 \u2026 \u201c It probably will take four to six months , \u201d he says .\n\u201c What that says to me is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ masks at least until spring .\nWe won \u2019 t be in a magically different situation by February or March .\nI don \u2019 t see how that can possibly happen.\n\u201d Equally important are the unknowns about the vaccines themselves .\nScientists still don \u2019 t know how long vaccine-induced protection will last , for example , or whether inoculations can block actual infection , or only prevent the onset of disease .\nIf the latter turns out to be the case , meaning the vaccines keep us from getting sick , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be infectious to others .\nUntil we know , don \u2019 t toss those masks into the trash\u2026 \u2026Andrew Badley , an immunovirologist who chairs Mayo Clinic \u2019 s covid-19 task force , says the return of any normal activities depends on numerous factors , including how many people get vaccinated .\n\u201c The only possibility that life will return to normal by summer is if the majority of the population receives the vaccines by then and the early efficacy data is borne out in ongoing studies , \u201d he says .\nHe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is unlikely we will be able to vaccinate the majority of the population by then.\n\u201d ( source ) And how will they make sure that \u201c the majority \u201d of the population gets the vaccines ?\nIt \u2019 ll start out easy \u2013 there are tons of people who will gladly roll up their sleeves to get a vaccination that was rushed to market with no testing on the long-term effects .\nAnd then , the rest of us will be coerced by being unable to go to work , to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into a public building without proof we \u2019 ve been vaccinated .\nYOU WALK TOWARD the arena , ready for a big game , tickets in hand .\nBut what you see is a long line wrapping around the corner of the building and a bottleneck at the entrance as people search their pockets and purses for a small piece of paper .\nTo be cleared to enter , you \u2019 ll also need that document\u2014proof that you \u2019 ve received a COVID-19 vaccination .\nThis is the future as some experts see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u2019 ll need to show you \u2019 ve been inoculated against the novel coronavirus to attend a sports game , get a manicure , go to work , or hop on a train .\n\u201c We \u2019 re not going to get to the point where the vaccine police break down your door to vaccinate you , \u201d says Arthur Caplan , a bioethicist at New York University \u2019 s School of Medicine .\nBut he and several other health policy experts envision vaccine mandates could be instituted and enforced by local governments @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for school-age children , military personnel , and hospital workers\u2026 \u2026The mandates can be directed toward customers , as well .\nJust as business owners can bar shoeless and shirtless clients from entering their restaurants , salons , arenas , and stores , they can legally keep people out for any number of reasons , \u201c as long as they \u2019 re not running afoul of any antidiscrimination laws , \u201d says Dorit Rubinstein Reiss , a professor of health and vaccine law at the University of California , Hastings College of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ available , some experts think states will require targeted industries to enforce vaccine mandates for their employees , especially those we \u2019 ve come to know as \u201c essential workers.\n\u201d \u201c Grocery store workers get exposed to a lot of people , but also have the chance to infect a lot of people because of the nature of their work and the fact that virtually everybody needs to buy food , \u201d says Carmel Shachar , executive director of the Petrie-Flom Center for Health Law Policy , Biotechnology , and Bioethics at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who work in restaurants , bars , and coffee shops , for example\u2014could also see similar mandates .\n\u201c It \u2019 s in an employer \u2019 s interest to make sure that their workplace is protected and that you can \u2019 t infect your colleagues , \u201d Shachar says .\n\u201c Having a widely accessible vaccine gets a lot of employers out of having to control their clients \u2019 behavior.\n\u201d And with a vaccinated workforce , \u201c you don \u2019 t need to worry if the people you \u2019 re serving at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ general public could be incentivized to get vaccinated .\n\u201c Oddly enough , the best way to impose a mandate is to reward people with more freedom if they follow that mandate , \u201d Caplan says .\nFor example , with proof of inoculation , you would be able to attend a sporting event \u201c as a reward for doing the right thing , \u201d he says .\n\u201c And I can imagine people saying , If you want to go to my restaurant , my bowling alley , or my tattoo parlor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vaccine certificate , too.\n\u201d Booster shots could also be required , depending on the efficacy of future vaccines .\n( source ) Doesn \u2019 t it just make you feel all warm and fuzzy inside how all these experts are planning to force an unwilling populace to accept an untested vaccine ?\nIt \u2019 s all for our own good , you know .\nRemember how we all used to joke about being put into FEMA camps ?\nWell\u2026..\nFinally , for those of us who believed these conspiracy theories were conspiracy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for Trump voters \u2013 there \u2019 s the discussion about how to

"DOJ Asserts it can Kill Anyone, Anywhere and Claim \u201cState Secrets\u201d", "content": "While the country was riveted on the fall-out from the election results\u2014one of the most divisive Presidential elections in recent history\u2014as well as engaged with concerns about more Covid lockdowns , the DOJ quietly went to a court in a significant civil rights case and declared that the US can kill anyone , anywhere and claim \u201c state secrets , \u201d thus avoiding any judicial review or due process .\nBilal Abdul Kareem , who is a US born journalist and has worked for the BBC and CNN , filed a case in federal court in 2017 alleging that he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kill list .\nThe pleadings cite at least four attempts on Kareem \u2019 s life in the Middle East , where he has been covering the conflict for a number of years .\nThese attempts involve targeted drone strikes as well as one attack on his personal vehicle apparently by a Hell Fire missile .\nThe citation of the Hell Fire is significant as this is a US weapon .\nIn September of 2019 , Judge Rosemary Collyer in US District Court dismissed Kareem \u2019 s case after the DOJ cited \u201c state @ @ @ @ @ @ @ s decision took place in DC Court of Appeals on November 16 , which you can listen to here .\nKareem \u2019 s attorney , Tara Plochocki , was first questioned as to the plausibility of the claim that Kareem himself was the target of the strikes , given that Kareem was working in a war zone .\nThe questioning then focused on the attorney for the Department of Justice , Brad Hinshelwood .\nThe judges asked him what potential remedy exists for a US citizen who is put on the kill list @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u201c state secrets \u201d privilege would also pertain for a target on US soil .\nAsserting the absolute privilege associated with \u201c state secrets , \u201d Mr. Hinshelwood suggests that Congress might want to pass some legislation .\nAt that time , circa 37 minutes in , one can hear one of the judges say , somewhat incredulously , \u201c He should try to get a bill passed ?\n\u201d The judge persists , saying \u201c My car keeps blowing up and I keep getting shot at\u2026and the government \u2019 s position is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rights , you have no capacity to get yourself off the list\u2026The government may execute me and there is nothing I can do about it ?\n\u201d DOJ attorney Hinshelwood responds : \u201c So an individual on the kill list\u2026in that circumstance\u2026given the courts competence to adjudicate claims\u2026there is no recourse.\n\u201d The implications of this stance are staggering .\nAs those working on legal reform issues know , American citizens are already being murdered through decisions handed down in probate guardianship proceedings .\nThe head count of those murdered by police , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ justice for the victims is rarely delivered .\nImmunity given to nursing homes over the high Covid death rate in these facilities also points to a perception that certain populations have less rights than others , including apparently the right to exist .\n\u201c State secrets \u201d constitutes an evidentiary rule rather than an Act of Congress .\nIt was used first in the 1953 landmark legal case , USA vs. Reynolds , that saw the formal recognition of the state secrets privilege , a judicially recognized extension of presidential power .\nSince @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attempts to introduce an official \u201c state secrets act.\n\u201d The most recent , HR 3332 , was introduced by Representative Jerrold Nadler and provided mechanisms by which the courts could determine if the claim of state secrets would affect a particular case .\nThe Nadler legislation \u201c Allows the government to : ( 1 ) assert the privilege in connection with any claim in a civil action to which it is a party , or ( 2 ) intervene in a civil action to which it is not a party in order @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gives the court some latitude in making this determination , stating that the court shall \u201c ( 1 ) undertake a preliminary review of the information in question , and ( 2 ) provide the government an opportunity to seek protective measures under this Act.\n\u201d This bill was referred to the Subcommittee on Crime , Terrorism , Homeland Security , and Investigations in January of 2014 and no action has been taken since .\nThe DC Circuit Court of Appeals \u2019 decision on the Kareem case is pending .\nSo while we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ might want to be mindful that , as far as our government is concerned , we have no

Manuals Are a Guide to Dystopia", "content": "A few years ago , when you saw a security camera , you may have thought that the video feed went to a VCR somewhere in a back office that could only be accessed when a crime occurs .\nOr maybe you imagined a sleepy guard who only paid half-attention , and only when they discovered a crime in progress .\nIn the age of internet-connectivity , now it \u2019 s easy to imagine footage sitting on a server somewhere , with any image inaccessible except to someone willing to fast forward through hundreds of hours of footage .\nThat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heist movies , and it may be how a homeowner still sorts through their own home security camera footage .\nBut that \u2019 s not how cameras operate in today \u2019 s security environment .\nInstead , advanced algorithms are watching every frame on every camera and documenting every person , animal , vehicle , and backpack as they move through physical space , and thus camera to camera , over an extended period of time .\nThe term \u201c video analytics \u201d seems boring , but don \u2019 t confuse it with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ YouTube \u201c how to poach an egg \u201d tutorial .\nIn a law enforcement or private security context , video analytics refers to using machine learning , artificial intelligence , and computer vision to automate ubiquitous surveillance .\nThrough the Atlas of Surveillance project , EFF has found more than 35 law enforcement agencies that use advanced video analytics technology .\nThat number is steadily growing as we discover new vendors , contracts , and capabilities .\nTo better understand how this software works , who uses it , and what it \u2019 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a number of user manuals .\nAnd yes , they are even scarier than we thought .\nBriefcam , which is often packaged with Genetec video technology , is frequently used at real-time crime centers .\nThese are police surveillance facilities that aggregate camera footage and other surveillance information from across a jurisdiction .\nDozens of police departments use Briefcam to search through hours of footage from multiple cameras in order to , for instance , narrow in on a particular face or a specific colored backpack .\nThis power of video analytic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to identify people out practicing their First Amendment right to protest .\nAvigilon systems are a bit more opaque , since they are often sold to business , which aren \u2019 t subject to the same transparency laws .\nIn San Francisco , for instance , Avigilon provides the cameras and software for at least six business improvement districts ( BIDs ) and Community Benefit Districts ( CBDs ) .\nThese districts blanket neighborhoods in surveillance cameras and relay the footage back to a central control room .\nAvigilon \u2019 s video analytics @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whether things are cars and people ) , license plate reading , and potentially face recognition .\nYou can read the Avigilon user manual here , and the Briefcam manual here .\nThe latter was obtained through the California Public Records Act by Dylan Kubeny , a student journalist at the University of Nevada , Reno Reynolds School of Journalism .\nBut what exactly are these software systems \u2019 capabilities ?\nHere \u2019 s what we learned : If you \u2019 re watching video footage on Briefcam , you can select any face @ @ @ @ @ @ @ watchlist.\n\u201d Then , with a few more clicks , you can retrieve every piece of video you have with that person \u2019 s face in it .\nBriefcam assigns all face images 1-3 stars .\nOne star : the AI can \u2019 t even recognize it as a person .\nTwo stars : medium confidence .\nThree stars : high confidence .\nAvigilon has a pair of algorithms that it uses to predict what it calls \u201c unusual events.\n\u201d The first can detect \u201c unusual motions , \u201d essentially patterns of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you \u2019 d normally expect in the scene .\nIt takes two weeks to train this self-learning algorithm .\nThe second can detect \u201c unusual activity \u201d involving cars and people .\nIt only takes a week to train .\nBecome an Activist Post Patron for $ 1 per month at Patreon .\nAlso , there \u2019 s \u201c Tampering Detection \u201d which , depending on how you set it , can be triggered by a moving shadow : Enter a value between 1-10 to select how sensitive a camera is to tampering @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the camera field of view , usually caused by someone unexpectedly moving the camera .\nLower the setting if small changes in the scene , like moving shadows , cause tampering events .\nIf the camera is installed indoors and the scene is unlikely to change , you can increase the setting to capture more unusual events .\nWith Briefcam \u2019 s shade filter , a person searching a crowd could filter by the color and length of items of clothing , accessories , or even hair .\nBriefcam \u2019 s manual @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crowd or a large collection of footage for someone with pink hair .\nIn addition , users of BriefCam can search specifically by what a person is wearing and other \u201c personal attributes.\n\u201d Law enforcement attempting to sift through crowd footage or hours of video could search for someone by specifying blue jeans or a yellow short-sleeved shirt .\nBriefCam sorts people and objects into specific categories to make them easier for the system to search for .\nBriefCam breaks people into the three categories of \u201c man , \u201d \u201c woman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ studies show that this type of categorization can misidentify gender nonconforming , nonbinary , trans , and disabled people whose bodies may not conform to the rigid criteria the software looks for when sorting people .\nSuch misidentification can have real-world harms , like triggering misguided investigations or denying access .\nThe software also breaks down other categories , including distinguishing between different types of vehicles and recognizing animals .\nIn addition to monitoring the total number of objects in a frame or the relative size of objects , BriefCam can detect proximity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ contact .\nThis might make BriefCam a prime candidate for \u201c COVID-19 washing , \u201d or rebranding invasive surveillance technology as a potential solution to the current public health crisis .\nAvigilon also claims it can detect skin temperature , raising another possible assertion of public health benefit .\nBut , as we \u2019 ve argued before , remote thermal imaging can often be very inaccurate , and fail to detect virus carriers that are asymptomatic .\nPublic health is a collective effort .\nDeploying invasive surveillance technologies that could easily be used @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is likely to breed more distrust of the government .\nThis will make public health collaboration less likely , not more .\nOne feature available both with Briefcam and Avigilon are watchlists , and we don \u2019 t mean a notebook full of names .\nInstead , the systems allow you to upload folders of faces and spreadsheets of license plates , and then the algorithm will find matches and track the targets \u2019 movement .\nThe underlying watchlists can be extremely problematic .\nFor example , EFF has looked at hundreds of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( ALPRs ) and it is very rare for an agency to describe the rules for adding someone to a watchlist .\nOften , ALPRs are associated with England , the birthplace of the technology , and the United States , where it has metastasized .\nBut Avigilon already has its sights set on new markets and has programmed its technology to identify license plates across six continents .\nIt \u2019 s worth noting that Avigilon is owned by Motorola Solutions , the same company that operates the infamous ALPR provider Vigilant Solutions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dangerous time .\nThe lack of oversight of police acquisition and use of surveillance technology has dangerous consequences for those misidentified or caught up in the self-fulfilling prophecies of AI policing .\nIn fact , Dr. Rashall Brackney , the Charlottesville Police Chief , described these video analytics as perpetuating racial bias at a recent panel .\nVideo analytics \u201c are often incorrect , \u201d she said .\n\u201c Over and over they create false positives in identifying suspects.\n\u201d This new era of video analytics capabilities causes at least two problems .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ more on this secretive technology to dictate who to investigate and arrest by , for instance , identifying the wrong hooded and backpacked suspect .\nSecond , people who attend political or religious gatherings will justifiably fear being identified , tracked , and punished .\nOver a dozen cities across the United States have banned government use of face recognition , and that \u2019 s a great start .\nBut this only goes so far .\nSurveillance companies are already planning ways to get around these bans by using other types of video @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is the time to push for more comprehensive legislation to defend our civil liberties and hold police accountable .\nTo learn more about Real-Time Crime Centers , read our

involving mail-in voting throughout the nation , not to mention issues having to do with the electronic voting machines used along with its software .\nAre Biden supporters correct when they say there is no credible evidence , and that all assertions are conspiratorial , unconstitutional , far-fetched , and flimsy ?\n\u201c The existence of technical flaws does not establish that an attack occurred , much less that it altered an election outcome , \u201d wrote a group of scientists , including Matt Blaze McDevitt , Professor of Computer Science @ @ @ @ @ @ @ signers of the letter also stated

the allegations being made need to be investigated for Americans to have confidence in this election and future ones , \u201d adds Trey Trainor , Commissioner , and current Chairman Federal Election Commission ( FEC ) , an independent regulatory agency charged with administering and enforcing the federal campaign finance laws .\nEvery American should freely be able to ask questions about the legitimacy of the election @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and suspect that Big Tech has chosen the path of censorship , while the mainstream is busy ignoring , projecting , dismissing , and discarding .\nOne statistician told me in confidence that he no longer wishes to go on the record due to threats and admonishment .\n\u201c What is going on in this country ( in terms of election fraud ) is horrible & the censorship you ( MSM/big tech ) are imposing is making it worse , \u201d Rudy Giuliani said in a presser November 19th .\n\u201c The coverage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as the scheme itself.\n\u201d Tired of the misguided efforts trying to distort reality ?\nWhat happens when both sides ask you the very same thing ?\nAfter poring over hundreds of articles , reading affidavits signed under perjury of law , lawsuits , conducting interviews , reviewing this crowdsourcing tool for journalists along with this comprehensive document , and watching canvasser Zoom calls , I can attest there is enough \u201c evidence \u201d to at the very least entertain the possibility of irregularities on a massive scale .\nIn a recent commentary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ writes , \u201c Stealing the 2020 election was a mammoth undertaking , involving widespread lawlessness and illicit partnerships between private actors and public officials.\n\u201d That \u2019 s quite a far cry from this election being Fort Knox safe .\nBefore we take a deeper dive , please consider this is a fast moving train .\nIn Part One , we looked at an overview of potential election fraud .\nIn this follow-up , we delve in the media , Dominion , and the mania involving mail-in voting .\nIn future series , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the battle states of MI , PA , GA , and NV .\nIncidentally , these swing states all used the Dominion Voting Systems .\nThese states are also where Trump has filed suits .\nLet \u2019 s face it , we are in this veritable election mess due to the Rona , which fueled the verve for mail-in voting .\nExcept wait , Rona is a psyop .\nDespite the mainstream media and COVID19 Task Force \u2019 s narrative , the coronavirus is less fatal than the flu with a 99.6 % @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made possible by the non-diagnostic PCR tool rife with false positives .\nFor a moment , consider this as truth against the backdrop of hypocrisy , from not only leaders like Nancy Pelosi and their non-masked behavior , but in our

.\nWas the coronavirus used to alter and eliminate laws put in place over the course of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ballot box ?\nStumbling upon hundreds and hundreds of filed lawsuits involving election administration issues linked to the coronavirus outbreak supports this possibility .\n\u201c There have been more lawsuits filed this year before the election trying to change election rules than I \u2019 ve ever seen before , \u201d Hans von Spakovsky , a senior legal fellow at the Heritage Foundation , has said .\n\u201c They \u2019 ve been trying to take advantage of COVID-19 to get the changes they \u2019 ve wanted for years into election rules.\n\u201d Trainer agrees @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all the mail-in voting , which is rife with potential fraud , he says .\n\u201c On the surface , \u2018 vote-by-mail \u2019 sounds like a quick and easy way for every registered voter to participate in our democracy .\nIn reality , it opens the U.S. to fraudulent elections on a massive scale that will probably result in invalid results , contested elections , and delays lasting weeks , if not months , \u201d he wrote in an October Op Ed titled Vote by Mail : The Unintended Consequences .\n\u201c Certain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ work to weaken laws that give way to voter fraud , \u201d adds a Republican who oversees a voter integrity non-profit .\nThe man , who wished to remain anonymous , says the main election firm behind these suits is Perkins Coie , run by Marc Elias , the same firm that served as the passthrough for the Steele Dossier .\nHe adds that the Clinton campaign has given money to Perkins Coie .\nThis is also the same law firm that is now defending Dominion .\nOn their website , Perkins Coie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ promoting \u201c safeguards that are necessary to prevent voter disenfranchisement.\n\u201d To learn more , check out Democracy Docket , a platform run by Elias \u201c for progressive advocacy and information about voting rights , elections , redistricting and democracy .\nWhat is the conclusion when you factor in the modification of election laws due to covid19 , mail-in voter-related irregularities , and vulnerabilities with the electronic Dominion Voting System ?\nThe Dominion Voting Systems ( DVS ) ballot-counting system was reportedly used in 28 states during the election and contains Chinese-made hardware @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ballot software .\n( You can go to the U.S. Election Assistance Commission ( EAC ) to see what states use what voting machines . )\nWhile Dominion says it is a nonpartisan company , it has acknowledged connections with the Clinton Global Initiative .\nDominion \u2019 s first-ever lobbying firm is Brownstein Farber Hyatt & Schreck .\nNadeam Elshami , Nancy Pelosi \u2019 s former chief of staff , is one of the lobbyists on the account .\nThe company is based out of Toronto , Canada , with its Sysctl servers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ties , can Trump \u2019 s Executive Order 13848 , \u201c Imposing Certain Sanctions in the Event of Foreign Interference in a United States Election , \u201d be used to legally call into question this election ?\n\u201c It \u2019 s a foreign company , no matter how you look at it , so they \u2019 ve already violated the President \u2019 s order against foreign interference in our elections , \u201d Powell said in reference to Dominion Voting Systems .\n\u201c Our votes were actually eventually counted in Barcelona , Spain or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The mainstream media and the left are painting this as conspiratorial .\nYet foreign interference or not , electronic voting also comes with its vulnerabilities .\nThe potential for abusing these machines is not new .\nFourteen years ago , Lou Dobbs covered a story for CNN titled Smartmatic Based in Venezuela Sold to Sequoia , Top Officials Still in Venezuela , Before Sale to Dominion .\nWhy didn \u2019 t he mention this to Sidney Powell or his thousands of viewers this month ?\nIs this a recycled storyline that banks on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ramsland \u2019 s affidavit explains that the Dominion Voting System has options \u201c to be an electronic paperless voting system with no permanent record of the voter \u2019 s choices , paper ballot based systems , or a hybrid of those two.\n\u201d \u201c An update file didn \u2019 t properly synchronize the ballot barcode generation and reading portions of the system .\nIf that is indeed the case , there is no reason to assume this would be an isolated error , \u201d reads the affidavit .\nIn a video , reportedly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( a man who has expressed his disdain for Trump and allegiance to Antifa ) demonstrates how Dominion \u2019 s voting machines and software works .\nOne feature , he explains , is the ability to manually enter votes .\nA feature Dominion calls \u201c adjudication.\n\u201d Coomer says this feature is meant to be used when a voter doesn \u2019 t mark the ballot correctly and the machine can not read which candidate was selected .\nIf this happens , an operator can \u201c adjudicate \u201d the ballot .\nThis means they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ voter meant to choose .\nBoth Dominion and Smartmatic , its subsidiary , Sequoia Voting Systems have dismissed concerns over their systems .\nThey refute all allegations hinting at insecure voting processes .\nSmartmatic posted a tweet this week , outright denying their transfer of technology to Dominion voting systems .\nSmartmatic may deny ties to Dominion Voting Systems , but in a 2015 interview about Smartmatic \u2019 s role in the Philippines elections , Chairman Malloch-Brown admitted to a licensing agreement with Dominion .\nSmartmatic was started in Caracas but disingenuously described @ @ @ @ @ @ @ office in Boca Raton .\nMeanwhile , Syctl ( partnered with Microsoft ) also \u201c strongly denies the fake news and maintains they don \u2019 t provide any electronic voting machines to US jurisdictions & do NOT tabulate , tally or count votes in US elections.\n\u201d Syctl is a

can Kill Anyone, Anywhere and Claim \u201cState Secrets\u201d", "content": "While the country was riveted on the fall-out from the election results\u2014one of the most divisive Presidential elections in recent history\u2014as well as engaged with concerns about more Covid lockdowns , the DOJ quietly went to a court in a significant civil rights case and declared that the US can kill anyone , anywhere and claim \u201c state secrets , \u201d thus avoiding any judicial review or due process .\nBilal Abdul Kareem , who is a US born journalist and has worked for the BBC and CNN , filed a case in federal court in 2017 alleging that he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kill list .\nThe pleadings cite at least four attempts on Kareem \u2019 s life in the Middle East , where he has been covering the conflict for a number of years .\nThese attempts involve targeted drone strikes as well as one attack on his personal vehicle apparently by a Hellfire missile .\nThe citation of the Hellfire is significant as this is a US weapon .\nIn September of 2019 , Judge Rosemary Collyer in US District Court dismissed Kareem \u2019 s case after the DOJ cited \u201c state secrets.\n\u201d @ @ @ @ @ @ @ took place in DC Court of Appeals on November 16 , which you can listen to here .\nKareem \u2019 s attorney , Tara Plochocki , was first questioned as to the plausibility of the claim that Kareem himself was the target of the strikes , given that Kareem was working in a war zone .\nThe questioning then focused on the attorney for the Department of Justice , Brad Hinshelwood .\nThe judges asked him what potential remedy exists for a US citizen who is put on the kill list .\nThe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ secrets \u201d privilege would also pertain for a target on US soil .\nAsserting the absolute privilege associated with \u201c state secrets , \u201d Mr. Hinshelwood suggests that Congress might want to pass some legislation .\nAt that time , circa 37 minutes in , one can hear one of the judges say , somewhat incredulously , \u201c He should try to get a bill passed ?\n\u201d The judge persists , saying \u201c My car keeps blowing up and I keep getting shot at\u2026and the government \u2019 s position is , tough @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you have no capacity to get yourself off the list\u2026The government may execute me and there is nothing I can do about it ?\n\u201d DOJ attorney Hinshelwood responds : \u201c So an individual on the kill list\u2026in that circumstance\u2026given the courts competence to adjudicate claims\u2026there is no recourse.\n\u201d The implications of this stance are staggering .\nAs those working on legal reform issues know , American citizens are already being murdered through decisions handed down in probate guardianship proceedings .\nThe head count of those murdered by police , annually , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the victims is rarely delivered .\nImmunity given to nursing homes over the high Covid death rate in these facilities also points to a perception that certain populations have less rights than others , including apparently the right to exist .\n\u201c State secrets \u201d constitutes an evidentiary rule rather than an Act of Congress .\nIt was used first in the 1953 landmark legal case , USA vs. Reynolds , that saw the formal recognition of the state secrets privilege , a judicially recognized extension of presidential power .\nSince that time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ introduce an official \u201c state secrets act.\n\u201d The most recent , HR 3332 , was introduced by Representative Jerrold Nadler and provided mechanisms by which the courts could determine if the claim of state secrets would affect a particular case .\nThe Nadler legislation \u201c Allows the government to : ( 1 ) assert the privilege in connection with any claim in a civil action to which it is a party , or ( 2 ) intervene in a civil action to which it is not a party in order to do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ court some latitude in making this determination , stating that the court shall \u201c ( 1 ) undertake a preliminary review of the information in question , and ( 2 ) provide the government an opportunity to seek protective measures under this Act.\n\u201d This bill was referred to the Subcommittee on Crime , Terrorism , Homeland Security , and Investigations in January of 2014 and no action has been taken since .\nThe DC Circuit Court of Appeals \u2019 decision on the Kareem case is pending .\nSo while we are celebrating @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be mindful that , as far as our government is concerned , we have no more rights than the turkey on the table .\nJanet Phelan

American country to becoming the largest legal marijuana market in the world .\nJust days prior to the Thanksgiving holiday in the U.S. , Mexico \u2019 s Senate approved a bill that would put an end to prohibition measures in a landslide vote of 82 to 18 , with seven abstentions .\nLawmakers in the ruling Morena party have been working hard to seal the approval of the landmark cannabis legalization bill before the current congressional session draws to a close in December .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ majorities in both chambers of Congress .\nThe bill is designed to \u201c improve living conditions \u201d and \u201c contribute to the reduction of crime linked to drug trafficking , \u201d according to its text .\nThe move would amount to a huge U-turn after decades of anti-drug policies led to the explosive growth of transnational cartels \u2013 and ferocious local cartel wars \u2013 in Mexico .\nIn recent years , violence related to drug cartels has claimed upwards of 10,000 lives .\nAdvocates of legalization in Mexico have long argued that legalizing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ advance alternative drug policies , halt the criminalization of drug users and refocus its security efforts to better address public health .\nThe demands of advocates came significantly closer to being realized in 2018 , when the Mexican Supreme Court ruled that recreational marijuana should be permitted .\nOne year prior , legislators voted to legalize the plant for medical purposes .\nWhile Mexico has a long and storied history of cannabis usage , the consumption of the plant is still not as culturally accepted on a widespread level as in the United @ @ @ @ @ @ @ legal commercial markets for the sale and purchase of the plan will likely displace the large systems of illicit cultivation in the country .\nSocially conservative Mexican President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador , popularly known by his initials AMLO , has largely shied away from vocally supporting the legalization of the plant .\nHowever , Lopez Obrador has long endorsed the need to radically reform the country \u2019 s laws to put an end to rampant drug violence in Mexico , where drug cartels still hold sway over the illicit trade of narcotics @ @ @ @ @ @ @ t been an outspoken champion of legalization efforts , members of his center-left party such as Senate leader Ricardo Monreal and senior cabinet members like Interior Minister Olga Sanchez have been clear in their calls to open the doors to legalizing and regulating the recreational usage of cannabis .\nUnder the proposed measures , Mexico would place strict controls on ownership and the supply chain used for domestic production and international commerce of cannabis .\nThe trade surrounding the industry would also have to comply with various forms of financial source verification , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fall into the hands of criminal syndicates , writes Forbes .\nUnder the bill , adults over 18 will be allowed to cultivate and possess up to 28 grams of cannabis for personal use .\nPossession of up to 200 grams would also be decriminalized .\nIndividuals would be allowed to grow up to 20 plants provided their annual yield isn \u2019 t in excess of 480 grams .\nMedical patients would be able to grow over 20 plants , if necessary .\nPublic consumption of cannabis would also be allowed in all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ percent smoke-free.\n\u201d Cannabis sales would also be subject to a 12 percent tax , with revenue going toward drug abuse programs .\nThe new laws and regulations would be enforced and overseen by the Mexican Institute of Regulation and Control of Cannabis .\nAdvocates have also expressed caution about moving forward while taking into account social equity concerns and safeguards to prevent transnational corporations from monopolizing the massive , burgeoning weed market in the North American country .\nThe success of these efforts would make Mexico the largest country in the world @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nWith a population

"Globalists Poised for a \u201cGreat Reset\u201d \u2014 Any Role for Gold?", "content": "Although the apparent results of the 2020 election are still being contested , members of the global ruling elite are already looking forward to a post-Trump era in American politics \u2013 and a post-vaccine world economy .\nThey have encapsulated their policy agenda for 2021 and beyond into two words : \u201c Great Reset.\n\u201d The notion of a Great Reset comes directly from the World Economic Forum .\nThe globalist organization has been actively pushing it for months via a series of policy articles on its web site .\nThe Great Reset agenda entails \u201c harnessing the fourth industrial @ @ @ @ @ @ @ map of the world \u201d in pursuit of an \u201c energy transition \u201d that makes \u201c economies more sustainable \u201d while advancing \u201c equity , inclusion and social justice in the workplace \u201d so that the global economy can \u201c build back better.\n\u201d In essence , the Great Reset is every longstanding globalist priority rolled into one and put on an accelerated path to full implementation .\nEarlier this month , Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau , speaking to a United Nations video conference , said , \u201c This pandemic has provided @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our chance to accelerate our pre-pandemic efforts to reimagine economic systems that actually address global challenges like extreme poverty , inequality and climate change.\n\u201d As both Winston Churchill and Rahm Emanuel said , \u201c never let a good crisis go to waste.\n\u201d So what would a Great Reset mean for the monetary system ?\nIt certainly wouldn \u2019 t mean a resetting of the U.S. dollar or any other national or regional fiat currencies to a gold standard .\nInstead , the Great Reset that globalists have in mind would give @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and draconian environmental and social justice objectives that have traditionally been outside the scope of their mandates .\nThe Federal Reserve recently signaled its participation in the Great Reset by joining the Network for Greening the Financial System ( NGFS ) , a global group of central banks and regulatory bodies dedicated to implementing the Paris climate agreement and other \u201c green \u201d priorities .\nThe Fed \u2019 s \u201c dual mandate \u201d of stable prices and full employment is now effectively an unlimited mandate .\nIt includes raising price levels to impose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ savers .\nBecome an Activist Post Patron for $ 1 per month at Patreon .\nSome gold bugs imagine a scenario where the Fed abuses its currency creating powers to the point where the public loses confidence in the U.S. dollar , forcing the authorities to back it with gold at some extraordinarily elevated price .\nThe coming great monetary reset is unlikely to play out that way , however .\nCentral bankers and Keynesian economists dogmatically believe their theories are superior to a sound money system .\nThey are more likely to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( perhaps merged with a global currency regime ) that is delinked from anything tangible , including coins and paper bills .\nGold \u2019 s role in the monetary system post-Great Reset will be to reflect its excesses and failures .\nIn fact , the precious metal has been playing such a role ever since the U.S. moved to a purely fiat Federal Reserve note .\nWhen the last vestiges of the classical gold standard were rescinded in 1971 , gold prices traded in the low $ 40s per ounce .\nEarlier this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to record high prices above $ 2,000 .\nGold prices have risen 50x over the past 50 years as a reflection of the loss of the dollar \u2019 s purchasing power .\nThus , a de facto gold standard is still in force \u2013 and will continue to be regardless of what the Great Reset brings .\nThose who own precious metals are effectively making a Great Escape from the global fiat regime entirely and resetting their purchasing power in sound money .\nIt will more reliably preserve purchasing power in the years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ banker-issued paper or digits .\nStefan Gleason is President of Money Metals Exchange , a precious metals dealer recently named

"The Chinese Coronavirus ( COVID-19 ) hit American shores \u2014 officially , anyway , there is significant evidence that it arrived earlier \u2014 in late January 2020 .\nThe American public was then told that a two-week shutdown of the economy would \u201c flatten the curve , \u201d relieving the pressure on hospital intensive care units and saving lives in the long run .\nThe average American , including conservatives , being people of good faith , complied , thinking that this was a common-sense measure that would save lives in the wake of a new and mysterious pandemic .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the goalposts moved .\nNo longer was it enough to \u201c flatten the curve.\n\u201d Now we were to be locked down until there was a cure .\nEven the cure was not enough for some figures like the lionized-by-liberals Dr. Anthony Fauci \u2014 we would continue to be locked down even after a vaccine had been rammed through the approvals process with limited testing .\nWhen would we be allowed out by our masters ?\nNo one could answer this .\nSecond , there was an intensification of the authoritarian measures @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tech , introduced \u201c contact tracing \u201d where people had to sign in with extensive personal information if they wanted to , for example , eat out at a restaurant .\nThis was so that , in the event of infection with COVID-19 , the state health department would be able to track and trace everyone you had contact with .\nWe should add that a third thing didn \u2019 t so much \u201c happen \u201d but was discovered : As it turns out unless you are old ( over the age of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from a complicating disorder ( such as diabetes or asthma ) , COVID-19 was little more than a bad cold or the flu .\nWhat \u2019 s more , there was a financial incentive from the government to mark deaths as COVID-19 deaths when they were not .\nGeorge Floyd , the man who died while being arrested by the Minneapolis Police Department , sparking riots over the summer of 2020 , is officially a COVID-19 death because he died with COVID-19 , despite not dying of COVID-19 .\nBy the fall of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ While COVID-19 was dangerous for select populations , it had an extremely low death rate among the young and healthy .\nThe generous or naive might say that the COVID-19 health measures are misguided attempts to protect the population .\nA more hard-nosed or cynical person likely thinks that these measures are a deliberate attempt to enact totalitarian measures leveraging public panic .\nThis , of course , would not be the first time the government and its toadies took advantage of such a panic , with the 9/11 attacks presenting a recent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ COVID-19 measures are little more than a cynical power grab .\nWe also believe that they have no basis in \u201c the science \u201d often breathlessly invoked by the toadies of this power grab .\nIn this article , we will make a compelling case that there is nothing scientific about this attack on the individual civil liberties of Americans .\nAs Canadian Dr. Roger Hodkinson , a top pathologist , virologist , and CEO of a biotech company manufacturing COVID tests said , \u201c this ( COVID-19 ) is the greatest hoax @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Who Is Hurt By Lockdowns\u2026 And Who Isn \u2019 t ?\nBefore launching into specifics about \u201c the science \u201d of lockdowns , it is worth discussing who was impacted by lockdowns and who wasn \u2019 t .\nDespite the rhetoric from the political and media class about how \u201c we are all in this together , \u201d there is clearly no \u201c we \u201d and there are different impacts on different people .\nFirst , let \u2019 s discuss the American and international media elites .\nThese jobs are largely done remotely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ performed so , can easily be transitioned to be done remotely .\nThen there is the small matter of the political class of bureaucrats who receive their paychecks whether they perform any ostensible \u201c work \u201d \u2014 to say nothing of obtaining results \u2014 or not .\nUnsurprisingly , these are two groups heavily invested in both lockdowns and in policing the behavior of ordinary citizens .\nCompare with the working- and middle-class Americans who do not see a dime unless they actually show up to work , work which often can not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rules of the lockdowns .\nWhile one can write clickbait articles about how anti-mask and anti-lockdown protesters are agents of white supremacy from the comfort of one \u2019 s own home , the same can not be said for tasks like construction , manufacturing , many forms of retail sales or hospitality .\nThis isn \u2019 t just a matter of a few people missing out on a few weeks of work .\nCNBC host Jim Cramer has noted that the Chinese Coronavirus pandemic led to one of the biggest wealth transfers in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cleaned up at the expense of Main Street .\nSmall businesses shuttered at an astonishing rate with restaurants and retailers hardest hit .\nAll told , 60 percent of business closures were expected to be permanent , for a total of over 100,000 businesses .\nWhile Main Street businesses were locked down , Amazon was making a killing \u2014 all while Jeff Bezos \u2019 vanity blog , the Washington Post was pushing lockdown policies .\nWalmart , Lowe \u2019 s , and Target were likewise seeing booming profits .\nThis is emblematic of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Main Street businesses to Big Tech and the financial sector .\nIndeed , the tale of the Chinese coronavirus in total might well be described as a massive upward consolidation of power .\nThe point of all this is to point out that there is a massive social and economic cost to the lockdowns that is borne entirely by the plebeians and not at all by the political and media elites who push the lockdowns hard .\nBecome an Activist Post Patron for $ 1 per month at Patreon .\nPeople \u2019 s @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nAnd while the projected increase in suicide rates has thus far failed to materialize , why does someone have to kill themselves for us to be concerned about how COVID-19 has impacted their lives ?\nFurther , we have evidence that people die of \u201c despair \u201d \u2014 effectively giving up on life and failing to perform adequate self-care , overdosing on drugs or other similar types of deaths \u2014 at an alarming rate during the pandemic lockdowns .\nIndeed , there is even a mathematical formula for this , whereby there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for every 1 percent of unemployment .\nUnemployment during COVID lockdowns peaked at 14.7 percent , which would be an expected excess death total of between 77,910 and 147,000 .\nThe COVID lockdowns of spring 2020 saw an uptick in a number of other serious conditions .\nIncreased suicide was one , but also drug overdoses , alcohol-related illness , tuberculosis infections and on the non-lethal side of things , increased alcohol abuse generally as well as increased spousal and child abuse .\nDelayed cancer screenings were another problem during the lockdowns .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ medicine , believes that there are tens of thousands of deaths related to delayed treatment because of COVID alone .\nConservative news and opinion website Revolver has conducted an extensive study of just how impacted American quality of life has been by COVID lockdowns , in terms of actual months of life lost .\nThey concluded that over 10 times as much life has been lost due to COVID lockdowns than due to the disease itself .\nThe Revolver study is largely based on \u201c back of the envelope \u201d type calculations , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a sense of the scope of how COVID-19 lockdowns have negatively impacted the lives of Americans significantly more than the disease itself .\nThe Great Barrington Declaration , signed by over 7,000 scientists , virologists , and infectious disease experts believes that lockdowns are destroying \u201c at least seven times as much life \u201d as the disease itself and that in the United States and the United Kingdom , there is \u201c irreparable damage \u201d being done .\nThe declaration notes clearly that \u201c seven times as much damage \u201d is the absolute @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at 90 times .\nThere is another metric worth mentioning in our quest to quantify how bad the lockdown has been for non-sick people .\nGlobal debt has ballooned , growing by $ 20 trillion since the lockdowns began , according to the Institute of International Finance .\nThis is thought to be the biggest increase in debt in the world \u2019 s history Perhaps worst of all , none of this is ever explained to the public as being necessary .\nIt is simply not acknowledged at all .\nIt is an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that any measure that will prevent even a single death is worth it no matter what the social or economic consequences .\nHow Dangerous Is COVID ?\nNot Very .\nOn the flip side of this are the large number of \u201c COVID deaths \u201d which are actually attributable to some other cause .\nWe \u2019 re not talking about an elderly person with chronic obstructive pulmonary disorder pushed over the edge by the Chinese Coronavirus .\nWe \u2019 re talking about people who died of gunshot wounds , got into motorcycle accidents @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a drug-related heart attack while a police officer kneeled on their neck who were counted as COVID deaths .\nWith fat government subsidies for COVID cases , it \u2019 s unsurprising that hospitals and other healthcare facilities would diagnose people as having COVID who actually did not .\nWe know very little about COVID and how it is spread , but here are a few things we do know : First , we know that there are a number of comorbidities that make it far more dangerous , one of which is obesity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ death by a whopping 48 percent .\nBut even that might not be as dangerous as it first sounds : In California where they have had 18,000 deaths , a scant two of these were people under the age of 18 , one with underlying health conditions .\nA much more important factor is age .\nA large study conducted on data from cases in South Korea , Italy , China , and Spain , three of the early breeding grounds for the virus , found a 0 percent death rate for those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ death rate didn \u2019 t climb above 1 percent until the age of 50-59 \u2014 and then only in China and Italy and then only just barely , at 1.3 and 1 percent respectively .\nIt climbed slightly above 1 percent for all four countries in the 60-69 age bracket , staying below 2 percent in South Korea and Spain , but below 4 percent for Italy and China .\nDeath rates then spike dramatically over the age of 70 .\nThis tracks with flu deaths over the 2017-18 \u201c flu season \u201d @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deaths under the age of 18 ( a little over 600 ) , slightly more for 18-49 ( 2803 ) , another modest jump between 50 and 64 ( 6,751 ) and then a huge spike over the age of 65 ( over 50,000 ) .\nOf course , there are more cases of the flu , which has a lower death rate overall : The overall death rate for COVID-19 is 1.5 percent , regardless of age , with an average season \u2019 s flu killing about .1 percent of everyone who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we \u2019 re finding that there \u2019 s absolutely nothing to be concerned about for most healthy people .\nThe COVID survival rates according to the CDC are 99.997 percent for those under the age of 20 , 99.98 percent for those between the ages of 20 and 49 , 99.5 percent for those between the age of 50 and 69 and even 94.6 percent for those over the age of 70 .\nThese numbers include people with comorbidities such as respiratory diseases .\nAnd even these numbers are likely off , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are attributed to COVID alone .\nThe rest had , on average , at least two comorbidities .\nThe average death rate annually for the flu is about .1 percent .\nIt \u2019 s worth noting that this data all comes from the early stages of the pandemic when medical professionals had little way of treating the disease other than ventilating \u2014 and thus , probably killing \u2014 severe cases .\nNow we know quite a bit more about therapeutics that aid in recovery .\nPresident Donald Trump , a clinically obese 74-year-old @ @ @ @ @ @ @ less than a week .\nThere is ample evidence that the disease is becoming less deadly , not more .\nDeath rates fall because of increased testing , but the median age of infection has likewise gone down .\nDo Lockdowns And Masks Even Work ?\nAll of this raises an important central question : Why do the elderly , those with underlying health conditions and the obese simply sequester themselves or take reasonable precautions rather than shutting down the world economy ?\nIndeed , there is mounting evidence that government intervention has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ things worse .\nAs of November 18 , 2020 , there have been 34,058 COVID deaths in the state of New York .\nOf these , over 6,500 ( or approximately one in seven total deaths ) were nursing home deaths that were a direct result of Governor Andrew Cuomo \u2019 s policy of forcing nursing homes to accept COVID patients and lock them down with the vulnerable and uninfected .\nThis is a concrete example of government lockdown measures killing people .\nBut you won \u2019 t hear about it in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ masks that we are now seeing everywhere to the point where someone without a mask is seen as the strange one .\nThey must work , of course !\nBut there is scant evidence that masks prevent the transmission of COVID or any other respiratory infection .\nIn every randomized clinical trial ever conducted , there have been inconclusive findings that mask wearing aided in suppressing transmission of respiratory diseases .\nStudies generally rely upon fitted N95 respirators that must be sterilized after every use or surgical masks that should be thrown away @ @ @ @ @ @ @ masks cause headaches than that they prevent against COVID .\nCompare this to what you see on your average trip to the grocery store : People wearing unfitted cloth masks that get occasionally cleaned \u2014 maybe .\nMany people don \u2019 t even bother to pull them up over their noses .\nThus , most mask wearing is useless and little more than a form of social control or forced act of \u201c solidarity.\n\u201d There \u2019 s magical thinking involved in the current mask mandates : If cases go up , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good little boys and girls and didn \u2019 t wear their masks .\nIf they go down , everyone has been well behaved and gets to pat themselves on the back for wearing their face diaper .\nSome evidence suggests that masks make people feel magically protected from the virus and thus they do not take common-sense precautions against all disease , such as handwashing , keeping fingers off the face , covering their nose when they sneeze and the like .\nWhat this means at its root is that people are trading @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reuse likewise increases infection rates and who among us isn \u2019 t guilty of that ?\nWhat \u2019 s more , studies suggest that people who wear the cloth masks , that are now virtually required to do anything outside one \u2019 s home , lead to an increase of flu-like symptoms \u2014 and thus create lots of COVID paranoia where there ought not to be any .\nIt was only in March that many experts were urging people not to wear masks at all , with this article from April likewise urging @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are also the \u201c soft \u201d effects of mask wearing .\nThere is significant evidence to suggest that children living under COVID will have their emotional and psychological development severely stunted and warped thanks to mask orders .\nAs if you needed another reason to pull your kids out of public school .\nIndeed , we have a mountain of troubling data about the social effects of mass mask wearing that go back decades .\nPut simply , masks make people stupid , pliant and anti-social .\nExamples of findings from mask studies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people were more likely and required less pay to carry a sign reading \u201c masturbation is fun \u201d if they were masked .\n\u2022 A 1979 study found children were more likely to take more than their allotted amount of Halloween candy if they were masked .\n\u2022 A 1989 study found that masking led people to abandon defense mechanism and revert to more primitive psychological states .\n\u2022 Studies conducted in 2005 and 2017 found neurological evidence inhibit both impulse control and identity formation , decreasing prefrontal cortex activity .\n\u2022 Repeated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flow to the brain .\nA number of public figures have backed off of masking as a panacea , instead pushing it as an act of \u201c social solidarity.\n\u201d Sure , masks might not actually do anything \u2014 but what about feelings ?\nBritish politicians Michael Gove and Nicole Sturgeon are indicative of this trend .\nYour Social Betters Are Not Actually Afraid of COVID But perhaps the best evidence that this is all just a bit of political theater is seeing how our media and political class actually behave when they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cuomo , brother of Governor Andrew Cuomo , often referred to as \u201c Fredo \u201d due to paling in comparison with his brother , was quarantined for two weeks , not for abstract reasons , but because he was actually exposed to COVID .\nThis didn \u2019 t stop him from leaving his house unmasked after he got tired of lifting fake weights on camera .\nBill De Blasio , the Mayor of New York with questionable connections to Communist organizations and a daughter in Antifa , was caught at the gym and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of shame about it , explaining that he needs to go to the gym , but you do not .\nLori Lightfoot , Mayor of Chicago , told Chicagoans to stay home for Thanksgiving .\nThis didn \u2019 t stop her from taking to the streets following Joe Biden \u2019 s ersatz \u201c victory \u201d in the 2020 Presidential election to celebrate .\nGavin Newsome , Governor of California has presided over some of the harshest lockdowns in the nation , going so far as to shut off power and water to people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ somehow finds time to dine out at the three Michelin star restaurant French Laundry with some of the top medical bureaucrats in the state .\nHe \u2019 s not the only governor who believes in \u201c lockdowns for thee , but not for me.\n\u201d Gretchen Whitmer from Michigan went as far as to threaten lockdown protesters with further lockdowns because of their protests .\nShe is a bit of a poster child for the mediocre people who have appointed themselves COVID cops .\nWhitmer put in some of the most restrictive lockdowns @ @ @ @ @ @ @ use them to blackmail Michiganders into voting for Joe Biden .\nIn November , she began threatening jail time for businesses who did not record personal details of their customers for her personal perusal .\nHer husband attempted to throw his weight around to get his boat moved into place for vacation early in violation of state orders .\nNancy Pelosi \u2019 s lockdown-violating haircut is well known .\nLess known is that she planned to carry on with the reception dinner for new members of Congress until her plan was exposed and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and other political elites were telling average Americans to skip Thanksgiving and Christmas .\nThe elephant in the room , of course , were the BLM riots of the summer of 2020 .\nIn cities such as New York , Portland ( where riots literally went on every night for months ) , and Seattle ( where insurrectionists took over several blocks of the capitol district and demanded ethnic cleansing of whites from the area ) , there were leftist riots growing out of a media manufactured panic centered around the death of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a drug overdose while resisting arrest and whose death is officially listed as COVID .\nThese riots were fine , indeed necessary and it wasn \u2019 t just politicians who were saying so .\nThe medical profession also chimed in , predictably declaring that \u201c racism \u201d was the \u201c real pandemic.\n\u201d Compare with the reaction to anti-lockdown protests .\nThose seeking a consolidation of power upward in the form of breaking police unions and disbanding local police departments , who terrorized small businesses and local communities , not just in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ places like Kenosha , Wisconsin and Lancaster , Pennsylvania \u2014 the latter of these sensibly held rioters on $ 1 million bail .\nThe message is simple and clear : Freedom fighters are superspreaders .\nThe freelance goons of government repression and Big Tech labor discipline enforcement are free to do as they will .\nTheir \u201c protests \u201d aren \u2019 t just safe , but vitally important .\nThere is no other term for the COVID regime than a nascent police state .\nGovernors and bureaucrats , without any legislative authority have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at their personal whim for a disease with a 99.9 % survival rate .\nAustralia is an example of a country that has moved very firmly and decisively into police state territory .\nZoe Buhler , a 28-year-old pregnant mother was arrested , handcuffed and had her electronic devices confiscated for the crime of posting about an anti-lockdown protest on Facebook in a town with four active cases .\nThe name of the crime ?\n\u201c The planning and encouragement of protest activity.\n\u201d The punishment ?\nMrs. Buhler is looking at 15 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the video of Mrs. Buhler \u2019 s arrest here .\nIt should make your stomach turn .\nThe Premier of Victoria ( equivalent to the governor of this Australian state ) allowed and encouraged BLM protests of up to 10,000 that summer .\nIn Victoria , as elsewhere in Australia , as well as in many American states , people are not allowed to leave their houses except for reasons deemed \u201c essential \u201d by their government , then only for so long and between certain hours and you might need a hall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ going and why you are going there .\nAmong people harassed for the crime of sitting down on park benches include a law professor with cerebral palsy and her 70-year-old mother and a heavily pregnant woman while a young tradesman was harassed and fined for not having his papers filled out properly .\nWith new lockdowns rolling out that involve requirements to wear masks in your own home and a prohibition on all visitors , it is clear that some are attempting to bring back the bad old days of Spring 2020 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nThinking about protesting ?\nForget about being arrested and manhandled by police .\nIf your protests get too large , as they have done in Germany , the police will turn fire hoses on you like you \u2019 re in Alabama in 1956 .\nAnd then there \u2019 s the prospect of the vaccine , two versions of which will soon be available , if not mandatory .\nCould the coronavirus vaccine be \u201c the Mark of the Beast ?\n\u201d One doesn \u2019 t have to be religious to see it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ already boasting that no one will be able to work , travel or go to school without this vaccine that was rushed through approvals for political theater .\nFormer Vice President Joe Biden hasn \u2019 t ruled out making the vaccine mandatory , though the federal government will likely just punt enforcement to large corporations , similar to how they use Big Tech to manage information on the Internet and Big Finance to take banking services away from dissidents .\nBill Gates has called not only for mandatory vaccines , but also mandatory @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nIt \u2019 s worth noting that \u201c asymptomatic transmission , \u201d the notion that people who don \u2019 t know they \u2019 re sick are passing the disease around and thus , the entire basis of mask mandates and lockdowns , is patently false .\nAre our elites deliberately conspiring to instill fear or are they just idiotic dupes ?\nProbably a little from Column A and a little from Column B .\nBut one thing is clear \u2014 the economic , political , academic , and media elites in this country @ @ @ @ @ @ @ % survival rate to transform the country into a police state .\nPatriots and freedom lovers must resist this by any means necessary .\nOne way to do this is by patronizing local businesses who are openly defying mask mandates .\nBut in many cases you can circumvent these laws \u2014 particularly at big box stores \u2014 by saying : \u201c I have a health concern.\n\u201d The law prevents them from asking

purposes only and all opinions are the author \u2019 s alone .\nDo deeds get dirtier the deeper you go ?\nOn Friday , December 4th , Circuit Judge Kevin Elsenheimer ordered a forensic inspection of 22 Dominion election machines used in Antrim County and prohibited the destruction of evidence relating to the 2020 election .\nAccording to the Detroit Free Press , Antrim County spokesperson Jeremy Scott said forensic images will be taken @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Nov. 3 election .\nScott reportedly said a group called ASOG will begin taking the forensic images Sunday morning , with Clerk Sheryl Guy , county administrator Pete Garwood , and Bailey in attendance .\nThe imaging is expected to take hours , but there is no timeline for the forensic team \u2019 s investigation and results , he said .\nPlease follow Maryam Henein on Twitter @ maryamhenein you can support her work on https : //www.patreon.com/ maryamhenein The order , reports USANews , actually stemmed from voter William Bailey , who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a recounting of ballots in a village marijuana proposal that narrowly passed .\nThe Trump team used the opportunity to also gain access to the machines.\n\u201d \u201c Our team is going to be able to go in this morning at about 8:30 and will be there for about eight hours to conduct that forensic examination and we \u2019 ll have the results in about 48 hours , and that \u2019 ll tell us a lot about these machines , \u201d Trump election attorney Jenna Ellis told Fox News on Sunday , December @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a no brainer but apparently , according to John Basham , a retired AI Developer and former elected official , a memorandum , dated December 1st , Michigan election officials instructed all software & files associated with the election be deleted within seven days of canvassing .\nElsenheimer \u2019 s order comes after a back and forth decision by the Board of State Canvassers to certify Biden \u2019 s purported 154,000-vote victory in Michigan .\nReportedly , a record number of Michiganders \u2014 over 5.4 million \u2014participated in the electoral process this year @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Michigan one has to pay attention to detail \u2014 which is where the devil lies \u2014 as well as the surmounting testimony of odd yet similar experiences .\nWe start with the accounts of several vote dumps that first came in at approximately 4 am on Wednesday morning , showing that Joe Biden received almost 100 percent of the votes .\nStrange , given President Trump was leading by hundreds of thousands of votes as America went to sleep .\nMany states , including Michigan , reported that counting stopped for several @ @ @ @ @ @ @ theoretically can allow for an assessment of how many votes were \u201c needed.\n\u201d \u201c Imagine flipping a coin 4,645,908 times & getting heads 52 % of the time \u2014 then , at 3AM , you flip it 154,000 times & it \u2019 s 100 % tails \u2014 that \u2019 s Michigan , \u201d Lara Trump said on December 7 , via Twitter .\nIn Antrim , voting machines sparked controversy after a \u2018 software glitch \u2019 caused some 6,000 votes in one county to switch from Trump to Biden .\nWe didn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But later , Michigan officials claimed the glitch was not caused by Dominion machines or software , but related to a human error .\nHowever , Powell \u2019 s lawsuit filed on behalf of Republicans against Michigan Gov .\nGretchen Whitmer , Michigan Secretary of State Jocelyn Benson , and the Michigan Board of State Canvassers , affirms that the Dominion Voting Systems \u2019 election management system and voting machines ( tabulators ) were indeed used in Antrim County and that they were the reason for the bug .\nAntrim was just one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dominion Voting Systems to process their ballots .\nCan examiners verify for certain that the system was safe from fraudulent or unauthorized manipulation ?\nWas it really or glitch or is it a feature ?\nThe Powell lawsuit further states that the State of Michigan entered into a contract with Dominion Systems \u2019 Democracy Suite 4.14-D first , and then included Dominion Systems \u2019 Democracy Suite 5.0-S on or about January 27 , 2017 , which added a fundamental modification : \u201c dial-up and wireless results transmission capabilities to the ImageCast Precinct and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Results Transfer Manager module.\n\u201d \u201c While the glitch issue was identified and corrected after observers flagged the unlikeliness of the outcome , it \u2019 s unclear whether this issue replicated itself elsewhere , \u201d writes an open petition for an independent audit .\nDuring the Michigan senate hearing and via affidavit , Dominion contractor Melissa Carone , who worked at the TCF Center , said she witnessed countless workers rescanning batches without discarding them first \u2013 as required under Michigan rules and Dominion \u2019 s procedures \u2013 \u201c which resulted in ballots @ @ @ @ @ @ @ observed that a computer indicated that it had \u201c a number of over 400 ballots scanned \u2013 which means one batch [ of 50 ] was counted over eight times , \u201d and complained to her Dominion supervisor , she was informed that \u201c we are here to assist with IT work , not to run their election.\n\u201d \u201c The Dominion System put in place by its own design violates the intent of Federal law on the requirement to preserve and retain records \u2013 which clearly requires preservation of all records requisite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dominion logs are only voluntary , with no system-wide preservation system .\nWithout an incorruptible audit log , there is no acceptable system , \u201d states the Powell lawsuit .\nDominion denies this and contends that their systems \u201c are capable of producing paper records and are 100 % auditable , with testing , reviews , audits , and recounts subject to oversight and verification by all political parties.\n\u201d As evidence of the risks of the Dominion Democracy Suite , as described above , the same Dominion Democracy Suite was denied certification @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on January 24 , 2020 , specifically to be safe from fraud or unauthorized manipulation .\nMeanwhile in Detroit , an experienced ballot counter explained what she saw \u201c has never happened in the 20 years of being in this business.\n\u201d At the end of the day , when voting had stopped and they were ready to go home , suddenly a white van , a Chrysler , and a Ferrari pulled up with an estimated 130,000 additional ballots .\nDetroit poll watcher Shane Trejo also witnessed 61 cases of mystery ballots @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a city elections van in Detroit at 3:30am Election Night .\n\u201c No chain of custody , 7 1/2 hours of ballots in limbo\u2026public will be shocked at the fraud.\n\u201d \u201c This type of widespread fraud in the counting and processing of voter ballots can not be allowed to stand , \u201d said David A. Kallman , an attorney with the Great Lakes Justice Center , a non-profit corporation dealing with constitutional liberties and other civil rights issues , who filed an election crimes lawsuit in Wayne County Circuit Court in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ states that the criminal acts \u201c disenfranchised lawful voters and potentially changed the outcome of the election.\n\u201d \u201c Michigan citizens are entitled to know that their elections are conducted in a fair and legal manner and that every legal vote is properly counted.\n\u201d Following the elections , variations of irregularities soon surfaced , best detailed in a November 14th letter by Aric Nesbitt and other MI senators to Secretary of State Benson .\nNesbitt had requested an audit prior to the certification .\nAs Sidney Powell summarizes in her lawsuit , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ means , but the most fundamentally troubling , insidious , and egregious is the systemic adaptation of old-fashioned \u2018 Ballot-stuffing.\n\u2019 \u201d Some of the allegations in Nesbitt \u2019 s letter include : \u2022 counting the same batches of ballots multiple times ; \u2022 using false information to process ballots , such as using incorrect or false birthdays and inserting new names into the QVF and recorded these new voters as having a birthdate of 1/1/1900 ; \u2022 accepting ballots deposited in drop boxes after the deadline ; \u2022 counting ballots even though @ @ @ @ @ @ @ appear in the official voter rolls ; \u2022 ordering election workers to not verify voters \u2019 signatures on absentee ballots Some of these occurrences above are addressed in a lawsuit by The Amistad Project .\nOne of their suits is also faulting MI Secretary of State Jocelyn Benson for providing Rock The Vote , a far-left activist group that identifies as \u201c non-partisan , \u201d with the private information of MI residents .\n\u201c We also have two other pre-election lawsuits still pending .\nDespite inaccurate reports from other media , those have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the first and now we \u2019 re the last ones standing in the arena in Michigan , \u201d explains Attorney Ian Northon , Special Counsel for The Amistad Project .\nThere are also disturbing claims regarding how Michigan officials managed events prior to the 2020 election .\nFor instance , in September , the Detroit City Council approved a $ 1 million contract for the staffing firm P.I.E .\nManagement to hire up to 2,000 workers to work the polls and staff the ballot-counting machines at the TCF Center .\nThe lawsuit claims @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mark Zuckerberg through the group CTCL , \u201c which paid over $ 400 million nationwide to Democrat-favoring election officials and municipalities.\n\u201d The suit , which lists Karamo as a plaintiff ( mentioned earlier ) , also accuses Benson of sending at least 350,000 unsolicited ballots without a signed requested as required by Michigan law , and millions more absentee ballot applications without verifying whether the intended recipients were still residing at the same location , whether they were eligible to vote in 2020 , or even whether they were still alive .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ ballots cast by individuals who were registered to vote in another state .\nThey also counted 317 ballots from people who voted more than once and 259 ballots from voters who listed only an email address instead of a physical address .\nFinally , election officials mailed out at least 74,000 absentee ballots that voters requested online .\nThe above image , which highlights 500,000+ unlawful ballots or illegal votes , is the main case pending before the Michigan Supreme Court .\nAfter analyzing the data , experts observed more concrete patterns : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ramsland , Jr. noted a \u201c physically impossible \u201d event after analyzing voting machines in Michigan .\nHe determined that the maximum processing capability was only 94,867 ballots , so that \u201c there were 289,866 more ballots processed in the time available for processing in the four precincts/townships than the capacity allows.\n\u201d \u2022 Ramsland also identified \u201c 4 spikes totaling 384,733 ballots allegedly processed in a combined interval of 2 hours and 38 minutes \u201d for four precincts/townships in four Michigan counties ( Wayne , Oakland , Macomb and Kent ) .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ capable of processing 94,867 ballots in that time .\nYet , the reported results claimed that 384,733 ballots were processed .\nPhysically impossible.The spikes are strongly indicative of manual adjustment either by the operator of the system or an attack by outside actors .\n\u2022 An affidavit from Eric Quinell , Ph.D. analyzed the extraordinary increase in turnout from 2016 to 2020 in a relatively small subset of townships and precincts outside of Detroit in Wayne County and Oakland County , and more importantly , how nearly 100 % or more of all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 2020 voted for Biden .\nWayne County is Michigan \u2019 s largest metropolis and home to the city of Detroit .\n\u2022 Evidence compiled by Braynard using the National Change of Address \u2022 ( \u201c NCOA \u201d ) database shows that 12,120 Michigan voters in the 2020 General Election moved out-of-state prior to voting and therefore were ineligible .\nMr. Braynerd identified 1,170 Michigan voters in the 2020 General Election who subsequently registered to vote in another state , and were therefore ineligible to vote in the 2020 General Election .\nWhen duplicates @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the merged number is 13,248 ineligible voters whose votes must be removed from the total for the 2020 General Election .\nSee Voter Integrity Project : Findings and Conclusions .\n\u2022 Another separate nonpartisan effort by unpaid citizens and experts revealed hundreds of thousands of mail-in ballots flagged as potentially fraudulent , leading statisticians to posit \u201c strong evidence \u201d exists that results were \u201c manipulated by a computer algorithm.\n\u201d Of the 3,507,129 ballots requested , the report flags hundreds of thousands of ballots with qualities such as \u201c duplicate ballot IDs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u201d or

Earle Yet another side effect of the government \u2019 s response to Covid-19 is shining through in recent business headlines .\nIn a widely-touted deal last week , Salesforce acquired Slack for over $ 27 billion .\nThe purchase is one of the largest ever in the software industry and is the largest cloud software deal ever .\nWhile the Salesforce acquisition is one of the highest-profile deals in recent memory , it is only one of the latest in a long chain of consolidations that have occurred during the pandemic .\nSince the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mergers , acquisitions , and restructurings has been accelerating .\nFirms normally take such actions when they see an opportunity to increase profits\u2013\u2013for example , via economies of scale or increased productivity\u2013\u2013or when the buy versus build proposition for a sought-after brand or product shifts .\nThat being said , the recent wave of activity is almost entirely the result of the first and second order effects of government policies .\nThere are three elements to this accelerated activity : the financial environment , lockdown effects , and varied commercial exposures .\nThough @ @ @ @ @ @ @ always shape the pace and focus of corporate activity , the pandemic-era burst is driven by the asymmetric effects lockdowns have upon small firms and consumers\u2013\u2013and comes at their expense .\nInterest rates have been in historically low ranges for most of the last two decades , but with the stresses in the U.S. Treasury market ( which soon spread to other markets , in later phases seeing a withdrawal of liquidity from both the commercial paper and revolving loan markets ) , the Fed tilted back to near-ZIRP mode .\nAfter lowering @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on Sunday , March 15 , the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System dropped the Fed Funds rate from a target range of 1 % to 1.25 % to a 0 % to 0.25 % rate .\nThis was not only the result of an emergency unscheduled meeting\u2013\u2013a sign of the level of exigence and panic\u2013\u2013but was also a 150 basis point reduction , six times the normal rate-shifting increment .\nThe rate at the discount window was slashed from 2.75 % to 0.25 % , with the term length of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ days .\nAfter the stock market crash on March 16 , 2020 , and owing both to a tidal wave of liquidity and the realization that apocalyptic predictions never came to pass , an astronomical rise in U.S. equity markets began : Between March 16 , 2020 , and November 2 , 2020 , the S & P 500 rose 67.80 % , the Dow Jones Industrial Average 57.66 % , and NASDAQ a whopping 107.56 % .\nWith interest rates at Great Recession-era lows and equity prices rising at rates comparable to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gave rise to an acquisitive frenzy .\nLarge firms , both publicly-traded and private , seized upon opportunities to acquire particularly hard-hit companies in vulnerable sectors , spurred by the availability of loans at virtually 0 percent financing and/or pumped up stock values for equity-financed deals .\nJust last week , for instance , Retail Ecommerce Ventures announced that it would buy Stein Mart for $ 6.02 million , with plans to relaunch the company online next year .\nStein Mart filed for bankruptcy in August due to what CEO Hunt Hawkins called @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u201c significant financial distress \u201d brought on by the Covid-19 pandemic .\nAfter 112 years of operation , the company could not weather this storm .\nAccording to Thomas Vaughn , co-leader of Dykema \u2019 s Mergers & Acquisitions practice , \u201c \u2026deal-makers see increasing opportunities for completing deals in the next 12 months \u201d despite ongoing economic uncertainty .\nThere are consolidation options open to many different types of actors , says Vaughn , \u201c whether you \u2019 re a strategic or financial-focused buyer or a seller hoping to cash out.\n\u201d @ @ @ @ @ @ @ closely tracked the business cycle ; small businesses are , for obvious reasons , usually hit harder than their larger competitors .\nNot only are smaller firms thinly-capitalized and run on a shoestring budget , they are starkly undiversified as one-off establishments .\nThe Covid-19 lockdowns , in part owing to their sudden imposition and in part due to their unique nature ( namely , their not being driven by the liquidation of malinvestment ) , have been particularly devastating to small and micro-firms .\nWith the election threatening the introduction of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ President-elect Joe Biden has commented that he would back a federal mask mandate\u2013\u2013there was a rush to get deals consummated .\nIn the seven days prior to November 3rd , The price exacted by lockdowns is still being tallied , but the American Institute for Economic Research has been keeping a record of those costs over time .\nYet these , ruinous as they are , are only one factor..\nThe Covid-19-era economy has put once-secure companies at risk as government restrictions and changing consumer habits exact their damage .\nIn such economically @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heavy-hitters alike see mergers and acquisitions as an effective way to develop their presence in the business world .\nGovernment reactions to the pandemic have been strong driving influences , particularly those centered on lockdowns .\nIn some instances , as in the cases of Hertz , Brooks Brothers , Frontier Communications , Gold \u2019 s Gym , Ruby Tuesday , and Vision Group , firms that were formerly viable have become distressed owing to the effects of lockdowns or market reactions to lockdowns .\nThat being said , firms in certain sectors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ economy .\nHealthcare was an active field for corporate actions .\nAlready a fragmented industry , pharmaceuticals saw some major mergers surrounding vaccine development efforts and the transforming medical landscape .\nMany companies have taken to selling off businesses to build their cash positions , creating speculation that some firms are gearing up to pursue acquisitions .\nAmong them are giants like Pfizer and Sanofi .\nDrugmakers , emboldened by higher stock prices and considering the promise of the next Operation Warp Speed , have been snapping up competitors and complementary firms .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ regimens are good business : The oil exploration and drilling sectors were busy in the wake of the brief eruption of a free market in oil .\nIn early March of 2020 , Saudi Arabia and Russia engaged in a price war , effectively leading to a tidal wave of oil hitting the market at a time when Covid-19 lockdowns had driven demand for oil and petroleum products to its lowest level in generations ( perhaps ever , indeed , in the modern world ) with uncertain , varying reopening guidelines worldwide .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ production firms having filed for protection from creditors and vulture firms circling , a rapid decrease in the number of such firms is likely in the near- to medium-term .\nUnsurprisingly , sectors that support today \u2019 s remote economy have seen some of the most drastic increases in mergers and acquisitions .\nTechnology media and telecom saw the most deals of any sector in the third quarter , with 760 deals totaling $ 301.2 billion .\nThese , too , owe almost entirely to the stay-at-home orders issued by governors and municipal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , entertainment , and retail businesses have been hit hard by the restrictions , particularly in major cities , the impact on firms is \u201c certainly not sector specific.\n\u201d Not only are firms with razor-thin margins and meager savings being ordered to close with little notice , but the consumption volumes and patterns of patrons have been severely altered as well .\nU.S. Census Bureau data from the first half of 2020 verifies this : Between March and July 2020 , 50 percent of consumers reported a loss of income ; and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ percent of small businesses reported revenue declines .\nConsolidation at the \u201c top \u201d has been accompanied by a depression-tenor winnowing at the bottom .\nThis economic \u201c extinction-level event \u201d took root due to less competition and greater concentration .\nThis article is not a harangue against corporate size , the effects of consolidation , or the periodically tremendous rewards that accrue to investment banking , private equity , or vulture investment activity .\nNor does it seek to criticize rapid and unpredictable changes of taste for their effects upon firms .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ with distortions caused by government tinkering in financial markets and unintended ( however easily anticipatable ) consequences of social policies .\nThe purchase of Slack by Salesforce may well have happened absent lockdowns , office closures , and waves of fear sent coursing through the economy .\nAnd in addition to what has been seen thus far , dealmakers project increasing opportunities in the coming year or two .\nMeanwhile , the impact of the restrictions has devastated small firms , the engine of employment within the U.S. economy .\nIt has also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which both first-time and prospective entrepreneurs will face : The next time a nasty virus appears in the United States\u2013\u2013or any pathogen , really , that is perceived to be dangerous\u2013\u2013there is a nonzero possibility that their entire livelihood and their life \u2019 s work will be swept away with the proverbial stroke of a pen .\nIt \u2019 s a stupefying state of affairs : For decades , anti-wealth activists , disingenuous social scientists , and political agitators have been asserting that the gap between the rich and poor has been increasing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) , ignoring two distinguishing features of the wealth gap in the United States and most advanced industrial economies .\nNot only is it not nearly as wide as alleged , but there is rapid turnover at the \u201c top , \u201d and a rising tide for all income levels .\nIn actuality , lockdown policies have deftly accomplished what the enemies of the market have long alleged capitalism and free markets do .\nNot only have the anti-Covid policies artificially expedited the consolidation of firms and the harvesting of market share lost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gap has increased .\nBlue collar and administrative workers generally have fewer options for working at home than higher-paid , white collar and professional workers do .\nNever before , even during periods where \u201c corporate greed \u201d or \u201c predatory practices \u201d have supposedly been out of control , has there been such a complete reversal of decades of economic progress made by lower income groups in such a short amount of time .\nNonpharmaceutical interventions\u2013\u2013mostly lockdowns , which are structurally ( if unintentionally ) biased in favor of large businesses\u2013\u2013alongside a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ policy initiatives have , in a way that no conniving billionaire ever could have engineered , thrust the rich and firms with existing economic heft upward while crushing the poor , struggling workers , and minorities .\nAnd with greater market power , barriers to entry will likely creep higher , making it more difficult for smaller or upstart firms to enter certain industries than prior to the policy-induced agglomeration of firms .\nAlthough it will be some time before the precise macroeconomic and social effects can be analyzed , the post-lockdown trend @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in 2020 as a Research Intern .\nShe is currently an associate contributor for Young Voices .\nHer writing has been featured in the Wall Street Journal , the Orange County Register , and various other national and local outlets .\nPrior to joining AIER , she worked for the Foundation for Economic Education .\nPeter C.

mentioned in earlier pieces , the coronavirus was used as an excuse to redefine electoral laws .\n\u201c My concerns began prior to the election over the increased effort to solicit voters during the Covid-19 pandemic who may not be legally able to vote , \u201d explains Brenda Savage of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a bipartisan nonprofit organization dedicated to assuring that elections are conducted legally .\nShe witnessed a push to offer mail-in ballots to all residents of voting age compared to the previous method of sending Absentee Ballot requests only to registered voters within municipalities by their Clerks .\nSavage became a plaintiff in a suit filed by Thomas More Law Society through The Amistad Project due to the changes put forth by the Oakland County Clerk reducing the ability of registered voters to participate as Poll Challengers .\nThe lawsuit named Jocelyn Benson as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Government .\nIntimidation was a theme in Michigan .\nAside from alleged ballot fraud , there were also accounts of poll challenge barriers .\nAccounts detail that election officials systematically discriminated against Republican poll watchers and in favor of Democratic poll watchers and activists in enforcing rules \u2014 in particular , through abuse of \u201c social distancing \u201d requirements .\nSavage can attest as she fielded dozens of affidavits via EIF .\nMeanwhile , the lawsuit filed by Trump against Michigan Secretary of State Jocelyn Benson and Wayne County officials was accompanied by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ election challengers were allegedly blocked from having a sufficient view of the vote-counting process and that challenges against certain ballots were ignored .\nAs a result , ineligible ballots were tallied .\nChallenger Mary Shinkle , for instance , was told by an election worker that she was not allowed to observe a ballot duplication because \u201c if [ democrats ] make a mistake then [ republicans ] would be all over us.\n\u201d Meanwhile , Jessy Jacob says she observed City of Detroit election workers and employees coaching and trying to coach @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Democrat party and improperly pre-date the absentee ballot .\n\u201c I witnessed these workers and employees encouraging voters to do a straight Democrat ballot , \u201d she said at a Michigan state legislature hearing .\nLater , Savage recounted how Jacob sought out her team members for support .\n\u201c She came to us for protection as we are unbiased.\n\u201d Incidentally , a Michigan Secretary of State official told The Epoch Times during the hearing , that \u201c no actual evidence of any wrongdoing or fraud was presented , despite repeated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Democrat election officials also reportedly would applaud , cheer , and yell whenever a Republican challenger was ejected from the counting area .\nThe Trump lawsuit also mentioned the backdating of ballots and unverified voters .\nFor instance , Kayleigh Mcenany , a Wayne County election worker , stated in a sworn affidavit that she was instructed to falsify THOUSANDS of absentee ballots in Detroit .\nTrump \u2019 s campaign withdrew their lawsuit on Nov. 19 .\nHere \u2019 s a piece titled How Dead Voters Can Vote in Michigan .\nWatch this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she was discriminated against .\nIn response to Trump \u2019 s lawsuit and allegations of election chicanery , Jake Rollow , Michigan Department of State spokesperson , said : To Certify Or Not To Certify The Michigan certification process was also rife with threats , intimidation , and drama .\nOn Friday , November 20th , amid the certification hoopla , President Donald Trump summoned Michigan \u2019 s Republican legislative leaders Senate Majority Leader Mike Shirkey and House Speaker Lee Chatfield to the White House .\nThe mainstream cast rumors on what they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in large part , COVID-19 relief .\nOn Saturday , November 21st , Republican National Committee Chair Ronna McDaniel and Michigan Republican Chair Laura Cox sent a letter to Michigan \u2019 s Board of State Canvassers to urge a delay in the certification .\n\u201c To simply gloss over these irregularities now without a thorough audit would only foster feelings of distrust among Michigan \u2019 s electorate , \u201d the letter reads .\nYet on Monday , November 23rd , 11/23/2020 , following an over three-hour virtual meeting broadcast live by Michigan Board @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , 3-0 , to move forward with the certification of the election results , despite allegations that 71 % of poll votes seemingly did not match in Wayne County .\nAfter listening to the meeting for about an hour , my takeaway was that Democrats were shaming anyone who opposed certification , describing them as unpatriotic and suggesting that not certifying is a felony , which it \u2019 s not .\nThe Detroit News reported that Republican board member Aaron Van Langevelde crossed over to join the two Democratic board members in supporting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ board , Norm Shinkle , a Republican , abstained .\nYou can read Facebook Whistleblower Ryan Hartwig \u2019 s notes for more from that meeting .\nThat same day , an order to enjoin the certification with the Michigan Supreme Court against the City of Detroit and Michigan Democratic party was denied .\nThe two plaintiffs , Cheryl Costantino and Edward McCall , contended that \u201c the results of the November 2020 election [ are ] certified .\n.\n.\nPlaintiffs will lose their right to audit its results , thereby losing the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Indeed , the plain language of Const 1963 , art 2 , \u00a7 4 ( 1 ) ( h ) does not require an audit to precede the certification of election results .\nLogically , you may assume that you need to audit before certification , but it seems it \u2019 s the opposite .\n\u201c To the contrary , certified results would seem to be a prerequisite for such an audit\u2026 \u201d \u201c You can think of it this way until it \u2019 s certified , it remains theoretical , \u201d explains @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Chairman of the Federal Election Commission ( FEC ) .\nInitially , Wayne County GOP members deadlocked with a 2-2 vote on the decision to certify election votes , and the two Republicans only agreed to move forward if they received a \u201c comprehensive audit.\n\u201d In an affidavit , Republicans Monica Palmer and William C. Hartmann said they later learned that state officials would not honor the audit to verify whether voter registration and votes cast balances out .\nThey felt they had no recourse but to oppose certification until more investigation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tactics , e.g .\nbeing accused of being racist , as the reason for agreeing to finally certify the day prior .\nThe two tried to get the certification rescinded without luck .\nMichigan officials went on the record to state the Board of Canvassers , who wanted to reverse their decision , were out of luck .\nMichigan \u2019 s chief election officer said a post-election audit will be performed , though not to check \u201c mythical allegations \u201d of fraud .\n\u201c There is no legal mechanism for them to rescind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and the next step in the process is for the Board of State Canvassers to meet and certify , \u201d Tracy Wimmer , a spokeswoman for the Michigan secretary of state , reported to AP News .\nSecretary of State Jocelyn Benson stated that trying to halt the certification process was \u201c nothing more than an attempt to misuse these roles to play partisan politics and cause confusion which , again , is kind of the norm that we \u2019 ve seen throughout this election.\n\u201d According to The Detroit News , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had taken place , they would be implementing a statewide risk-limiting audit and local procedural audits to affirm the integrity of the process and identify opportunities for improvement to strengthen elections \u201c even further in the months ahead.\n\u201d Note that there are different types of audits .\nFor instance , routine post-election audits check voting system performance in contests , regardless of how close margins of victory appear .\nFor these process-based audits , it would not appear critical whether they occur before the election results are finally certified , as the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that could be used to perfect voting systems going forward .\nWhat have those audits looked like in the past ?\nHow will they look this time around ?\nGood to note : a review of election laws conducted in early 2018 similarly recommended that audits be undertaken \u201c after preliminary outcomes are announced , but before official certification of election results.\n\u201d Because this allows for \u201c correction of preliminary results if preliminary election outcomes are found to be incorrect.\n\u201d Purposefully confusing ?\nMichigan \u2019 s audit manual says audits should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ board certification of results , or by Dec. 23 .\nThe Powell lawsuits assert that when it comes to Michigan , the results for the President in the November 3 , 2020 election must be set aside .\nArguably , Governor Whitmer , Secretary Benson , and other defendants violated the Equal Protection Clause of the 14th Amendment , which prohibits states from denying any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the law .\nIn other words , the laws of a state must treat an individual in the same manner @ @ @ @ @ @ @ circumstances .\nA violations of the Michigan Election Code is considered a felony .\n\u201c You must know in your heart that

currently taxed at a top \u201c collectibles \u201d rate of 28 % .\nEven if a Republican-controlled Senate thwarts Biden \u2019 s most ambitious tax hiking plans , his Treasury Secretary will be able to implement taxpayer-adverse regulatory changes and direct more funding to the Internal Revenue Service for enforcement actions .\nYellen can be expected to push for more IRS audits of taxpayers and

distribution rules .\nThe IRS does impose certain restrictions on size and purity , but a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and bars are eligible .\nIn addition to gold and silver , you can even hold physical platinum and palladium within an IRA .\nTo get started in funding a Self-Directed Precious Metals IRA , choose a reputable account trustee then arrange for a bullion dealer such as Money Metals Exchange to

unwarranted government surveillance .\nThis past week , the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs committee took aim at unresolved investigations .\nChairman Ron Johnson , a Republican ,

Comply?", "date": "2020-12-10", "source": "activistpost", "title": "One of the First Executive Orders Biden Will Pass is Gun Control \u2014 Will You Comply?", "content": "On Tuesday , Stef Feldman , the national policy director of Joe Biden \u2019 s presidential campaign , announced in a meeting put on by the Georgetown Institute of Politics and Public Service , that gun control is at the top of Biden \u2019 s list .\nThere will be no vote or democratic process , and like Trump and Obama before him , Biden will use Executive Orders to implement his will .\nFeldman pointed out that when he gets in the White House , Biden is planning to \u201c make big , bold changes through executive action , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we talked about previously , but in healthcare and education , on gun violence , on a range of issues , \u201d adding , \u201c there \u2019 s really a lot you can do through guidance and executive action.\n\u201d This statement should come as no surprise as Biden has been an outspoken gun grabber , and on his campaign website he \u2019 s stated that he will use executive action to enforce gun control .\nOn the site , Biden states that he will use executive action to \u201c get weapons of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ AR-style weapon a \u201c weapon of war \u201d is laughable given the fact that Biden , under president Obama , aided in the wholesale slaughter of countless innocent civilians in Afghanistan , Iraq , Yemen , Libya , and Somalia \u2014 using actual \u201c weapons of war \u201d like drone strikes , hellfire missiles , and sanctions .\nNevertheless , the new boss \u2014 who is the same as the old boss , contrary to what many believe \u2014 plans to immediately ban the \u201c manufacture and sale of assault weapons and high-capacity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all legal gun owners to register their firearms with the state , or be forced to turn them in , going so far as to issued an ultimatum .\nBiden also plans on instituting legislation that will limit how many guns you can purchase .\nOn top of that , he plans on telling you how you can purchase them by banning the \u201c sale of firearms , ammunition , kits , and gun parts online.\n\u201d Perhaps one of Biden \u2019 s most ominous moves in regard to controlling guns is his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that will require biometrics to fire in an ostensible move to \u201c prevent unauthorized use.\n\u201d In reality , however , this paves the way for bad actors , including the state and hackers , to be able to control , hack , or essentially turn off your gun , making it a paperweight .\nBiden also plans to pick up where Trump left off in regard to extreme risk laws , also called \u201c red flag \u201d laws .\nUnder Biden \u2019 s plan , which is similar to the many plans @ @ @ @ @ @ @ law enforcement officials will be able to make claims \u2014 many which involve no evidence \u2014 allowing a person \u2019 s guns to be temporarily taken until that person is declared fit enough to get them back .\nBut would grabbing guns from people deemed a risk by the state actually have any effect on mass violence ?\nNot likely , nor would the stronger background checks that Biden is also pushing for .\nStronger background checks would have little to no effect on mass shootings as most of the mass shooters acquire @ @ @ @ @ @ @ checks .\nAs Reason points out : Citizens who are targeted by these laws will be deemed guilty first and only after their guns are taken , will they have a chance to defend themselves in court .\nThis is the de facto removal of due process .\nAs Reuters reports , under the legislation , a family member or law enforcement officer could petition a judge to seize firearms from a person they think is a threat to themselves or others .\nThe judge could then hold a hearing without the targeted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ order for 14 days .\nUnder the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments , due process clauses are in place to act as a safeguard from arbitrary denial of life , liberty , or property by the government outside the sanction of law .\nIn spite of what officials and the media claim , when a person is stripped of their constitutional rights , albeit temporarily , without being given the chance to make their own case based on what can be entirely arbitrary accusations , this is the removal of due process .\nAnd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it doesn \u2019 t work .\nWe \u2019 ve seen this play out before already .\nLast year , a tragedy unfolded in California as a deranged gunman , Kevin Douglas Limbaugh , walked up on an innocent woman , officer Natalie Corona , pulled out his guns and began shooting her repeatedly until she died .\nLimbaugh then fired several more shots at others before turning the gun on himself and taking his own life .\nHad more people been nearby , Limbaugh would \u2019 ve likely carried out a mass shooting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to bring up due to the fact that \u2014 before he killed a cop \u2014 he was subject to California \u2019 s \u201c red flag \u201d laws in 2018 .\nLimbaugh was given a high-risk assessment that ordered him to turn in his registered weapons to police , the only one being a Bushmaster AR-15 .\nOn November 9 , Limbaugh turned in the weapon .\nDespite being banned from possessing a weapon , he still obtained one illegally and used it to commit murder .\nLaws do not stop those willing to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , there were already laws on the books that should \u2019 ve stopped Nikolas Cruz , the murdering psychopath in Parkland , FL , from ever getting a gun as well .\nBut none of them worked .\nCiting Cruz as the reason for advocating the erosion of the 2nd Amendment , the anti-gun activists are claiming he should \u2019 ve had his guns taken which would have prevented the tragedy .\nSadly , however , they are ignoring the fact that he was accused of multiple felonies by multiple people\u2014and should \u2019 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gun in the first place\u2014but law enforcement failed to act on any of it .\nThese threats included specifically saying he was going to carry out a mass shooting and threatening to kill individual people .\nThe reactionary nature of disarming law-abiding Americans because deranged psychopaths kill people is dangerous and only serves to keep the guns out of the hands of law-abiding citizens as the above two cases illustrate .\nMoreover , as Biden attacks , guns , he is forgetting that deranged psychopaths don \u2019 t even need guns to cause @ @ @ @ @ @ @ study , even if all guns were removed from America , in a ten-year period 355 people still would \u2019 ve been murdered in mass killings .\nFrom 2006 to 2015 , 140 people were murdered by arsonists in mass fires , 104 were stabbed in mass stabbings , and 92 people were beaten to death in mass killings .\nTo reiterate , these are deaths in which four or more people were killed .\n\u201c People sufficiently enraged to commit such crimes may also be motivated to find other ways , \u201d @ @ @ @ @ @ @ points out .\nDespite all this information to the contrary , the left led by Biden and the right led by Trump seem hell bent on further eroding the rights of the 99.9999999 percent of the innocent people who are not murderous psychopaths .\nAnd all of it will be and has been \u201c legal \u201d \u2014 due process and innocence be damned .\nMatt Agorist is an honorably discharged veteran of the USMC and former intelligence operator directly tasked by the NSA .\nThis prior experience gives him unique insight into the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ police state .\nAgorist has been an independent journalist for over a

.\nHowever , some constitutional experts say the deadline does not apply to disputed states , and that more time is needed to properly investigate ballot irregularities and voting anomalies .\n\u201c The ONLY Electoral College deadline specifically required by the Constitution @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which point Trump \u2019 s first term officially ends , \u201d Phillip Kline of The Amistad Project tweeted Tuesday .\nAccording to a press release from The Amistad Project , \u201c the December 8 \u2018 safe harbor \u2019 deadline for appointing presidential Electors does not apply to states where flagrant violations of state election laws affected the outcome of the popular vote .\nIn fact , the only Constitutionally-set date in the election process is the assumption of office by the President on January 20.\n\u201d Please follow Maryam Henein on Twitter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ https : //www.patreon.com/ maryamhenein The Amistad Project has filed litigation in several key swing states arguing that illegal conduct by state and local officials led to more than 1.2 million potentially fraudulent ballots , including illegal votes that were counted and legal votes that were not counted .\nIn each state , the number of potentially fraudulent ballots far exceeds the margin separating the leading presidential candidate .\nMeanwhile , Michigan is still waiting on the report from a forensic audit of Dominion voting machines in Antrim County mentioned in a previous piece @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , who filed a lawsuit on Friday on behalf of Central Lake resident William Bailey , claims that Dominion Voting Systems \u201c committed material fraud or error in this election so that the outcome of the election was affected.\n\u201d DePerno was granted permission to conduct a forensic study of the 16 Dominion voting machines , tabulators , thumb drives , related software , and the Clerk \u2019 s \u201c master tabulator.\n\u201d \u201c My forensic team is still reviewing the information , and we

fraud \u2014 with the Trump administration or anyone else .\nMeanwhile , State Rep. Matt Hall , the Republican who chairs the Michigan House Oversight Committee sent a follow-up letter to Dominion CEO John Poulos asking , yet again , to help answer a few questions to help lawmakers and voters better understand the election software .\nHall even said he was amenable to Zoom but that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he was prepared to issue a legislative subpoena to \u2018 compel \u2019 an appearance .\nRead more in The Epoch Times .\nPoulos grew Dominion through direct support to elections in Mongolia and the Philippines .\nHe also co-founded The Delian Project , a non-governmental organization that \u201c aims to help post-conflict and emerging democracies implement positive change in their electoral process through the application of technology.\n\u201d Critics have linked The Delian Project and Democrats .\nIt turns out the Clinton Foundation invested $ 2.25 million in Dominion Voting .\nInterestingly , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Administration in January on the topic of election security perspectives .\nHe mentioned Dominion being a U.S.-owned company , although it \u2019 s headquartered in Toronto .\nFinally in a twist , Attorney General Ken Paxton filed a 92-page lawsuit in the US Supreme Court against Against Pennsylvania , Georgia , Michigan & Wisconsin .\nA major point of the lawsuit is going to hinge on the fact that local officials in these 4 states changed voting policies , including the expansion of mail-in ballots because of the COVID-19 pandemic , without the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , writes Sarah Westall , challenges the defendant \u2019 s administration of the

.\nPresident Trump says at least 17 States have joined Texas in the case against Election Fraud .\nAs mentioned in earlier pieces , the coronavirus was used as an excuse to redefine electoral laws

) , a bipartisan nonprofit organization dedicated to assuring that elections are conducted legally .\nShe witnessed a push to offer mail-in ballots to all residents of voting age compared to the previous method of sending Absentee Ballot requests only to registered voters within municipalities by their Clerks .\nSavage became a plaintiff in a suit filed by Thomas More Law Society through The Amistad Project due to the changes put forth by the Oakland County Clerk , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ participate as Poll Challengers .\nThe lawsuit named Jocelyn Benson as Secretary of State and the Oakland County Government .\nIntimidation was a theme in Michigan .\nAside from alleged ballot fraud , there were also accounts of poll challenge barriers .\nAccounts detail that election officials systematically discriminated against Republican poll watchers and in favor of Democratic poll watchers and activists in enforcing rules \u2014 in particular , through abuse of \u201c social distancing \u201d requirements .\nSavage can attest as she fielded dozens of affidavits via EIF .\nMeanwhile , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of State Jocelyn Benson and Wayne County officials was accompanied by 234 pages of sworn affidavits .\nCredentialed election challengers were allegedly blocked from having a sufficient view of the vote-counting process and that challenges against certain ballots were ignored .\nAs a result , ineligible ballots were tallied .\nChallenger Mary Shinkle , for instance , was told by an election worker that she was not allowed to observe a ballot duplication because \u201c if [ democrats ] make a mistake then [ republicans ] would be all over us.\n\u201d Meanwhile @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Detroit election workers and employees coaching and trying to coach voters to vote for Joe Biden and the Democrat party and improperly pre-date the absentee ballot .\n\u201c I witnessed these workers and employees encouraging voters to do a straight Democrat ballot , \u201d she said at a Michigan state legislature hearing .\nLater , Savage recounted how Jacob sought out her team members for support .\n\u201c She came to us for protection as we are unbiased.\n\u201d Incidentally , a Michigan Secretary of State official told The Epoch Times during @ @ @ @ @ @ @ evidence of any wrongdoing or fraud was presented , despite repeated questions requesting such evidence from lawmakers.\n\u201d Democrat election officials also reportedly would applaud , cheer , and yell whenever a Republican challenger was ejected from the counting area .\nThe Trump lawsuit also mentioned the backdating of ballots and unverified voters .\nFor instance , a Wayne County election worker stated in a sworn affidavit that she was instructed to falsify THOUSANDS of absentee ballots in Detroit .\nTrump \u2019 s campaign withdrew their lawsuit on Nov. 19 .\nHere \u2019 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Can Vote in Michigan .\nWatch this Trump poll watcher from Michigan who says she was discriminated against .\nIn response to Trump \u2019 s lawsuit and allegations of election chicanery , Jake Rollow , Michigan Department of State spokesperson , said : To Certify Or Not To Certify The Michigan certification process was also rife with threats , intimidation , and drama .\nOn Friday , November 20th , amid the certification hoopla , President Donald Trump summoned Michigan \u2019 s Republican legislative leaders Senate Majority Leader Mike Shirkey and House Speaker @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The mainstream cast rumors on what they would discuss .\nLater reports they discussed in large part , COVID-19 relief .\nOn Saturday , November 21st , Republican National Committee Chair Ronna McDaniel and Michigan Republican Chair Laura Cox sent a letter to Michigan \u2019 s Board of State Canvassers to urge a delay in the certification .\n\u201c To simply gloss over these irregularities now without a thorough audit would only foster feelings of distrust among Michigan \u2019 s electorate , \u201d the letter reads .\nYet on Monday , November 23rd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ virtual meeting broadcast live by Michigan Board of State Canvassers , it was decided , 3-0 , to move forward with the certification of the election results , despite allegations that 71 % of poll votes seemingly did not match in Wayne County .\nAfter listening to the meeting for about an hour , my takeaway was that Democrats were shaming anyone who opposed certification , describing them as unpatriotic and suggesting that not certifying is a felony , which it \u2019 s not .\nThe Detroit News reported that Republican board member @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the two Democratic board members in supporting certification .\nA fourth member of the board , Norm Shinkle , a Republican , abstained .\nYou can read Facebook Whistleblower Ryan Hartwig \u2019 s notes for more from that meeting .\nThat same day , an order to enjoin the certification with the Michigan Supreme Court against the City of Detroit and Michigan Democratic party was denied .\nThe two plaintiffs , Cheryl Costantino and Edward McCall , contended that \u201c the results of the November 2020 election [ are ] certified .\n.\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ audit its results , thereby losing the rights guaranteed under the Michigan Constitution.\n\u201d Indeed , the plain language of Const 1963 , art 2 , \u00a7 4 ( 1 ) ( h ) does not require an audit to precede the certification of election results .\nLogically , you may assume that you need to audit before certification , but it seems it \u2019 s the opposite .\n\u201c To the contrary , certified results would seem to be a prerequisite for such an audit\u2026 \u201d \u201c You can think of it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it remains theoretical , \u201d explains Trey Trainor , Commissioner , and current Chairman of the Federal

, Mario Savio stood on the steps of Sproul Hall at UC Berkeley and made a short speech , which has resonated through the decades : That speech , according to some pundits , marked the birth of the counterculture .\nWhat followed then\u2014the Free Speech Movement , the protests against the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Angela Davis and the Black Panthers , even the Symbionese Liberation Party\u2013all began in California .\nBerkeley today is quiet .\nDead , almost .\nThe soap boxers of the \u2019 60s , the shirtless young men throwing frisbees in Sproul Plaza on a Spring Day , the leafletters , all seem to

mainstream mandates about Covid .\nCalifornia @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a history as a trendsetter and as a hotbed of innovation .\nHowever , the California of today bears little resemblance to the maverick of

was born in California .\nI attended UC Berkeley as well , years after Mario Savio but during years of protest and civil disobedience .\nAnd the generalizations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and compliant certainly do not apply to everyone in California .\nHowever , the general impression is that California is deeply committed to the \u201c official narrative.\n\u201d Back when I was growing up , the Democratic Party was considered to be the party of the people .\nGrowing up in a Democratic household , we looked askance and with suspicion at the Republican party , considering it to be the Money Party and the party of warmongers , corporate CEOs and hawks .\nBut as protest movements become folded into established policies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more and more mainstream and less and less like a clear alternative to the monied guys across the aisle .\nToday , the only stark difference between the two parties is that one proposes totalitarian government rule and the other advances a corporatocracy .\nAnd

the well being of those living under the system .\nBecome an Activist Post Patron for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ California was one of the first states to pass an Assisted Suicide law , which many view as a thin cover for a eugenics agenda .\nThe atrocities of California \u2019 s guardianship system produced one of the first ( faux ) expos\u00e9s of its probate courts , prompting the California legislature to pass a package of new laws , which parenthetically have made no difference whatsoever .\nSssh !\nApparently the venerable LA Times hasn \u2019 t figured this out yet .\nIt was the Times \u2019 series back in 2005 When @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which prompted the legislative action .\nSpecifically , the new laws called for the creation of a \u201c Professional Fiduciaries Bureau , \u201d ostensibly to oversee

information that the new laws were worthless by saying , \u201c We aren \u2019 t covering this any more.\n\u201d One explanation for the change in California \u2014 and Californians \u2014 is that they may have been chemically lobotomized .\nCalifornia has extensively fluoridated most of its water systems , from San Diego to Sonoma .\nFluoride is known to cause docility in those who imbibe it

heterosexual bonding behavior .\nAccording to this agent , the result was the mass \u201c gayification \u201d of San Francisco .\nWere other behavior modification experiments run on Californians

Matt Hall .\nThe previous day Republican electors in Michigan were blocked from entering the Capitol Building in Lansing to cast ballots opposing Democrat Joe Biden for president , a move that was supported by the GOP speaker of the House .\nPoulos \u2019 appearance comes on the heels of a scathing forensics audit report that concluded Dominion was intentionally and purposefully designed with inherent errors to create systemic fraud and influence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because of a supposed \u201c glitch \u201d in Antrim County where 6,000 votes were switched from Trump to Biden .\nForty-seven other counties also used the same Dominion Voting Systems .\nYou can read more on Antrim County and Dominion in previous Activist Post articles .\nBased on their findings , the team from Allied Security Operations Group suggested that the Dominion Voting System should not be used in Michigan .\nThey also suggested that the results of Antrim County should not have been certified .\nThey examined compact flash cards used by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , USB memory sticks used by Dominion Voter Assist Terminals , and USB memory sticks used for the poll book , and performed forensic duplication on the county \u2019 s election management server , which was running Dominion Democracy Suite 5.5.3-002 .\nIncidentally , Michigan Secretary of State Jocelyn Benson intervened to prevent the audit results from being released .\nThis prompted attorney Matthew DePerno , working on behalf of Plaintiff William Bailey , to file an emergency motion , requesting the judge unseal the results .\n\u201c Let me start by saying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be credible , by a judge or election official , I am not aware of it , \u201d Poulos responded when Senator Michael MacDonald asked him whether it was possible for anything to have been manipulated .\nIn fact , he denied without exception all allegations related to machines and software used in elections .\nHe blamed any mistakes on \u201c human error , \u201d and \u201c lack of update \u201d or \u201c technical support.\n\u201d Poulos said the errors occurred in Antrim because they forgot to update their tabulators .\n\u201c @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stated in a court filing \u2026 \u2018 the ( forensics ) report makes a series of unsupported conclusions , ascribes motives of fraud and obfuscation to processes that are easily explained as routine election procedures or error corrections\u2026The reason we are now talking about Antrim County has to do with a series of human errors , \u201d he said .\nBut when asked if there is any method of voting that \u2019 s \u201c 100 % secure , \u201d back on January 9th , 2020 in sworn testimony before the House Administration Committee @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that an HBO documentary titled Kill Chain : The Cyber War On America \u2019 s Elections , released in March , openly outlines Dominion \u2019 s inherent vulnerabilities .\nAlso , a lengthy opinion and order from Judge Amy Totenberg in Curling v. Raffensperger , 2020 WL 5994029 , filed in October in Georgia , found \u201c extreme \u201d and unacceptable security risks in the Dominion system .\nAnd Texas rejected certification of their Democracy Suite system on three occasions was denied certification .\nCritics agree that the adjudication process is the simplest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ adjudication , usually conducted in batches , is when a potentially spoiled ballot is fixed and hence saved .\nInstead of tossing ballots out , they are reversed and sent to adjudication for a decision by election personnel .\nIn Michigan , a staggering number of votes required adjudication .\nFor instance , in Central Lake Township , there were 1,222 ballots reversed out of 1,491 total ballots cast , resulting in an 81.96 % rejection rate .\nIn Antrim , the tabulation log for the forensic examination of the server from December @ @ @ @ @ @ @ events , of which 10,667 or 68.05 % of the events were recorded errors .\nThe allowable election error rate established by the Federal Election Commission guidelines is 1 in 250,000 ballots or 0.008 % .\nThe forensic report remarked that administrators could theoretically change results while adjudication files could be moved with no audit trail .\n\u201c This was a 2020 issue not seen in previous election cycles still stored on the server , \u201d stated ASOG cofounder Russell Ramsland Jr , a former Reagan administration official who has worked for NASA @ @ @ @ @ @ @ errors in the system .\nThe intentional errors lead to bulk adjudication of ballots with no oversight , no transparency , or audit trail .\nOur examination of the server logs indicates that this high error rate was incongruent with patterns from previous years.\n\u201d Ramsland added that attributing these issues to human error is not consistent with the forensic evaluation , which points more correctly to a systemic machine and/or software errors .\nIncidentally , these errors occurred after the Antrim County Clerk provided a re-provisioned CF card with uploaded software for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nThe Dominion Voting System produced systemic errors and high error rates both prior to the update and after the update ; meaning the update ( or lack thereof ) was not the cause of errors .\nYet Poulos painted a different picture .\nHe insisted that errors occurred because of human oversight .\n\u201c If all of the tabulators had been updated as per procedure , there wouldn \u2019 t have been any error in the unofficial reporting .\nIf public Logic and Accuracy testing had taken place , the error would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have been caught , prior to the election .\nIf steps weren \u2019 t specifically taken to salvage the already printed ballots , the system would not have allowed election officials to upload memory cards , and the reporting error never would have occurred.\n\u201d He went on to explain that Antrim hasn \u2019 t licensed their digital adjudication tool .\n\u201c With digital adjudication , the original ballot is never changed , and a full audit trail shows the original image , shows who the bi-partisan adjudicators were and what they agreed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they made per State law.\n\u201d Counties that don \u2019 t use this software tool adjudicate manually by creating new ballots when needed .\n\u201c In Antrim county , ballots are reconciled manually .\nWhat the report is alleging is impossible because Antrim County does not license nor use digital adjudication , \u201d he stated during the hearing .\n\u201c Furthermore , digital adjudication requires the use of ballot images .\nAntrim County did not record absentee ballot images .\nAny U.S. Election Assistance Commission ( EAC ) accredited voting systems testing laboratory @ @ @ @ @ @ @ verify whether adjudication is used by review of the database structure\u2026The reason we are now talking about Antrim County has to do with a series of human errors.\n\u201d Significantly , the forensics report also discovered that the computer system showed vote adjudication logs for prior years ; but all adjudication log entries for the 2020 election cycle were missing .\nRepeat , the logs were wiped to track voting changes , rendering them now impossible to audit .\nWhy are all server security logs prior to 11:03 pm on November 4 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ security logs for the day after the election , on election day , and prior to election day are gone .\n\u201c The lack of records prevents any form of audit accountability , and their conspicuous absence is extremely suspicious since the files exist for previous years using the same software .\nRemoval of these files violates state law and prevents a meaningful audit , even if the Secretary wanted to conduct an audit .\nWe must conclude that the 2020 election cycle records have been manually removed , \u201d reads the report @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as \u201c bizarre \u201d and \u201c entirely false , \u201d insisting that the paper ballots do match the machine totals ; therefore , no problems were identified with his software .\nHe also added that because there was no automated adjudication process , there were no logs that were missing .\n\u201c In many circumstances , source code is delivered by hand by State certification officials.\n\u201d TRIES At The Ministry of Truth \u201c The Party controls and constructs all sources of information in Oceania , including the type of news and media @ @ @ @ @ @ @ These days , lies are weaved into truths .\nI call them \u201c tries.\n\u201d In an information war , tries are very difficult to catch unless you pay very close attention , keep track of details , and connect the dots .\nThe Ministry of Truth is slick , vaporizing words and reality with warp speed .\nWith that said , many watching Poulos remarked that his testimony was rife with lies .\nSome were a bit gentler .\n\u201c He was very good at talking around issues , \u201d says Brenda @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Integrity Fund .\n\u201c Things are now as clear as mud.\n\u201d One of the first red flags was when Polous said his company has been the target of a disinfo campaign that defies \u2018 facts or logic.\n\u2019 \u201c Unfortunately , Dominion has recently been thrust into the national spotlight as part of a dangerous and reckless disinformation campaign aimed at sowing doubt and confusion over the 2020 presidential election\u2026To date , no one has produced credible evidence of vote fraud or vote switching on Dominion systems because these things simply have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would affirm that plenty of credible evidence has been presented to at least beckon an investigation ; and that two , Dominion is the one helping spearhead a disinfo campaign , going as far as to say in a press release that this was \u201c the most secure election in U.S. history.\n\u201d Michigan Secretary of State Jocelyn Benson , a Democrat , also echoed this sentiment , following the forensic report , stating \u201c Let \u2019 s be clear : Michigan \u2019 s Nov. 3 general election in Michigan and across the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nation \u2019 s history .\nThere continues to be no evidence of widespread fraud.\n\u201d At this stage , these statements don \u2019 t reflect well .\nIncidentally , Benson also said that questioning the election is akin to attacking democracy .\nMany many others , included the mainstream media , have also parroted this notion .\n\u201c Amplifying these obviously false narratives about fraud or irregularities corrodes public trust ; it threatens national security ; and it weakens our democracy and our standing around the world , \u201d said Senator Gary Peters @ @ @ @ @ @ @ GOP-controlled Senate committee .\nThese sentiments are dead wrong and arguably dangerous .\nA democratic process invites others to ask questions , and a robust and uninhibited debate is crucial , as is a fair and unfettered marketplace for info .\nThat is why we have the Bill of Rights in the form of the First Amendment .\n\u201c Calling anyone who is using their God-given right to speak out that is enshrined in our Constitution about anything as attacking democracy is just plain silly , \u201d writes Podcast producer and host LADuke @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Keep making sure that your voices are heard in a strong firm way with no hint of anger or escalating to violence .\nThat is about the most patriotic thing you can do in this democracy ( actually republic ) that most of us love and cherish.\n\u201d Poulos also stated that when there is a digital adjudication process , there will be a computer connected to the tabulator , and it will record an image of the ballot , for auditing purposes .\nHe reiterated that Antrim \u2019 s tabulators were not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dominion voting machines were connected to the Internet , according to whistleblower Mellissa Carone who worked at the TCF Center in Detroit .\nShe said she was actually given a binder that included information on how \u201c the machines were connected to the Wi-Fi.\n\u201d \u201c All the tabulator computers were connected via Ethernet cables to a network router , \u201d adds Patrick Colbeck .\n\u201c And that router , in turn , was connected to another router that was connected to the adjudicators .\nThose were connected to another router/firewall which was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ connected to the local data center.\n\u201d Meanwhile , fired Director of Cyber Security Chris Krebs told the US Senate Homeland Security Committee on Wednesday December 16th that some Dominion Voting Machines were connected to the Internet .\nKrebs , who has worked for Microsoft , debunked some of the claims in the report saying they were \u201c misinterpreted.\n\u201d Next , Poulos said that Dominion doesn \u2019 t use \u201c SolarWinds \u201d for its monitoring system in his hearing .\n\u201c Dominion Voting Systems has not now , nor has it ever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was the subject of DHS emergency declaration dated December 13 2020 .\nSolarWwinds was involved in one of the most sophisticated and perhaps largest hacks , involving the Treasury and Commerce Departments .\n\u201c Now we know why Dominion deleted \u2018 \u201c SolarWinds \u2019 \u201d from their website , \u201d wrote former 8kun admin CodeMonkey .\nMany of us visited the site and saw the SolarWinds logo on Dominion \u2019 s page until it soon disappeared .\n\u201c This guy is a wordsmithing liar , \u201d remarked another person on Twitter .\nFinally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ voting systems in 28 U.S. states , and Dominion asserted in an opinion piece that \u201c Dominion is a nonpartisan , American company , \u201d while Polous neglected to say that he is a Canadian citizen who donates exclusively to liberal parties and politicians .\nAnother critique was that the senators lacked the level of technology needed to properly question Poulos .\n\u201c The attendees just took the CEO \u2019 s responses at face value ; no challenges .\nDisgusting , \u201d wrote one person on Twitter .\nAnother person added , \u201c @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bunch that were not up to speed with technology asking the questions .\nKind of a wasted opportunity.\n\u201d Patrick Colbeck , a former Michigan state senator , governor candidate , and founder of Let \u2019 s Fix It , agrees that the substantial questions that needed to be asked , were not .\nThis is despite the fact that he himself made a concerted effort to collect tech-based questions addressing the forensics report and Dominion , and supplied them to the senators .\nWhile the senators did ask a few questions , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nMore scrutiny was required since this wasn \u2019 t \u2018 just an add water \u2019 type of election process , \u201d added Colbeck who served for two terms as Michigan state senator from the northwestern portion of Wayne County , which includes Detroit .\nHe also spent 24 hours as a GOP poll watcher at the TCF Center in downtown Detroit .\nFollowing the Senate Oversight Committee hearing , Lisa Lyons of Kent County put out a statement : But per the Constitution , President Trump can still win this election , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nJenna Ellis argues that President Donald Trump still has time to challenge the election results and that state legislatures still have time to decide which set of votes from dueling slates of delegates to send to Congress on Jan. 6 , the day when the Electoral College votes are counted .\nTexas electors voted 34-4 to call on Legislatures in Pennsylvania , Georgia , Michigan and Wisconsin \u2014 whose election results handed the White House at Joe Biden \u2014 to appoint their own electors .\nSeven states will be bringing forth their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ January 6th \u2014 when the official electoral votes are counted \u2014 more fraud could be uncovered .\nWatch Attorney Matthew DePerno and I discuss the results of the Dominion Voting Systems forensic audit from Antrim County , Michigan .\nOnly one senator is needed to bring forth debate .\nRand Paul may join Congressman Mo Brooks , who has already filed an objection to electoral votes .\n\u201c We \u2019 ll make our decision after we \u2019 ve seen all the legal challenges , \u201d Paul recently said .\nIn the interim , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lawsuit .\nAnd Michigan officials are working to reverse redacted portions of the forensics report from Antrim that Assistant Attorney General Erik Gill successfully pursued , under the premise that the data uncovered \u201c source code \u201d proprietary to Dominion .\n\u201c Analysts assert that this data was merely configuration settings not source code , \u201d adds Colbeck .\n\u201c But , if so , Mr. Gill may have inadvertently added fuel to the fire of violations of the Help America Vote Act if any of this \u201c source code \u201d was modified @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recertification of the software.\n\u201d Colbeck analyzed and commented on the data in the report on his site .\nThere he remarks that the Dominion Rank Choice Voting algorithm , allowing a percentage of votes to be shifted from one candidate to another candidate resulting in \u201c fractional votes , \u201d was indeed \u201c enabled.\n\u201d Under oath , Poulos stated that \u201c there is no algorithm that enabled \u2018 fractional \u2019 voting.\n\u201d I will leave you with two of the many insightful possibilities projected by the Integrity Transition Project : \u201c @ @ @ @ @ @ @ encouraging the state legislatures in Pennsylvania , Wisconsin and Michigan to certify a separate slate of electors in support of President Trump .\nDespite opposition from the Biden Campaign and Democrats , both Michigan and Pennsylvania \u2019 s legislators agree to send two sets of electors in support of Trump.\n\u201d \u201c The outcome of the scenario hinged on how the elected officials from the two parties addressed the separate slate of electors from Michigan .\nGOP officials asserted that as the President of the Senate , Vice President Pence could legally choose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wished .\nThere was no clear resolution of the conflict in the January 6 joint session of Congress ; the partisans on both sides were still claiming victory , leading to the problem of two claims to Commander-in-Chief power ( including access to the nuclear codes ) at noon on January 20.\n\u201d Here is the redacted Antrim forensic report .\nSubscribe to Activist Post for truth , peace , and freedom news .\nSend resources to the front lines of peace and freedom HERE !\nFollow us on SoMee , HIVE , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Twitter .\nProvide , Protect and Profit from what \u2019 s coming !\nGet a free issue of Counter Markets today .", "author": "Activist Post", "url": "https://www.activistpost.com/2020/12/the-dissent-of-democracy-more-mischief-miffs-in-michigan.html", "published": "Fri, 18 Dec 2020 01:16:08 +0000", "published_utc": 1608272168, "collection_utc": 1608255050}, {"id": "activistpost--2020-12-18--Former Goldman CFO Calls For Universal Basic Income \u201cTo Stave Off Revolution\u201d", "date": "2020-12-18", "source": "activistpost", "title": "Former Goldman CFO Calls For Universal Basic Income \u201cTo Stave Off Revolution\u201d", "content": "Former Goldman Sachs CFO Marty Chavez thinks that income redistribution via Universal Basic Income ( UBI ) is the only way to stave off revolution as the wealth gap continues to increase .\nIn an interview with The Business of Business , host Gregory Ugwi asked Chavez if he agrees with Rep.

Authorization Act ( NDAA ) .\nThe Senate \u2019 s vote follows a 335 to 78 vote by the House of Representatives .\nDespite promises of a veto from Donald Trump , the bill currently has a veto-proof two-thirds majority in both the House and Senate .\nTrump has until December 23rd to decide if he try to veto the $ 740.5 billion bill .\nMost of the media discussion about the 2021 NDAA has revolved around @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to renaming military bases named after Confederate war heroes and the battle over Section 230 of the Communication Act .\nTrump has stated that his admin \u201c will not even consider the renaming of these Magnificent and Fabled Military Installations \u201d .\nHe also threatened to veto the massive spending bill if Section 230 of the Communication Act was not \u201c completely terminated \u201d to allow internet providers and Big Tech companies like Facebook and Twitter to be held legally liable for the content on their websites .\nTrump has argued the social @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to reduce online censorship or deletion of content falsely labeled \u201c misinformation \u201d .\nWhile the discussions about the names of military bases and Section 230 arguably have their place in a discussion on the 2021 NDAA , an exclusive focus on these topics ignores troubling concerns in the remainder of the bill .\nWhite House Press Secretary Kayleigh McEnany stated that Trump is concerned about a provision in the bill relating to troop withdrawal and deployment in Afghanistan , South Korea , and Germany .\nThe NDAA includes amendments that seek to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Germany .\nIf these new amendments are included in the bill it would require a review from several government agencies prior to any future troop withdrawals .\nOn December 10 , Senator Rand Paul spoke out about provisions in the NDAA 2021 , stating that the new bill would prevent future presidents from being able to withdraw troops without consulting with Congress first .\nPaul said these provisions would prolong the failed War on Terror .\nAnother product of the War on Terror ( aka the War on Freedom ) is a provision @ @ @ @ @ @ @ included in the 2011 version of the bill .\nSome readers may recall that since 2011 the NDAA has included a provision which allows for indefinite detention of American citizens without a right to trial .\nThe bill was signed into law by former President Obama and the indefinite detention provision is still contained in the NDAA , having been approved by Congress every year since it first passed .\nWhen the indefinite detention clause was first included there were many mainstream news reports discussing the dangerous potential for the provision .\nThere @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even a federal lawsuit that ultimately failed to remove the provision .\nHowever , as we approach 2021 there is hardly a mention of the indefinite detention clause anywhere in corporate media .\nUnfortunately , there appears to be very few in the political world willing to speak up about the issue .\nOne of the few to speak up during the recent round of voting is Justin Amash , a Libertarian representing Michigan \u2019 s 3rd Congressional District .\nAmash has consistently spoken out against the indefinite detention clause .\nOn December @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tweeting , \u201c Voted no on the NDAA .\nVoted no on all the NDAAs .\nBring home the troops .\nStop indefinite detention without charge or trial .\nFight the military-industrial complex.\n\u201d Become an Activist Post Patron for just $ 1 per month at Patreon .\nWithout a proper understanding that the NDAA is the ever-growing blank check for the military industrial complex that allows for indefinite detention of Americans , the public is hopelessly lost .\nUntil the general public is aware of the danger of these measures they will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by a government and media desperate to continue the war machine .\nWhile the corporate media is playing out a fake drama \u2013 will Trump really veto the NDAA ?\n?\n\u2013 there is no mention of the fact that American citizens are still susceptible to indefinite detention ( no trial , no jury ) if accused of \u201c terrorism \u201d , and there is an even bigger threat to American \u2019 s privacy and liberty .\nDue to the fact that the annual NDAA is a must-pass bill , many politicians attach @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the bill would never be rejected by any \u201c patriotic \u201d American \u2013 or a politician who does not want to be labeled \u201c anti-American \u201d .\nThe 2021 NDAA includes dozens of new initiatives and updates to existing departments related to the growth of Artificial Intelligence ( AI ) .\nThe change requires the JAIC to report directly to the Deputy Secretary of Defense .\nThis elevation of the DOD \u2019 s Joint AI Center is a sign that U.S. military leadership is taking serious the rise of AI and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The 2021 NDAA also includes a previous bill known as the AI Initiative Act that will create a new organization known as the National Artificial Intelligence Initiative Office under the White House \u2019 s Office of Science and Technology Policy .\nThe Act will increase federal spending on AI research and increase coordination across government agencies .\nAnother bill , the National AI Research Resource Task Force Act , calls on the National Science Foundation to investigate methods for AI research funding .\nThe bill also includes what has been called \u201c one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to date.\n\u201d FedScoop reports that recommendations issued by the Cyberspace Solarium Commission \u2013 a commission created by the 2019 NDAA \u2013 made it into the final version of the 2021 NDAA .\nThe recommendations included creating a national cyber director in the White House .\nConcerns about the rise of AI \u2013 and the dangers it poses to liberty and privacy \u2013 date back to 2015 , when Stephen Hawking , Elon Musk , and other academics signed a letter warning that the push towards AI could lead to a global arms @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on Artificial Intelligence , called for banning AI technology that humans \u201c have no meaningful control over.\n\u201d While the media ignores the massive injection of bills related to AI , several prominent voices in Congress are claiming that passing the 2021 NDAA is more important than ever due to the alleged hacking of U.S. government networks .\nIn recent days , the corporate media has unquestionably repeated claims that the Russian government hacked U.S. networks using malware embedded in network management software made by the firm SolarWinds .\nSenator Angus King of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Solarium Commission , stated that the SolarWinds \u201c hack \u201d proves why Trump must sign the 2021 NDAA .\n\u201c This is the most important bill on cyber ever passed by Congress , and that \u2019 s why I \u2019 m really hoping that the president will either sign the bill or let it become law without a signature , because there is so much critically important material in the bill , \u201d King said during an annual summit hosted by Defense One .\nThe timing of the apparent hack is convenient for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the military unlimited financial resources with

"Within hours , Congress is set to vote on ( and pass ) a $ 900 billion Covid-19 aid bill that includes assistance for households and businesses , as well as funding for vaccine distribution and more .\nAs discussed previously , the bill excludes the Republican priority of liability protections for businesses and other entities , and left the key Democrat demand of state and local bailouts .\nIn a nutshell , the new package extends federal UI programs ( e.g .\nPUA , PEUC ) with an extra $ 300/week for all UI claimants for at least an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ another round of stimulus checks worth $ 600 per individual per household for those making less than $ 75k ( $ 150k for married couples ) and gradually phases out at higher incomes .\nThe bill renews funding for PPP to support small businesses and provides targeted aid to transportation and other hard hit sectors of the economy .\nSimilar to the prior bipartisan proposal , $ 325bn would go to small businesses support , including $ 284bn for a second round of PPP grants .\nOf note : the bill also allows @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first round of loans , which the Treasury had previously disallowed ( i.e.\n, a double dip ) .\nWith around $ 525bn in forgivable PPP loans issued and more coming , this looks likely to reduce tax receipts by tens of billions and possibly more than $ 100bn , though it depends on the profitability of the businesses that received the loans .\nIt also provides additional funding for schools , healthcare , SNAP , childcare and various other programs .\nWhile the package excludes aid for state and local government and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ schools as BofA notes , many of the provisions ( e.g .\naid for public transportation , schools , funding for vaccine distribution , testing and tracing ) will channel aid to state and local governments Here are the details of what is in the legislation .\nDirect Payments : The legislation would authorize a second round of economic-impact payments , following the checks Americans received in the spring and summer , at a cost of $ 166 billion .\nHouseholds would receive $ 600 for each adult and $ 600 for each @ @ @ @ @ @ @ $ 500 , respectively , in the first round .\nMixed-status households , where some people are ineligible noncitizens , would get payments based on the number of eligible people in the households , as opposed to being shut out as they were in the first round .\nThe payments would be based on income from 2019 and begin phasing out for individuals with adjusted gross incomes over $ 75,000 and married couples over $ 150,000 .\nTreasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said Monday that the first electronic payments could reach bank accounts by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whose incomes were too high to qualify or who added dependents in 2020 might not qualify for full payments immediately .\nBut they can request additional money as part of the 2020 tax returns they will file in early 2021 .\nJobless Aid : Workers would be eligible for a $ 300-a-week federal unemployment subsidy .\nAs with the prior aid package enacted in March , gig workers and others who don \u2019 t ordinarily qualify for benefits would be eligible for the jobless aid .\nThe money is available through March 14 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 50 weeks the amount of time for which workers may claim benefits through both state and federal programs .\nMost states typically provide 26 weeks of jobless benefits .\nThe measure also provides an additional $ 100-a-week subsidy for workers who have both wage and self-employment income but whose basic unemployment benefits don \u2019 t take into account their self-employment income .\nThe cost of the enhanced unemployment benefits are projected at $ 120 billion .\nRental Assistance : The bill provides $ 25 billion of assistance to tenants in arrears on their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ end of January 2021 a federal eviction prohibition , which the incoming Biden administration may extend again .\nThe Treasury Department would be responsible for dispersing the rental assistance to states via a formula based on population .\nLandlords and building owners can apply on behalf of tenants meeting the eligibility requirements , generally those who make less than 80 % of median income in their area , have at least one person in their households who has lost a job and can demonstrate they are at risk of losing their home .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ 9 billion for health-care providers and $ 4.5 billion for mental health , as well as more than $ 1 billion for the National Institutes of Health to conduct Covid-19 research .\nSchools : The bill provides $ 82 billion for public and private K-12 schools , as well as colleges .\nOf that , the bulk would go to a $ 54.3 billion fund for public schools , while $ 22.7 billion would go to public and private higher education .\nTesting and Tracing : States would receive $ 22 billion for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nOf this , $ 2.5 billion would be sent as grants targeting rural areas and communities of color .\nVaccines : States and federal agencies would receive funding for vaccine distribution .\nAbout $ 20 billion would go to the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority , or Barda , for procuring vaccines and therapeutics .\nNearly $ 9 billion would go to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and states for further distribution of the vaccine , and $ 3 billion is designated for the national stockpile .\nIncluded in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is directed to go to high-risk areas and to communities of color .\nAirlines : Tens of thousands of airline employees would get their jobs back , at least for a few months , under the new bill , which includes $ 15 billion to cover airline salaries and benefits through the end of March .\nThe bill also includes $ 1 billion for airline contractor payrolls .\nAirlines received $ 25 billion under the Cares Act in the spring to cover workers \u2019 pay and benefits , and in exchange agreed not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Oct. 1 .\nAs that date neared without much improvement in their outlook , carriers and labor unions warned that job cuts would be coming and pleaded for another round of aid .\nWhen it didn \u2019 t arrive in time , they furloughed tens of thousands of workers , including 19,000 at American Airlines Group Inc. and over 13,000 at United Airlines Holdings Inc .\nThe bill also includes $ 2 billion for airports and airport-based businesses .\nBanks : The bill would provide $ 12 billion in support to small lenders @ @ @ @ @ @ @ buttressing minority-owned banks and firms known as community financial development institutions .\nEntertainment Venues : The bill has $ 15 billion for independent movie theaters , live entertainment venues and cultural institutions .\nFarms : The U.S. agriculture sector is set for another multibillion-dollar injection in the new relief bill , which directs $ 13 billion to crop farmers , cattle ranchers and rural communities .\nThe new aid would come on top of roughly $ 46 billion that the U.S. Department of Agriculture projects the federal government will directly pay to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a record .\nThat sum includes previous Covid-19 relief for farmers who had to plow up fields of produce ordinarily destined for restaurants , as well as hog producers who had to euthanize livestock because of pandemic-driven shutdowns at meatpacking plants .\nRail and transit : The bill would provide $ 1 billion in relief funds to Amtrak , aimed at helping the national passenger railroad avoid further layoffs and furloughs of its workers .\nAmtrak receives a regular operating subsidy of around $ 2 billion a year from the federal government , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the pandemic and lockdown orders .\nRidership on some routes fell by more than 90 % this year .\nThe company says it will need a total of $ 4.9 billion in relief aid to get through the remainder of the year without deeper worker and service cuts .\nThe bill also sets aside $ 14 billion for transit systems , many of which are considering major cuts in service and layoffs .\nIn New York City alone , elected officials say they need an immediate $ 4.5 billion infusion to stave off @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nThe bill also sets aside $ 2 billion for the bus industry and $ 10 billion for state highways .\nSmall Business : The $ 325 billion allotted to help small businesses includes $ 284 billion for first and second forgivable Paycheck Protection Program loans , and expands eligibility for local newspapers and TV and radio broadcasters .\nThe bill also includes $ 20 billion for Economic Injury Disaster Loans .\nBusinesses that received PPP loans would be able to take tax deductions for the expenses covered by forgiven loans , overcoming @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would save businesses about $ 200 billion , according to an estimate from Adam Looney of the Brookings Institution .\nBut it doesn \u2019 t count as part of the overall cost of the legislation .\nU.S .\nPostal Service : The bill loosens some of the strings imposed on the U.S .\nPostal Service from the Cares Act , which provided a $ 10 billion Treasury loan after terms were negotiated .\nThe bill would still provide $ 10 billion to the financially strained institution , but the Postal Service wouldn \u2019 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the conditions imposed by the Treasury wouldn \u2019 t apply .\nIn exchange , the bill would require the Postal Service to provide more information to Congress , including a plan about its long-term financial solvency , within 180 days of the bill \u2019 s passing and information about how it plans to use the funds in reports to the Postal Regulatory Commission .\nTaxes : Aside from the PPP break , the bill would extend a tax credit for struggling employers who keep workers on the payroll , and it would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ based on their 2019 incomes ; in some cases , lower 2020 incomes could reduce their eligibility .\nThe bill would also temporarily extend tax breaks for renewable energy , including incentives for wind energy and carbon capture .\nIt also includes deductions for business meals , a provision that President Trump backed but that faced criticism from Democrats as a subsidy for three-martini lunches and indoor dining during a pandemic .\nLower excise taxes on beer , wine and spirits that were set to expire Dec. 31 will be permanently extended , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ areas and hiring workers from disadvantaged groups would be extended for five years .\nBased on cost estimates of the various provisions and applying the corresponding fiscal multipliers ( Chart 1 ) , Bank of America estimates that the new stimulus package will contribute approximately 2.7 % to growth in 2021 .\nThe bank now expects that more of the stimulus impact will be frontloaded into 1Q ( Chart 2 ) .\nThe start of the year has cross currents with weaker economic data but an earlier and more targeted fiscal stimulus ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nOn balance , the bank now sees upside risk to the bank \u2019 s forecast of 1 % GDP growth in 1Q .\nOne final point : no more stimulus ?\nAs we reported last week , Goldman \u2019 s economists believe that this is the last major COVID-focused fiscal package .\nAssuming that President-elect Biden is facing a divided Congress next year , this looks likely to be the last fiscal package that Congress passes worth several hundred billion dollars or more ( as by 2021 Covid vaccines will be widely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stimulus virtually impossible ) .\nThat said , Goldman does expect another debate over fiscal support in Q1 , ahead of the expiration of the extended unemployment provisions in March .\nHowever , since Congress left the most difficult issues out of the current package , it seems unlikely that lawmakers will be able to agree on those in subsequent legislation .\nOf course , this would likely change if Democrats win both Senate seats in Georgia on January 5 and reach 50 seats in the Senate .\nIn that scenario , Goldman @ @ @ @ @ @ @

Torched", "content": "No doubt about it : 2020\u2014a terrible , horrible , no good , very bad year for freedom\u2014was the culmination of a terrible , horrible , no good , very bad decade for freedom .\nGovernment corruption , tyranny , and abuse coupled with a Big Brother-knows-best mindset and the COVID-19 pandemic propelled us at warp speed towards a full-blown police state in which nationwide lockdowns , egregious surveillance , roadside strip searches , police shootings of unarmed citizens , censorship , retaliatory arrests , the criminalization of lawful activities , warmongering , indefinite detentions , SWAT team raids , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prisons , and pay-to-play politicians were accepted as the norm .\nHere \u2019 s just a small sampling of the laundry list of abuses\u2014cruel , brutal , immoral , unconstitutional and unacceptable\u2014that have been heaped upon us by the government over the past two decades and in the past year , in particular .\nThe government failed to protect our lives , liberty and happiness .\nThe predators of the police state wreaked havoc on our freedoms , our communities , and our lives .\nThe government didn \u2019 t listen to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Constitution , and treated the citizenry as a source of funding and little else .\nPolice officers shot unarmed citizens and their household pets .\nGovernment agents\u2014including local police\u2014were armed to the teeth and encouraged to act like soldiers on a battlefield .\nBloated government agencies were allowed to fleece taxpayers .\nGovernment technicians spied on our emails and phone calls .\nAnd government contractors made a killing by waging endless wars abroad .\nThe American President became more imperial .\nAlthough the Constitution invests the President with very specific , limited powers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( Trump , Obama , Bush , Clinton , etc . )\nclaimed the power to completely and almost unilaterally alter the landscape of this country for good or for ill .\nThe powers that have been amassed by each successive president through the negligence of Congress and the courts\u2014powers which add up to a toolbox of terror for an imperial ruler\u2014empower whoever occupies the Oval Office to act as a dictator , above the law and beyond any real accountability .\nThe presidency itself has become an imperial one with permanent powers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ themselves , 911 calls turned deadly , and traffic stops took a turn for the worse .\nLacking in transparency and accountability , protected by the courts and legislators , and rife with misconduct , America \u2019 s police forces continued to be a menace to the citizenry and the rule of law .\nDespite concerns about the government \u2019 s steady transformation of local police into a standing military army , local police agencies acquired even more weaponry , training and equipment suited for the battlefield .\nPolice officers were also given @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a variety of reasons and subject them to forced cavity searches , forced colonoscopies , forced blood draws , forced breath-alcohol tests , forced DNA extractions , forced eye scans , forced inclusion in biometric databases .\nThe courts failed to uphold justice .\nWith every ruling handed down , it becomes more apparent that we live in an age of hollow justice , with government courts more concerned with protecting government agents than upholding the rights of \u201c we the people.\n\u201d This is true at all levels of the judiciary , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the land , the U.S. Supreme Court , which is seemingly more concerned with establishing order and protecting government agents than with upholding the rights enshrined in the Constitution .\nA review of critical court rulings over the past two decades , including some ominous ones by the U.S. Supreme Court , reveals a startling and steady trend towards pro-police state rulings by an institution concerned more with establishing order and protecting the ruling class and government agents than with upholding the rights enshrined in the Constitution .\nCOVID-19 allowed the Emergency @ @ @ @ @ @ @ started out as an apparent effort to prevent a novel coronavirus from sickening the nation ( and the world ) became yet another means by which world governments ( including our own ) could expand their powers , abuse their authority , and further oppress their constituents .\nWhile COVID-19 took a significant toll on the nation emotionally , physically , and economically , it also allowed the government to trample our rights in the so-called name of national security , with talk of mass testing for COVID-19 antibodies , screening checkpoints , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vaccinations , snitch tip lines and onerous lockdowns .\nThe Surveillance State rendered Americans vulnerable to threats from government spies , police , hackers and power failures .\nThanks to the government \u2019 s ongoing efforts to build massive databases using emerging surveillance , DNA and biometrics technologies , Americans have become sitting ducks for hackers and government spies alike .\nBillions of people have been affected by data breaches and cyberattacks .\nOn a daily basis , Americans have been made to relinquish the most intimate details of who we are\u2014our biological @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our biometrics ( facial characteristics and structure , fingerprints , iris scans , etc . )\n\u2014in order to navigate an increasingly technologically-enabled world .\nBecome an Activist Post Patron for just $ 1 per month at Patreon .\nAmerica became a red flag nation .\nRed flag laws , specifically , and pre-crime laws generally push us that much closer towards a suspect society where everyone is potentially guilty of some crime or another and must be preemptively rendered harmless .\nWhere many Americans go wrong is in naively assuming that you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ harmful in order to be flagged and targeted for some form of intervention or detention .\nIn fact , all you need to do these days to end up on a government watch list or be subjected to heightened scrutiny is use certain trigger words ( like cloud , pork and pirates ) , surf the internet , communicate using a cell phone , limp or stutter , drive a car , stay at a hotel , attend a political rally , express yourself on social media , appear mentally ill , serve @ @ @ @ @ @ @ law enforcement official , call in sick to work , purchase materials at a hardware store , take flying or boating lessons , appear suspicious , appear confused or nervous , fidget or whistle or smell bad , be seen in public waving a toy gun or anything remotely resembling a gun ( such as a water nozzle or a remote control or a walking cane ) , stare at a police officer , question government authority , appear to be pro-gun or pro-freedom , or generally live in the United States .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ such a government watch list\u2014whether it \u2019 s a terrorist watch list , a mental health watch list , a dissident watch list , or a red flag gun watch list\u2014there \u2019 s no clear-cut way to get off , whether or not you should actually be on there .\nThe cost of policing the globe drove the nation deeper into debt .\nAmerica \u2019 s war spending has already bankrupted the nation to the tune of more than $ 20 trillion dollars .\nPolicing the globe and waging endless wars abroad hasn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the world\u2014any safer , but it has made the military industrial complex rich at taxpayer expense .\nThe U.S. military reportedly has more than 1.3 million men and women on active duty , with more than 200,000 of them stationed overseas in nearly every country in the world .\nYet America \u2019 s military forces aren \u2019 t being deployed abroad to protect our freedoms here at home .\nRather , they \u2019 re being used to guard oil fields , build foreign infrastructure and protect the financial interests of the corporate elite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ military spends about $ 81 billion a year just to protect oil supplies around the world .\nThis is how a military empire occupies the globe .\nMeanwhile , America \u2019 s infrastructure is falling apart .\nFree speech was dealt one knock-out punch after another .\nProtest laws , free speech zones , bubble zones , trespass zones , anti-bullying legislation , zero tolerance policies , hate crime laws , shadow banning on the Internet , and a host of other legalistic maladies dreamed up by politicians and prosecutors ( and championed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with which they might disagree ) conspired to corrode our core freedoms , purportedly for our own good .\nOn paper\u2014at least according to the U.S. Constitution\u2014we are technically free to speak .\nIn reality , however , we are only as free to speak as a government official\u2014or corporate entities such as Facebook , Google or YouTube\u2014may allow .\nThe reasons for such censorship varied widely from political correctness , so-called safety concerns and bullying to national security and hate crimes but the end result remained the same : the complete eradication @ @ @ @ @ @ @ took over .\nThe American system of representative government has been overthrown by the Deep State\u2014a.k.a .\nthe police state a.k.a .\nthe military/corporate industrial complex\u2014a profit-driven , militaristic corporate state bent on total control and global domination through the imposition of martial law here at home and by fomenting wars abroad .\nThe \u201c government of the people , by the people , for the people \u201d has perished .\nIn its place is a shadow government , a corporatized , militarized , entrenched bureaucracy that is fully operational and staffed by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , running the country and calling the shots in Washington DC , no matter who sits in the White House .\nMind you , by \u201c government , \u201d I \u2019 m not referring to the highly partisan , two-party bureaucracy of the Republicans and Democrats .\nRather , I \u2019 m referring to \u201c government \u201d with a capital \u201c G , \u201d the entrenched Deep State that is unaffected by elections , unaltered by populist movements , and has set itself beyond the reach of the law .\nThis is the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no respect for the freedom of its citizenry .\nThis shadow government , which \u201c operates according to its own compass heading regardless of who is formally in power , \u201d makes a mockery of elections and the entire concept of a representative government .\nThe takeaway : Everything the founders of this country feared has come to dominate in modern America .\n\u201c We the people \u201d have been saddled with a government that is no longer friendly to freedom and is working overtime to trample the Constitution underfoot and render the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ government \u2019 s power grabs , corruption and abusive tactics .\nSo how do you balance the scales of justice at a time when Americans are being tasered , tear-gassed , pepper-sprayed , hit with batons , shot with rubber bullets and real bullets , blasted with sound cannons , detained in cages and kennels , sicced by police dogs , arrested and jailed for challenging the government \u2019 s excesses , abuses and power-grabs , and then locked down and stripped of any semblance of personal freedom ?\nNo matter who sits @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u2019 t fix a system that is broken beyond repair .\nFor that matter , protests and populist movements also haven \u2019 t done much to push back against an authoritarian regime that is deaf to our cries , dumb to our troubles , blind to our needs , and accountable to no one .\nSo how do you not only push back against the government \u2019 s bureaucracy , corruption and cruelty but also launch a counterrevolution aimed at reclaiming control over the government using nonviolent means ?\nYou start by changing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nonviolent ) guerilla tactics .\nTake your cue from the Tenth Amendment and nullify everything the government does that flies in the face of the principles on which this nation was founded .\nIf there is any means left to us for thwarting the government in its relentless march towards outright dictatorship , it may rest with the power of juries and local governments to invalidate governmental laws , tactics and policies that are illegitimate , egregious or blatantly unconstitutional .\nIn an age in which government officials accused of wrongdoing\u2014police officers , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leniency , while the average citizen is prosecuted to the full extent of the law , nullification is a powerful reminder that , as the Constitution tells us , \u201c we the people \u201d are the government .\nFor too long we \u2019 ve allowed our so-called \u201c representatives \u201d to call the shots .\nNow it \u2019 s time to restore the citizenry to their rightful place in the republic : as the masters , not the servants .\nNullification is one way of doing so .\nAmerica was meant to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which is a far cry from the colossal federal bureaucracy we have today .\nYet if our freedoms are to be restored , understanding what is transpiring practically in your own backyard\u2014in one \u2019 s home , neighborhood , school district , town council\u2014and taking action at that local level must be the starting point .\nResponding to unmet local needs and reacting to injustices is what grassroots activism is all about .\nAttend local city council meetings , speak up at town hall meetings , organize protests and letter-writing campaigns , employ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disobedience , which Martin Luther King Jr. used to great effect through the use of sit-ins , boycotts and marches .\nThe power to change things for the better rests with us , not the politicians .\nAs long as we continue to allow callousness , cruelty , meanness , immorality , ignorance , hatred , intolerance , racism , militarism , materialism , meanness and injustice\u2014magnified by an echo chamber of nasty tweets and government-sanctioned brutality\u2014to trump justice , fairness and equality , there can be no hope of prevailing against the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nation if only Americans would work together to harness the power of their discontent and push back against the government \u2019 s overreach , excesses and abuse .\nAs I make clear in my book Battlefield America : The War on the American People , the police state is marching forward , more powerful than ever .\nIf there is to be any hope for freedom in 2021 , it rests with \u201c we the people.\n\u201d Constitutional attorney and author John W.

American Myths Were Ravaged", "content": "Thanks in large part to Covid lockdowns , this year has left vast wreckage in its wake , with ten million jobs lost , more than 100,000 businesses and dozens of national chains bankrupted or closed .\nUp to 40 million people could face eviction in the coming months for failing to pay rent , and Americans report that their mental health is at record low levels .\nBut the casualty list for 2020 must also include many of the political myths that shape Americans \u2019 lives .\nPerhaps the biggest myth to die this year was that Americans \u2019 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Rights .\nAfter the Covid-19 pandemic began , governors in state after state effectively placed scores of millions of citizens under house arrest \u2013 dictates that former Attorney General Bill Barr aptly compared to \u201c the greatest intrusion on civil liberties \u201d since the end of slavery .\nPoliticians and government officials merely had to issue decrees , which were endlessly

ordering four million people to \u201c to remain in their homes \u201d in a futile effort to banish a virus .\nThe Rule of Law is another myth impaled by 2020 \u2019 s dire developments .\nCourts have repeatedly struck down sweeping restrictions .\nFederal judge William Stickman IV invalidated some of Pennsylvania \u2019 s restrictions in a September ruling : \u201c Broad population-wide lockdowns are such a dramatic inversion of the concept of liberty in a free society as to be nearly presumptively unconstitutional.\n\u201d After the Michigan Supreme Court effectively @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , she responded by issuing \u201c new COVID-19 emergency orders that are nearly identical to her invalidated emergency orders , \u201d as the Mackinac Center noted .\nHow many governors and mayors have you seen on the television news being led away in handcuffs after their arrest for violating citizens \u2019 rights this year ?\nNone .\nAnother myth that 2020 obliterated was the notion that politicians spending more than a hundred billion dollars every year for science and public health would keep Americans safe .\nThe Centers for Disease Control utterly botched @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bogus tests to state and local health departments and taking a month and a half to do what the Thai government achieved in one day .\nThe Food and Drug Administration helped turn the coronavirus from a deadly peril into a national catastrophe .\nLong after foreign nations had been ravaged and many cases had been detected in America , the FDA continued blocking private testing .\nThe FDA continued forcing the nation \u2019 s most innovative firms to submit to its command-and-control approach , notwithstanding the pandemic .\nBecome an Activist Post @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at Patreon .\nThe benevolence and compassion of public school teachers was another myth that 2020 obliterated .\nTeacher unions helped barricade school doors the same way that segregationist governors in the 1950s and 1960s refused to obey federal court orders to admit black students .\nThe Chicago Teachers Union proclaimed : \u201c The push to reopen schools is based in sexism , racism , and misogyny.\n\u201d Black and Hispanic students suffered much larger learning losses due to school shutdowns , leading former Education Secretary John King to warn of a \u201c @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deluge of studies that showed that schools posed little risk of fueling the pandemic , teachers insisted that they were entitled to both their salaries and to stay at home as long as they considered necessary .\nThis was part of the collapse of the broader myth that the rulers and ruled have common interests .\nAmong other splits , the response to the pandemic divided Americans into those who work for a living , and those who \u201c work \u201d for the government .\nGovernment employees in most states and at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ continuing to draw full pay even when they were no longer even required to show up for work .\nOne exception to this trend is government tax collectors , who continue commandeering as much as ever from citizens and property owners regardless of the collapse in public services in many places this year .\nAnother myth that perished in 2020 was that social media and the Internet could be a powerful propellant of free information .\nInstead , the biggest players pulled the most strings to suppress criticisms or dissent from the latest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ March 18 , Twitter announced that , in response to Covid-19 , it would ban tweets guilty of \u201c denial of expert guidance \u201d or \u201c misleading content purporting to be from experts or authorities.\n\u201d The World Health Organization initially overestimated the Covid fatality rate by 50-fold but they remain Twitter-approved .\nFacebook recently launched far more aggressive policies , including directly contacting anyone who liked or commented on a piece that was later ruled erroneous by Facebook guardians and is refusing any ads that discourages people from getting vaccinations .\nWill @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Soumya Swaminathan for declaring on Monday that there was \u201c no evidence to be confident [ vaccine ] shots prevent transmission \u201d of Covid ?\nGoogle sought to suppress any doubts about lockdowns : \u201c Most users in English-speaking countries , when they google \u2018 Great Barrington Declaration \u2019 , will not be

to reducing cases to near zero .\nRegardless of the proclaimed rationale , most people submitted without a fight , and usually without even a whimper .\nPoliticians and bureaucrats fanned mass fears which quickly ripened into hatred of anyone who did not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and cities across the country set up snitch lines that were soon deluged with complaints of people outside without a mask ,

"William Barr Greenlit Bush\u2019s Invasion of Panama, Is Venezuela Next?", "content": "The US Justice Department unsealed an indictment on Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro and other government officials last week , accusing them of \u201c narco-terrorism.\n\u201d The move is reminiscent of the 1988 indictment of former CIA asset and Panamanian leader Manuel Noriega .\nThe Noriega indictment resulted in a US invasion of Panama that left hundreds \u2013 possibly thousands \u2013 of dead civilians in its wake .\nAttorney General William Barr took to the podium to announce Maduro \u2019 s indictment .\nBarr happens to be the same person who gave the first Bush administration the legal justification to invade @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Barr first worked in the DOJ in 1989 when George H. W. Bush appointed him as head of the Office of Legal Counsel ( OLC ) .\nBush and Barr had some history together .\nThe two first crossed paths in 1976 when Bush was head of the CIA , and Barr served as a congressional liaison for the agency .\nAt the time , Manuel Noriega was also on the CIA \u2019 s payroll .\nNoriega served as a useful tool for the CIA for decades , most notably known for helping @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Contras in Nicaragua .\nBut after Noriega became more of a liability than an asset , the US turned on him .\nNoriega \u2019 s connection to drug trafficking became the pretext for his disposal , something the US government was undoubtedly aware of long before the indictment .\nIn 1988 , the Senate subcommittee on terrorism , narcotics , and international operations said , \u201c It is clear that each US government agency which had a relationship with Noriega turned a blind eye to his corruption and drug dealing , even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ player on behalf of the Medellin Cartel ( Pablo Escobar \u2019 s infamous Colombian cartel ) .\n\u201d In February 1988 , under the Reagan administration , the US indicted Noriega on charges of Drug trafficking and racketeering , and he was taken off the CIA \u2019 s payroll .\nOver the next year , the US placed economic sanctions on Panama in an effort to pressure Noriega to step down .\nWhen Bush came into the White House in January 1989 , he continued adding sanctions , and tensions between Noriega \u2019 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Panama increased .\nThe US controlled the Panama Canal at the time , so there was a strong US military presence in the country , and tens of thousands of US citizens were living there .\nIt was around the time of ever-growing tensions between Noriega and the US that William Barr was asked by then-Attorney General Dick Thornburgh to author a legal opinion memo .\nThe purpose of Barr \u2019 s opinion memo was to overrule an opinion written in 1980 by President Carter \u2019 s head of the OLC that ruled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to arrest a person in another nation if that nation does not consent .\nThe opinion written under Carter said , \u201c US agents have no law enforcement authority in another nation unless it is the product of that nation \u2019 s consent.\n\u201d Barr \u2019 s opinion said that the FBI could carry out arrests in other nations , even if it violates international law .\nThe document , dated June 21st 1989 , reads , \u201c At the direction of the President or the Attorney General , the FBI may use @ @ @ @ @ @ @ individuals for violating United States law , even if the FBI \u2019 s actions contravene customary international law.\n\u201d In November 1989 , after the document \u2019 s existence became known , Barr testified before Congress on its contents .\nBarr refused to make the document itself public and did not disclose all of its contents , which caused some controversy , but that seemed to be a distraction from the real issue \u2013 the belief that the president is above international law .\nWriting in the Los Angeles Times in October 1989 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the White House dubbed Barr \u2019 s ruling \u201c the president \u2019 s snatch authority.\n\u201d Astrow speculated that this new authority could be used to arrest Noriega .\nOn December 20th 1989 , President Bush launched Operation Just Cause .\nOver 27,000 troops invaded Panama to arrest Noriega , the largest US military action since the Vietnam war .\nThe campaign was especially brutal for civilians .\nThe neighborhood of El Chorillo in Panama City saw the worst destruction .\nUS forces indiscriminately bombed El Chorillo without giving the residents any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the destruction of about 4,000 homes .\nHorrific stories of US tanks running over and crushing civilians surfaced after the invasion , and witnesses described a total disregard for civilian life by the US forces .\nThe civilian death toll given by the US government is around 200 , but that number is widely disputed .\nSome human rights groups say the number is in the thousands .\nEither number is horrific considering Noriega was captured on January 3rd 1990 , and the campaign only lasted two weeks .\nVictims claim many bodies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ counted , and to this day , families of the dead are still searching for the bodies of their loved ones .\nIn 2019 , Panama made December 20th an official day of mourning .\nBush did not get Congressional approval for the invasion , violating the War Powers Act that was passed in 1973 after President Nixon \u2019 s bombings of Cambodia and Laos .\nBush publicly justified the invasion on the grounds of self-defense .\nA US marine was killed in Panama a few days before the invasion , part of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ troops and the Panamanian military .\nSome reports say US troops were purposely provoking members of Panama \u2019 s armed forces .\nThe indictment of Noriega and the harsh economic sanctions were probably enough provocation to cause incidents between the two countries \u2019 armed forces .\nThe invasion violated at least two international treaties : The United Nations Charter and the Charter of the Organization of American States ( OAS ) .\nShortly after the invasion began , the OAS voted 20 to 1 in favor of an immediate US withdrawal .\nThe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a vote of 75 to 20 .\nBarr \u2019 s opinion memo made it clear that the Bush administration was not concerned with violating international law .\nBarr believed in a strong Executive branch and later advised Bush that he did not need Congressional approval for the war against Iraq .\nIn 1991 , Barr \u2019 s support for Bush \u2019 s leadership was rewarded , and he was nominated to be the 77th Attorney General of the United States .\nFast forward about 30 years later , and William Barr is back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Maduro , the DOJ placed a $ 15 million bounty on his head , offering that money for any information that leads to his arrest .\nIndicting a head of state is an incredible provocation , but by US logic , Maduro is no longer Venezuela \u2019 s president .\nSince opposition leader Juan Guaido declared himself president of Venezuela in January 2019 , the US and its allies have not recognized the Maduro government , even though he still holds power in Caracas .\nAs Barr put it , \u201c We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Venezuela .\nObviously , we indicted Noriega under similar circumstances , we did not recognize Noriega as the president of Panama.\n\u201d Maduro has always been in the crosshairs of the Trump administration , and this indictment is just another transparent effort of US regime change in the South American country .\nThe allegation against Maduro is that he works with Colombia \u2019 s rebel FARC group to smuggle cocaine through Venezuela that eventually reaches the US .\nAccording to Barr , the route the cocaine takes is either on boats through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Honduras .\nA closer look at where the cocaine in the US comes from shows the vast majority does not pass through Venezuela .\nA report released by the Washington Office for Latin America ( WOLA ) earlier in March debunked the myth spread by Washington that Venezuela is a top narco-state .\nUsing the US government \u2019 s own numbers , the WOLA report found that in 2017 only 7 percent of the cocaine that came to the US moved through Venezuela \u2019 s Eastern Caribbean waters .\nThe vast majority , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pacific .\nBarr estimates around 200 to 250 metric tons of cocaine transits through Venezuela per year .\nAccording to the numbers in the WOLA report , 210 metric tons passed through Venezuela in 2018 .\nBy comparison , Guatemala had over 1,400 metric tons pass through it that same year .\nBoth Venezuela and Guatemala are known as \u201c transit countries , \u201d meaning they do not produce cocaine , it only transits through .\nColombia , the world \u2019 s top producer of cocaine , had about 2,400 metric tons moved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ numbers show that if the concern was drug trafficking and not regime change , the US has much bigger fish to fry than Nicolas Maduro if the allegations against him are even true .\nEconomic sanctions placed on Venezuela by the Trump administration make it near impossible for the country to sell its oil , Venezuela \u2019 s greatest natural resource .\nIf Maduro really was the corrupt \u201c narco-terrorist \u201d the US claims he is , wouldn \u2019 t sanctioning the oil sector make him more reliant on drug money and increase @ @ @ @ @ @ @ oil sanctions started in 2017 , the flow of cocaine through Venezuela has actually decreased .\nThe Center for Economic Policy and Research ( CEPR ) released a report in April 2019 that found US sanctions on Venezuela were responsible for 40,000 deaths in the country .\nExperts believe the updated number is now around 100,000 since the crippling sanctions are still in effect .\nThe CEPR report explains how sanctions impact Venezuela \u2019 s medical supplies , and with the country now facing a possible coronavirus outbreak , those sanctions will only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Maduro in the midst of a global pandemic shows the world that US imperialism never shows mercy .\nRealistically , a US invasion of Venezuela to arrest Maduro is unlikely .\nThe task would prove much more difficult than the invasion of Panama .\nVenezuela is much bigger and is lacking the US military presence Panama had in the 80s .\nThe military has stayed loyal to Maduro , and Venezuela \u2019 s civilian militia has over three million members .\nMaduro has called for the creation of an \u201c Anti-Imperialist School \u201d @ @ @ @ @ @ @ professionals.\n\u201d Anti-imperialism is a key tenant of Maduro \u2019 s rhetoric , and Hugo Chavez \u2019 s before him , the Trump administration \u2019 s Venezuela policy has done nothing but play into this narrative .\nBut the fact is , there is a president in the White House who has not taken the military option to remove Maduro off the table .\nAnd the Attorney General believes the president has the right to invade a sovereign nation to arrest its leader without Congressional approval , even if it is
