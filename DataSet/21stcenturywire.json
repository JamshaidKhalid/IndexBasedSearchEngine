model , an inadequate and dwindling BI payment is provided that absolves low wage employers from the obligation of paying living wages and becomes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in place .\nYou become a customer shopping in a market place of privatized services .\nWho could really deny that this right wing version is much closer to presently unfolding reality than the hopes and dreams of left BI enthusiasts ?\n\u201d \u201c Basic Income , when all is said and done , is a vision for nothing more than the means to be a customer in an unjust society that decides what is for sale.\n\u201d \u201c It \u2019 s really about the commodification of social provision .\nYour payment may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but , as you shop through the privatized remains of the social infrastructure , with inadequate means and very few rights , you are dramatically worse off\u2026 \u2026 it is sometimes asserted that an adequate system of provision must be put in place simply because we are moving toward a \u201c workless future.\n\u201d In such a society , it is suggested , masses of people who have been displaced will have to be provided for and the capitalists will have to think like Elon Musk , of Tesla Motors and support BI @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rational solution .\nTo imagine such responsible provision for the future is to place undue faith in a system based on the making of profit .\nIf they won \u2019 t stop building pipelines in the face of environmental catastrophe , there \u2019 s little reason to expect them to worry too much about sensible solutions to technological displacement .\nThere simply is no post-capitalist capitalism and no social policy innovation that is going to bring it about\u2026 I am suggesting that our movements need to challenge , rather than come to terms @ @ @ @ @ @ @ capitalist system that has produced it .\nFor all its claims to be a sweeping measure , the notion of progressive BI is a futile attempt to make peace with that system .\nIn reality , even that compromise is not available .\nThe model of BI that governments are working on in their social policy laboratories will not \u2018 end the tyranny of the labour market \u2019 but render it more

Indonesian Capital in Borneo: From Rural Misery to Grody Dreams of Urban Glory", "content": "Indonesia \u2019 s new shining city of the hill ( Image : Andre Vltchek \u00a9 2020 ) An old road between Balikpapan and Samarinda passes through the poor villages , through rural slums , as well as stalls selling second-rate local fruits .\nThe cheap , unhygienic eateries , are now half-empty .\nWhile the traffic is still heavy here , the \u2018 real action \u2019 is somewhere else ; a few kilometers away , where the new motorway is being constructed ; a motorway which will , eventually , connect Balikpapan , Samarinda and potentially the new Indonesian capital @ @ @ @ @ @ @ around the now dirt poor Sepaku Village , in the area of Penajam Paser Utara .\nThe government of President Joko Widodo ( known as Jokowi ) is promising that the new capital will touch the skies , eclipsing places like Brasilia , Malaysian Putra Jaya , or Canberra .\nNothing short of Dubai or Manhattan , in the middle of the logged out , monstrously scarred , poisoned island of Borneo , known as \u201c Kalimantan \u201d in Indonesia .\nWhile virtually all Indonesian cities could easily be defined as urbanistic disasters @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be totally different , boasting green wide avenues and impressive architectural masterpieces that would be envied by the entire world .\nIndonesia has already made one such an attempt in its recent history \u2013 it promised to convert its island of Batam which is located just a stone \u2019 s throw from Singapore \u2013 into something much more impressive than Singapore itself ( a city-state with one of the highest quality of life on Earth ) .\nTwo years ago , I travelled to Batam , where I discovered a grotesque , bitter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of my previous essays entitled , \u201c Batam Island \u2013 Indonesia \u2019 s Sorry Attempt to Create Second Singapore \u201d .\nThe island had been thoroughly destroyed .\nNothing public was left , and nothing , absolutely nothing was built for the people .\nPrecisely just as in all other parts of Indonesia .\nThe ugliness of the urban areas of Batam was unimaginable .\nCorruption was omnipresent .\nThe feeble attempt to turn the island into an industrial , productive area , collapsed .\nWhat survived , at least for some period @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gambling .\nEventually , the gambling \u2018 industry \u2019 collapsed , too .\nOnly prostitution , together with some sand exports to Singapore , prevailed .\nPresently , there is not one single city in Indonesia , which could be defined as livable .\nNot one .\nWhy would the new capital be any different ?\nWhy would Indonesian people believe the government , which has been known for lying , for building sand castles , and for many long decades of absolute ineptness ?\nThere is not one elegantly built sidewalk , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there , suddenly be , hundreds of kilometers of beautiful avenues and promenades in the middle of Borneo ?\nAll public places , in all the Indonesian cities , have been commercialized , privatized , or outright stolen .\nWhy would it be different now ?\nWhat is this talk about big parks , green areas ?\nEvery big project in Jakarta , Surabaya or Bandung begins like that : endless promises of \u201c city walks \u201d , of malls overflowing with green areas .\nIn the end : nothing !\nA concrete @ @ @ @ @ @ @ public whatsoever .\nMaritime cities lacking promenades , urban centers without public parks , concert halls , or first-rate museums .\nThere is no place on Earth like this : absolute extreme corruption , and spite for the people .\nSo , is there any reason why the new capital would change the entire culture of graft , or lack of productivity and imagination ?\nIt will be , after all , constructed by the same individuals , same developers , same companies and the same government , as in all other parts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ road on which we drive , most of the people live in poverty , or if international standards were to apply : in misery .\nAt Bukit Suharto ( Suharto Hill ) , a peripheral area of the planned new capital , Ms. Niah , an old woman living alone in her shack , selling traditional rice cakes for a living , is not hopeful about her future .\nHere , as elsewhere in Indonesia , governments have come and gone , dropping empty promises , leaving people with basically nothing , just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pasrah , which can be loosely translated as \u2018 submissive melancholy \u2019 .\nMs. Niah is not afraid to speak : \u201c I did not know about the plan to move the capital here , by the government .\nThey tell us nothing .\nWhat I know is that I have never felt the benefits of development carried out by the government .\nFor decades , there was no help that I \u2019 d receive .\nI don \u2019 t even get that subsidized rice delivery , which each and every poor Indonesian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ theory .\nI get nothing .\nOn the contrary , I actually feel disadvantaged by what is called development .\nSince the government built the toll road not far from here , the traffic of the vehicles on this road has been reduced , and as a result , my rice cakes do not sell.\n\u201d A few hundred meters away , Mr. Abdul Gani , a retired civil servant actually worries about his future .\nThe government may force him out of his home , if it felt that his land may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the new capital project .\n\u201c A few weeks ago , an officer came to the houses in our village to collect information on the ownership deeds for land , buildings and fields , without giving us a hint of what reasons the data collected is for .\nThen , there were rumors circulating in this area , that our land would be taken , confiscated by the government , because we do not have ownership certificates .\nEverything is vague for us .\nWe don \u2019 t know what to expect.\n\u201d @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Please be serious .\nNo , we don \u2019 t believe that the government could build a city like Dubai here.\n\u201d All along the road , we hardly encounter any native people of Borneo .\nThe entire area is now populated by so called trans-migrants \u2013 individuals and families that were injected here , mainly from Java , South Sulawesi and Bali , after the 1965 military coup orchestrated by the West and by the Indonesian right-wing elites and religious cadres .\nTrans-migrants have been historically placed along the important roads , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in fact fascist dictator Suharto considered Dayak native people of this island to be \u2018 Communist \u2019 , because of their traditional , communal culture and way of life .\nHe did not trust them .\nIn fact , he busied himself destroying their \u201c long houses \u201d , and their philosophy of life .\nTrans-migrants have also been playing an extremely important role in Borneo , which is one of the wealthiest , in terms of natural resources , islands on Earth : their increasing presence has guaranteed that the local people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unite and demand independence from the colonialist Java .\nThe entire island is now ruined as a result of Jakarta \u2019 s rule , as well as the \u201c trans-migration \u201d .\nIt has been devastated , burned , deforested , poisoned .\nOnce resembling paradise on earth , it is now scarred and humiliated .\nIts original inhabitants are subjugated , kept divided and badly informed , and uneducated on purpose .\nThen comes the new capital project .\nIn an unusually bold report , the Jakarta Globe wrote on December 18 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ revealed the names of numerous national and local politicians who would reap profits from the capital city relocation mega-project , including the brother of defense minister Prabowo Subianto , Hashim Djojohadikusumo , and the coordinating minister of maritime affairs and investment , Luhut Binsar Panjaitan .\nThe study , \u201c Who Is the New Capital City For ?\n\u201d was conducted by a coalition of civil organizations ; Mining Advocacy Network ( Jatam ) , the Indonesian Forum for Environment ( Walhi ) , Trend Asia and Forest Watch Indonesia , and took @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the oligarchic connections in the mega-project and its environmental and societal impacts .\nThe report revealed names of people who have assets and concessions in the extractive industries such as coal , palm oil and lumber as well as energy plants in the area of East Kalimantan where the new capital is going to be built .\nIt also suggested the project could be used as a smokescreen to brush off the corporations \u2019 dirt for the environmental damage they have done there .\nWithin the 180,000-hectare area for the new so-called smart @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forestry , palm oil , coal and property concessions .\nAround 158 of them are coal mines that have left at least 94 deadly-deep holes in the area\u2026 \u201d Indonesian girl phone in a typical village in the area \u2013 pollution and misery ( Image : Andre Vltchek \u00a9 2020 ) We met two leading researchers from the Institut Dayakologi ( \u201c Dayakology Institute \u201d ) , Richardus Giring and Julianto Makmur , in the city of Pontianak , West Kalimantan .\nMainly , we wanted to know , whether the relocation of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ harm the local people .\n\u201c Since the issue of relocation of the capital was endorsed by the Jokowi government , I have never come across any open and transparent analysis .\nAll the studies tend to show positive aspects , without considering the risks and negative impacts of the relocation ; ignoring the interests of the Kalimantan people .\nThere should be a serious study , analyzing what the relocation of the capital would do to the locals.\n\u201d \u201c Aside from seeing the relocation of the capital as a solution to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plan should also be seen from the perspective of the impacts on Kalimantan and its people .\nWe do not want this capital relocation to be a kind of escape from the problems that Jakarta is facing ; we don \u2019 t want to move those problems to Kalimantan.\n\u201d \u201c The ecological injustice and the destruction of the social structure of the people of Kalimantan have been occurring since a long time ago .\nConsistently , various government sectoral ( forestry , energy , etc . )\nhave only made Kalimantan an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forests or other natural resources .\nThe Kalimantan that we see today is a dreadful legacy of the past and present .\nAlthough there are still few areas of pristine tropical forests left on the island , they are only small remnants.\n\u201d Map showing relocation of the new Indonesian capital to the island of Borneo ( Map : Caitlin Dempsey using Natural Earth Quick Start ) Working all over the island , filming and writing about the dreadful situation , for years , we could only agree .\nAnd Mr. Giring continued @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of promising a big , beautiful and magnificent new capital , if it is not preceded by proper and careful planning and study ?\nSo far , what they have done is only feasibility studies based on positive predictions .\nNo studies on the risks , or on the negative impacts that may arise .\nIf it is not done carefully , the whole thing will definitely turn out to be a blunder .\nWe know that this is not just a plan : a lot of resources have already been spent .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ to anticipate beforehand what lies ahead ; to study risks , the environmental impacts.\n\u201d \u201c If not , people will have no sense of ownership .\nThe new capital will only belong to Jakarta \u2019 s elites , and to Jokowi .\nAnd in the end , it will only move the problems from Jakarta to Kalimantan .\nIt \u2019 s beginning to look like a beauty contest , where the important thing is how things look .\nAs long as they appear to look magnificent , great !\nShort video clips @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the mass media .\nBut it is irrelevant to the people of Borneo and for the entire Indonesia.\n\u201d \u201c I imagine that there will be many potential conflicts that will arise , such as land-grabbing caused by the politics of the state administration .\nThere will also be an exodus of people to the new capital which will certainly trigger conflict with local people.\n\u201d \u201c Well , this is our paradigm of development , which tends to sacrifice the interests of small people for the sake of the elites .\nOn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sacrificing the poor/small people .\nIn this case , they are being sacrificed solely for the sake of an \u2018 image or impression , \u2019 as if they were not human beings with dignity.\n\u201d .\nWhile the propaganda that is promoting the new capital is all over the Indonesian mass media , here in Kalimantan there is hardly any information , even about the precise location .\nThe area designated by Jokowi \u2019 s regime is enormous .\nEverything has been hushed up , camouflaged , covered in secrecy .\nWe ask @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go , but they are not sure .\nWe drive back and forth , frustrated and tired .\nOn the second day , we finally came to a security post .\nBehind , the enormous and devastated land can be seen .\nWe are told that it belongs to the retired General Prabowo Subianto , a man who ran against President Widodo in the last elections , in 2019 , and after being defeated , was elevated to the post of Minister of Defense of the Republic of Indonesia .\nA former Lieutenant-General @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of human rights , in the territories occupied by Java , and in Jakarta itself , where his troops were involved in kidnapping and torturing student protesters .\nSeveral security guards man the post .\nOne of them is called Hambali , a gate security officer employed by the company PT .\nITCI , which is owned by Prabowo Subianto himself .\nBehind the barrier and the post , there is the vast location of the planned city center of the new capital .\nAlthough in theory , this place is supposed to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us , the security personnel immediately go to work , asking us questions , checking IDs , making phone calls to some undisclosed locations .\nOur documents are photocopied .\n\u201c So , is this going to be an Indonesian Dubai ?\n\u201d We ask .\n\u201c Or perhaps Manhattan

sure that the new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or Manhattan.\n\u201d The Grandeur : entrance to the new Indonesia capital site ( Image : Andre Vltchek \u00a9 2020 ) Pay as You Go : A new privately owned toll road ( Image : Andre Vltchek \u00a9 2020 ) What follows is a nightmare , combined with Kafkaesque , grotesque images .\nIndonesia always manages to surprise , and to shock me .\nFirst , on the road shoulder , there are several broken trucks , full of timber .\nThe drivers and helpers are busy fixing their engines and tires .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ Indiscriminate logging is obviously going on , up to now .\nOur car moves on ; begins climbing the rolling hills .\nThe devastation is appalling , even by the standards of Borneo/ Kalimantan .\nEntire hills have been deforested , scarred .\nHuge , monstrous stubs of enormous trees line up the road .\nThere are all sorts of makeshift \u2018 reforestation \u2019 projects , obviously conducted to impress the local media .\nThe result of all this is terrifying .\nThe higher we get , the greater the scale of destruction @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can be seen for tens of kilometers , in every direction .\nIf this was once , decades and centuries ago , a paradise , it is now hell .\nOn top of all this , stands a small metal structure , called Sudarmono Tower , put together in the most amateurish manner .\nIt is supposed to resemble the Eiffel Tower .\nLocal people drive here ; they climb it ; adults , children , even grandmothers .\nThere is nothing else to do , in this part of the world : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plantations , mines and other commercial ventures .\nNow they have new entertainment \u2013 me .\nThey stare , point fingers , repeating , as they always do when they see a foreigner : \u201c bule , bule \u201d ( derogatory for \u201c albino \u201d ) .\nLe Tower de Kalimantan Nouveau \u2013 at the very center of the new capital ( Image : Andre Vltchek \u00a9 2020 ) We approached Ms. Imah , who was visiting the tower together with her family .\nShe is from Sepaku Dua .\nShe has no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u2018 colonizing and then plundering \u2019 of Kalimantan .\nIf anything , she is one of the \u2018 colonizers \u2019 , but definitely not one of those who improved their lives by moving to the island .\nShe knows nothing about the \u2018 grand plan \u2019 .\nOr , she knows very little .\nAll she worries about are insignificant details : noise and possible overcrowding : \u201c This is my first time visiting the location of the planned center of the capital .\nPersonally , I am worried about the relocation of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Now , we live in a quiet and peaceful environment .\nI am sure there will be more and more people coming and it will become crowded.\n\u201d She does not know that she is living in thorough misery .\nAlmost nobody around here , or even in the middle of the monstrous Jakarta and Surabaya slums , realize their conditions .\n\u2018 Quiet and peaceful \u2019 , she describes her environment .\nWooden shacks , a medical and education system near the hard sub-Saharan African bottom , an entire island robbed , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ land ( yes , you are reading correctly ) sold to private businesses .\nMs Ponadi , a shop owner , from Sepaku Village , thinks only about the possible compensation .\nBut she is not even sure that the compensation will be provided by the government : \u201c We came to this village decades ago , as trans-migrants , who started a new life from scratch .\nNow I already have enough land to pass on to my daughters and sons .\nHonestly , I would not be willing if we were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nIf we had to move , the government would have to provide adequate compensation , for the hard-earned lives we have built here for decades.\n\u201d This land she is talking about used to belong to this island , and to the people of this island .\nBut she does not understand .\nFirst , the fascist government sent them here , to spread their culture and religion , all around this island , which used to be inhabited by enormous , advanced and clearly socialist cultures .\nNow , the Javanese @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u2018 investment \u2019 .\nMs. Ponadi concludes , somehow sarcastically : \u201c How could they possibly be able to build a city like Dubai here ?\nI am not convinced at all .\nTall buildings will immediately collapse to the ground \u201d .\nShe laughs , loudly .\nWe don \u2019 t .\nAll this is not funny .\nIt is , somehow , damn serious .\nWe drive through Borneo , exhausted , depressed , and with the feeling that something terrible is once again taking place here .\nFor almost three @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to people , all over this tremendous island , the 3rd largest on Earth , after Greenland and Papua .\nWe have been documenting mighty rivers like Kapuas , now poisoned by mercury , hills leveled to the ground by mining companies , tremendous sprawls of land deforested , and converted into palm oil plantations .\nChemicals , black carcinogenic creeks , and filth , are everywhere .\nCoal barges exporting the bowels of the island to all corners of the world .\nVillages and towns surrounded by monstrous commercial enterprises .\nBeaches @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nChildren playing in the middle of the roads .\nSick people running , escaping to the Malaysian part of the island , where the medical care is much better and cheaper .\nFor almost three years , we have been collecting material for a huge documentary film , and a book .\nThe world knows nothing about Borneo ; or almost nothing .\nYet , its demise is as important as that of Amazonia .\nAnd the destruction is much more rapid here , than anything recorded in Brazil .\nOur nerves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ big insanity , and we are alone , totally alone in this : no support and no backing .\nAnd this huge , enormous country all around us , choking us .\nThe Fourth most populous nation on Earth , totally indoctrinated by the pro-Western , pro-business regime , with hardly any diversity , with no mercy , no production and hardly any enthusiasm .\nA country that only consumes , and which lives off cutting down trees , polluting rivers and selling its riches to multi-national companies .\n\u201c I do not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , because I prefer the forest to be sustainable .\nEven now they are already destroyed , so what would the forests look like if they really move the capital ?\nKalimantan Island would be more devastated .\nAnd once it gets more devastated , they will move again .\nThat is ridiculous.\n\u201d Yes , they always move again .\nThey come like locust , from Java , supported by Western , foreign , companies .\nThey stay for as long as there is something to plunder .\nThen , they move @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not produce , it only plunders , and buys toys for the rich , after selling the loot .\nIt is a terribly frightening sight .\nEverything is make-believe : statistics lie , planners lie .\nThe country has been ransacked , by less than 1 % of the population .\nDeforestation and desolation marks the new center of the future capital city ( Image : Andre Vltchek \u00a9 2020 ) Rainforests are still being clear cut , with no end in sight ( Image : Andre Vltchek \u00a9 2020 )

Blair.\n\u201d Jokowi says he loves business , and he is enamored with the U.S. president Donald Trump .\nHe can hardly believe that from a furniture seller he has gone \u2018 so far \u2019 , meeting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , shaking their hands , telling them how much they are wanted in Indonesia .\nHe talks big .\nHe shuts up his critics .\nJournalists and activists are disappearing , or outrightly getting murdered .\nLaws muzzling any criticism are being introduced , gradually and consistently .\nNobody dares to guess what may come next .\nNew Order ( \u201c Ode Baru \u201d ) \u2013 the fascist pro-business regime of General Suharto , is being re-introduced .\nIn this political climate ; in a climate of fear , intimidation and corruption , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expected to rise .\nAs we sit in a car , in silence , driving towards Balikpapan City , my left eye begins to ache .\nIt is just the beginning of a horror which I will have to face in just two weeks from now .\nMy stomach has been

citizens to pray and drink herbal medicine .\nIn such a situation , a tremendous amount of people may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Indonesia , unreported .\nBut now we slowly progressed towards the main regional center , and its airport .\nAhead of us , there will be a horrid flight to Pontianak , in two days , on a filthy and overcrowded Boeing 737 , so filthy that it resembles an old bus in some collapsed country .\nThen , a flight to Jakarta on the national carrier Garuda Indonesia , where several people sat around us would be emitting dry , persistent coughs .\nUnlike in the Philippines , Vietnam and of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no medical checkpoints , until much , much later .\nIndonesia is a collapsed country .\nI depicted it in my documentary film \u201c DOWNFALL !\n\u201d The fact that it has crumbled is a well-hidden secret .\nIf it does something really well , it obstructs the truth , tricking its own citizens and the world .\nIt shows its true face only when emergencies strike , as basically nothing works there : rescue operations , the medical system , or transportation .\nIndonesia : with such workers \u2013 good luck building @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Vltchek \u00a9 2020 ) Before leaving Balikpapan , we talked to several individuals there .\nAlthough in Indonesia , more than half of the population lives in misery ( if international statistics were to apply ) , people here apply standardized neocon \u201c logic \u201d .\nEven in the slums , all over the archipelago , people use stock market jargon .\nIt looks unnatural , terrifying , perverse .\nLusi ( known , like most people in Indonesia , by only one name ) , a housewife , a visitor to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ offered her \u201c analyses \u201d : \u201c I agree and support the relocation of the capital .\nIt will boost economic development , especially in the property businesses.\n\u201d Would she , personally , participate in the \u201c economic development and property business \u201d ?\nWhen asked , she did not know what to say .\nMr. Arip Harahap , a senior architect , based in Jakarta , declared for this report , that moving the capital from Jakarta to Kalimantan , is \u201c immoral \u201d .\nHe elaborated : \u201c First , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ planning and design process .\nAll technical , socio-cultural studies are still too shallow .\nSecond , considering the country \u2019 s economic situation , it is such a wasteful way of spending a budget .\nThird , it seems that there are the interests of groups close to the central government that will benefit from the project.\n\u201d Apparently , there are many such interests , of many groups close to the government .\nAs the government and such groups are intertwined , forming one system , a regime , which has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the nation .\n\u201c The corporations and the oligarchs have a chance to ensure their investments are safe with this project .\nMeanwhile , they ignore the fact the indigenous Paser Balik tribe had their land taken away by ITCI Hutan Manunggal in the 1960s , \u201d Jatam coordinator Merah Johansyah said at the report \u2019 s launch in Jakarta on Tuesday .\nThe names mentioned in the report include lumber businessman Sukanto Tanoto , the owner of ITCI Hutan Manuggal ; Hashim Djojohadikusumo , Prabowo \u2019 s younger brother ; Rheza Herwindo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ex-House speaker Setya Novanto ; Thomas Aquinas Djiwandono , the treasurer of the Gerindra Party and Prabowo \u2019 s nephew ; lawyer and ex-Justice Minister Yusril Ihza Mahendra ; and the ubiquitous Luhut .\nPresident Joko \u201c Jokowi \u201d Widodo announced the location of the new capital city , at Penajam Paser Utara in East Kalimantan , on April 29 , only 12 days after he won the presidential election .\n\u201c The government never asked for approval from the people of East Kalimantan .\nThe decision [ to move the capital there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ presidential election without consulting the public .\nThat was a crime as far as public participation in politics is concerned , \u201d Merah said.\n\u201d Investigating oppression against the indigenous people in Indonesia , as well as the destruction of the environment all over the archipelago by the collusion of local oligarchs , foreign multi-nationals and Indonesian government , is an extremely dangerous job , particularly now , under Jokowi \u2019 s administration .\nPeople get hunted down , killed , arrested and in the case of foreigners , regularly deported .\nRecently @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arrested and imprisoned in Palangkaraya , Central Kalimantan , after attending meetings of the indigenous people of Kalimantan , and reporting for Mongabay .\nThe Environmental science website , Mongabay , is an outspoken publication , that is persistently critical of the situation in Indonesia .\nRegarding the new capital , it reported on 6 January , 2020 : \u201c The site of the new capital on the island of Borneo is home to 162 existing concessions , most of them for coal mining , according to a report from a coalition of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ s claim that the city will be built on vacant land , and raises the prospect of the concession-holders exploiting the opportunity for profit , said Merah Johansyah from the Mining Advocacy Network ( Jatam ) , one of the NGOs in the coalition .\n\u201c If the government says it \u2019 s going to be the public who will benefit [ from relocating the capital ] , that \u2019 s a big lie , \u201d he said at the launch of the report in Jakarta .\n\u201c The ones that will benefit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but TV is always there ( Image : Andre Vltchek \u00a9 2020 ) And so , the story goes .\nSix decades of attempts to move the Indonesian capital , from Jakarta to Kalimantan on the island of Borneo .\nFirst , the enthusiastic effort by President Sukarno , to raise the socialist , Soviet-style city of Palangkaraya in Central Kalimantan , literally in the middle of nowhere .\nThen , the U.S.-backed fascist coup put a full stop to all the progressive aspirations and people-oriented development .\nRecently , after getting re-elected @ @ @ @ @ @ @ abandon the polluted , embarrassingly poor and \u2018 sinking \u2019 Jakarta , and move the capital city to Penajam Paser Utara in East Kalimantan .\nUnlike the left-wing vision of Sukarno , Jokowi \u2019 s design is nihilistic , and if implemented , it will benefit only big business and the oligarchs .\nThe great majority of the Indonesian people will gain absolutely nothing .\nThe great migration of morally and economically corrupt bureaucrats and their butlers from Jakarta to East Kalimantan , would further damage the already extremely devastated island .\nNative @ @ @ @ @ @ @ marginalized and oppressed .\nIf this happens , there will also be very little chance for them to ever regain control of their own island .\nContainer ships ready to take away loot from Kalimantan , to richer waters ( Image : Andre Vltchek \u00a9 2020 ) As this report is being written , the Indonesian economy is collapsing , due to the COVID-19 epidemy .\nEven before the lockdowns , the commodity-based economy of the fourth most populous nation was not doing well .\nNow the situation is truly shattering now .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ totally incorrect .\nIn reality , the majority of the nation lives below international poverty lines , living in urban and rural slums , lacking basic sanitation , access to clean water , decent medical care , healthy and nutritious food , education and housing .\nCan Indonesia afford to waste 33 billion dollars on moving its capital city ?\nAnd everyone knows that 33 billion will at some point inflate to 50 billion , then perhaps to one trillion , until we will all lose count .\nIf the project goes ahead @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yet another re-distribution of the national wealth \u2013 delivering billions of dollars into the hands of very few corrupt oligarchs and so-called \u201c elites \u201d .\nThe \u2018 project \u2019 should stop .\nIt has to stop , but can it still be stopped ?\nIn Indonesia , the greed of the rulers is much greater than logic .\nMost of the citizens are uninformed , lethargic and submissive .\nPeople are resigned .\nWill the new capital ever get built ?\nSo far , there is only the tiny fake Eiffel Tower @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by plundered nature .\nAlmost nothing moves .\nThere is almost total silence there , as if it were the silence

100 percent mortality rate.\n\u201d The current \u201c pandemic \u201d can be used to illustrate societal problems more destructive than disease .\nHow Americans view the role of government in their lives and their belief that government can fix anything , including their mortality , demonstrates the madness that inflicts people when they become impressed with some delusion and run after it .\nThe present response to the coronavirus has led to panic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reactions .\nActing upon incomplete and probably inaccurate information , our government has embarked upon a spending spree and encroachment on the liberties of Americans of massive proportions .\nLogic would dictate that from now on , every flu season , our economy must shut down and the government print , thereby inflating , more money and spend it on non-productive transfers .\nThe sphere of liberty shrinks as the size of government grows .\nThe current response to \u201c Chinese flu \u201d has led to policies unheard of in American history with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that government can cure anything ( pun intended ) , they are exhibiting symptoms of a disease far more serious than COVID-19 .\nIn slightly more than 200 years , Americans have moved away from self-reliance toward government dependence .\nOur history has been one of people demanding and expecting the government to leave them alone .\nNow , people are requiring the government to take care of them .\nBut at what cost ?\nBeing told that 1 million Montanans are under \u201c house arrest \u201d and that every \u201c non-essential \u201d @ @ @ @ @ @ @ irrational response to save the lives of a few .\nThe logic displayed during this current \u201c pandemic \u201d would necessitate that nothing ever be allowed that would put more than 1 percent of a given population at risk .\nSo , driving cars must be banned , no American lives can be risked defending freedom , and high cholesterol foods taken off the shelves .\nThe assumption that the government can and should take care of your needs is a subtle destroyer of the American spirit .\nSuch a childlike attitude changes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ erodes the resilience of people to deal with a crisis .\nWho will rescue us from our rescuers ?\nWe did not vote on the \u201c shelter-in-place \u201d dictum .\nWe did not vote on the shut down of all \u201c non-essential \u201d businesses .\nHysteria leads to a dismissal of the factual .\nAnd the factual analysis of this current \u201c Wuhan flu \u201d is that many of the policies enacted here in Montana are irrational and insulting .\nDoes anyone believe that the \u201c vulnerable \u201d ( such as this mid-70s @ @ @ @ @ @ @ appropriate precautions on their own without the governor destroying the livelihoods of all our fellow Montanans ?\nDoes anyone really expect now that a governor has assumed the power to decide who is essential or not , that future governors will not expand on such policies ?\nIncreasing dependence on government and passively accepting that some \u201c elite \u201d somewhere knows best about our welfare is much more dangerous than the Wuhan virus .\nThe natural desire to be \u201c safe \u201d often

the evidence indicates that this latest breaking \u2018 bombshell \u2019 is nothing but a convenient distraction to help obscure a series of western propaganda failures of recent .\nThe latest episode of the RussiaGate saga has to do with a supposed \u201c fresh leak \u201d of documents from data trawling and political consulting firm , Cambridge Analytica , which features some 100,000 documents said to expose its dodgy dealings in 68 countries , and claiming to show \u2018 global electoral manipulation \u2019 on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you thought the epic RussiaGate fantasy fiction series was nearly dead and on life-support , the British Establishment reiterate their push by recycling tried and tested media operatives .\nCarole Cadwalladr , a journalist for the Observer , the Guardian \u2019 s sister paper , whose exposure of Cambridge Analytica \u2019 s misappropriation of 87 million Facebook profiles brought the company down in 2018 , is making these claims after a raft of documents from Brittany Kaiser , an ex-Cambridge Analytica employee turned whistleblower , began to appear on an anonymous Twitter account @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The leaks from the now-defunct data firm are supposedly \u2018 explosive.\n\u2019 They contain material on elections in Malaysia , Kenya and Brazil .\nApparently , they expose the inner workings of the data company and lay bare the global infrastructure of voter manipulation .\nThe documents retrieved from Kaiser \u2019 s email accounts and hard drives , are only the start of thousands more to come .\nAccording to Kaiser , these reveal the true depth of the sinister data firm \u2019 s operation that go \u2018 way beyond what people think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scandal.\n\u2019 Well , if there is one thing we definitely do know about the Cambridge Analytica scandal , it is that there has not been one piece of evidence to show how the firm used Facebook data to manipulate voters in the Trump election or during the Brexit referendum .\nTo this day , no one can show who was targeted .\nWith what ads ?\nIn what locations ?\nThere is no clear picture what Cambridge Analytica did for Trump .\nOr what it did in any of the dozens of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on .\nAs it turns out , Russiagate promoter and Integrity Initiative-linked Carole Cadwalladr is being sued for libel by prominent Brexit campaigner Aaron Banks over defamatory statements made by Cadwalladr claiming the Banks was somehow involved with the Russians in orchestrating Brexit \u2013 despite providing any actual evidence to back-up her popular mainstream conspiracy theory .\nIn December , a judge issued a preliminary ruling in a libel case brought by Banks against Cadwalladr .\nAccording to the complaint , she attempted to defame Banks publicly on multiple occasions by repeatedly making @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the Russian government offered money to Arron Banks , \u201d and , \u201c And I am not even going to go into the lies that Arron Banks has told about his covert relationship with the Russian government , \u201d and , \u201c I say he lied about his contact with the Russian government .\nBecause he did.\n\u201d Not surprisingly , the mainstream media establishment has showered Cadwalladr with journalism awards for her supposed \u2018 coverage \u2019 of heavily amplified but still unproven Russiagate conspiracies .\nIf that \u2019 s not shocking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dusted-off than the world \u2019 s most discredited \u2018 intelligence \u2019 operative , he of Dossier fame , Christopher Steele , to try to buttress Cadwalladr \u2019 s shaky Russia conspiracies .\nSteele is , if anything , resilient .\nDr. Lewis adds here : This \u2018 infrastructure of subversion \u2019 on an industrial scale is a chimera of innuendo , paranoia , and wild assertions with no evidence that it manipulates anyone , that is , apart from the gullible political parties who have paid millions on the very stupid idea that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nBut who needs facts ?\nCertainly not someone like Christopher Steele , the ex-head of MI6 \u2019 s Russia desk and the intelligence expert behind the so-called \u2018 Steele dossier \u2019 into Trump \u2019 s relationship with Russia .\nYou remember how well that went ?\nIn a rare public intervention to comment on the leaks , he admitted without any sense of self-awareness , that he had not seen the documents and thus did not know what was in them .\nBut he was apparently certain , as reported by Cadwalladr @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to get worse , not better , and with crucial 2020 elections in America and elsewhere approaching , this is a very scary prospect .\nSomething radical needs to be done about it , and fast.\n\u2019 In the end , most of output emanating from members and associates of the British government-funded Integrity Initiative anti-Russian propaganda \u2018 clusters \u2019 serve to create a convenient smokescreen for real scandals which the Establishment seem ever-desperate to obscure , namely , that it is western state agencies who are actively meddling in otherS , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ explains : In the weird conspiracy-sphere , facts are unimportant ; denial is proof .\nThe more one denies a baseless claim , the more it proves there is something to hide .\nCase closed .\nThe truth is much simpler .\nFacebook are protecting this data precisely because if the truth were to come out \u2013 that the millions of dollars political parties spend on their platform during elections do very little to affect the outcome \u2013 this would seriously impact their business model .\nThis is business , not politics .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ clear that Carole Cadwalladr isn \u2019 t actually doing journalism here , but rather just cobbling together a string of heavily aired logical fallacies , all glued together with xenophobic fear mongering about an alleged Russian take-over of the West .\nHer original Brexit thesis appears to have been predicated on the a tenuous theory that there was a \u2018 unusual swing of opinion from Remain to Leave \u2019 during the EU referendum in 2016 , and further claiming this was evidence that Brexit advertising worked , and that the Russians were behind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a series of amateur assumptions long since debunked by astute commentators like Craig Murray and others .\nIt is only because these fabricated theories from Cadwalladr and Steele help to fill in the geopolitical narrative gaps for NATO member states \u2013 that they are given top billing and unearned credence is itself a sad fact which speaks to the institutional corruption of western governments and our mainstream media organisations in the 21st century .", "author": "21wire", "url":

"title": "Awaiting the Mahdi: Soleimani\u2019s Martyrdom and the End of Stupidistan", "content": "On Friday morning ( 3 January 2020 ) , Iraq \u2019 s capital was awakened by a big blast , an aerial attack hitting a convoy of vehicles leaving Baghdad airport and killing the deputy chief of the \u1e24ashd ash-Sha\u02bfb\u012b ( or Popular Mobilization Units , PMU ) Abu Mahdi al-Muhandis and four more PMU members , in addition to a lone Iranian dignitary .\nThe PMU spokesman Ahmed al-Assadi subsequently released this statement : \u201c The American and Israeli enemy is responsible for killing the mujahideen Abu Mahdi al-Muhandis and Qassem Soleimani , \u201d identifying the lone Iranian dignitary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Force , while giving less prominence to the equally dead four anonymous fighters .\nNow , the United States has assassinated the Iranian General Qassem Soleimani , in another example of President Trump doing better what Obama did well , namely utilising a precision drone strike eliminating Washington \u2019 s perceived opponents , this time hitting a convoy of vehicles killing two notorious military leaders and four of their fighters \u2013 President Obama \u2019 s most notorious precision drone strike arguably was the elimination of Anwar al-Awlaki \u2019 s teenage son on 14 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ s predecessor also supervised a whopping \u201c total of 563 strikes \u201d during his two terms , obliterating his own predecessor \u2019 s record .\nIn 2017 , the Bureau of Investigative Journalism \u2019 s Jessica Purkiss and Jack Serle remarked in an off-hand manner that there \u201c were ten times more air strikes in the covert war on terror during President Barack Obama \u2019 s presidency than under his predecessor , George W. Bush.\n\u201d Whereas Trump , authorised a total of 238 drone strikes already during the first two years of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Iraq and Syria.\n\u201d Last year , the columnist S.E .\nCupp , rather poignantly , remarked that the \u201c Obama administration paved the way for popularizing and normalizing drone wars.\n\u201d And as a good U.S. President , Donald Trump all but continues this trendy fashion of raining death from above , while decrying Obama \u2019 s weakness and undoing his achievements ( most notably in this context , the Iran nuclear deal , meaning the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action or JCPOA ) , and practising his defiant strategy which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u201d back in 2017 .\nIn the same fashion , Trump \u2019 s televised announcement of Soleimani \u2019 s public execution was reminiscent of his predecessors \u2019 performance after the successful killing of Osama bin Laden in Abbotabad ( 2 May 2011 ) .\nThough Trump did not know who Soleimani was back in 2015 , apparently even confusing the Quds Force with the Kurds , addressing the nation on television in 2019 , he described the now dead Iranian as \u201c the number-one terrorist anywhere in the world , Qasem Soleimani.\n\u201d @ @ @ @ @ @ @ decisive call to action thwarted \u201c imminent and sinister attacks on American diplomats and military personnel , \u201d that Soleimani had been \u201c caught .\n.\n.\nin the act.\n\u201d In fact , Trump asserted that \u201c [ f ] or years , the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps and its ruthless Quds Force \u2014 under Soleimani \u2019 s leadership \u2014 has targeted , injured , and murdered hundreds of American civilians and servicemen , \u201d even claiming that the \u201c recent attacks on U.S. targets in Iraq , including rocket strikes that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ servicemen very badly , as well as a violent assault on our embassy in Baghdad , were carried out at the direction of Soleimani.\n\u201d Donald Trump even alleged that his victim had actively contributed to \u201c terrorist plots as far away as New Delhi and London , \u201d in this way playing the role of a world leader , not just the Republican incumbent in the White House , but a man whose actions appear to take account of events shaping the world \u2013 even in places as far removed from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ England and India .\nAt the same time , Trump did not neglect to mention that Soleimani supposedly also \u201c targeted , injured , and murdered hundreds of American civilians and servicemen , \u201d as a reminder for his home audience that he is first and foremost the President of the United States , a nation that \u201c has the best military by far , anywhere in the world .\nWe have best intelligence in the world.\n\u201d Before finishing his address , Donald J. Trump did not forget to remind his audience @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Forces killed the terrorist leader known as al-Baghdadi , \u201d even more than insinuating that he personally had \u201c destroyed the ISIS territorial caliphate.\n\u201d This latest public relations stunt clearly deflects the American public \u2019 s attention from many things , including the ongoing impeachment trial that seems to upset Donald Trump quite a bit in spite of his nonchallant attitude towards Nancy Pelosi \u2019 s apparently quite ineffectual and counter-productive ploy .\nThe Raging Twenties : Heralding the End of America Trump has now really outdone Obama , killing two terrorist @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one .\nAnd while Obama \u2019 s announcement that Osama bin Laden had been killed took the world by surprise , Soleimani \u2019 s death really came as a bolt from the blue and has equally sent ripples throughout the world \u2013 even Kashmiri Shiite Muslims have now taken to the street to protest this wanton murder , even momentarily forgetting about India \u2019 s PM Modi and his desire to build a Hindutva nation-state on the sub-continent ( 3 January 2020 ) .\nThough the strike came totally unexpectedly , its timing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the heels of the storming of the U.S. Embassy compound in Baghdad \u2019 s Green Zone .\nInterestingly , it was the Guardian \u2018 s Luke Harding who weighed-in , putting it like this : \u201c Protesters in Iraq have dealt a symbolic blow to US prestige by storming the American embassy in Baghdad , trapping diplomats inside while chanting \u2018 Death to America \u2019 and slogans in support of pro-Iranian militias.\n\u201d Harding actually called this a \u201c humiliating day for Washington \u201d in Baghdad .\nRather than letting this take-over escalate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in 1980 , the Trump administration acted swiftly : \u201c Many US embassy staff were evacuated or airlifted from the compound , and an additional detachment of 100 US Marines were called in as reinforcements , along with an additional 750 troops from fast battalion 82nd Airborne Division sent to Kuwait preparing to go into Iraq .\nUS combat helicopters circled overhead , as well as around the entire Green Zone and over civilians neighborhoods in Baghdad .\nThis move was not received well by the Iraqi government who forbid such US military @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forces agreement for the country .\nThe siege lasted until News Years Eve on December 31st , before the Iraqi Army and Iraqi Mukhabarat internal security eventually arrived to disperse the angry crowds , \u201d as related by our very own 21st Century Wire \u2018 s Patrick Henningsen .\nApparently unable to countenance this \u201c humiliating day for Washington , \u201d thin-skinned Trump then authorised the drone strike on Soleimani ( as also hinted at in the President \u2019 s televised statement ) , in this way taking out the \u2018 2nd most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the dead general is now being universally described .\nBut , as officially the U.S. is not at war with either Iraq or Iran , this assassination really has all the hallmarks of a wanton act of terror .\nIran \u2019 s UN Ambassador Majid Takht Ravanchi published a written statement which calls Soleimani \u2019 s murder an \u201c obvious example of State terrorism and , as a criminal act , constitutes a gross violation of the fundamental principles of international law , including , in particular , those stipulated in the Charter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ context , the ever-colourful yet incisive and deeply insightful Pepe Escobar posted this \u201c Raging Twenties reminder \u201d on his Facebook page , namely that \u201c Stupidistan has declared war on Iran AND Iraq.\n\u201d And for all intents and purposes , Escobar is correct , albeit that the official narrative continues to spin alternative facts befitting the alternate reality we are now inhabiting in the Age of Trump , where the twenties that were \u2018 Roaring \u2019 in the 20th century , have become Raging and the United States of America has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u2018 Stupidistan.\n\u2019 In the U.S. , where much of the real world seems far away , Democratic politicians have now come out to complain about the fact that \u201c Congress wasn \u2019 t consulted.\n\u201d The soon-to-be octogenarian House Speaker Nancy Pelosi ( her birthday is on March , 26 ) even called the drone strike a \u201c provocative and disproportionate action.\n\u201d On the other hand , the intrepid Turkish journalist Hikmet Durgun tweets that , \u201c 4 minutes before the killing of Qassem Soleimani , the U.S. informed Iraq \u2019 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 5 Jan 2020 ) .\nBack in the U.S. then , Sleepy Joe aka Trump \u2019 s wanna-be rival former Vice President Joe Biden , has said some choice words now , hinting at the fact that his favourite opponent , the 45th U.S. President \u201c tossed a stick of dynamite into a tinderbox , \u201d thereby bringing the U.S. to \u201c the brink of a major conflict across the Middle East \u201d and arguably the rest of the world .\nThough Biden seems to have ignored the current political constellations , focusing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ traditional proxy-theatre for superpower conflicts , this high-tech assassination could arguably lead to a domino effect in the newly-formed network of alliances which I have termed \u201c New Cold War Realignments \u201d \u2013 pitting the U.S. and its NATO allies against Russia , China , Turkey and Iran .\nIn the last century , on 28 June 1914 to be precise , a terror act executed by the Serb Gavrilo Princip ( 1894-1918 ) led to the worldwide conflagration that became known as the Great War , and that we nowadays refer to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nPrincip \u2019 s decidedly low tech assassination of the Habsburg Archduke Franz Ferdinand ( 1863-1914 ) instigated the mobilisation of allies and alliances that in a short while led to the German invasion of Belgium , Luxembourg , and France ( 4 August 1914 ) and the subsequent all-out war that was to draw in the United States at the last moment ( 6 April 1917 ) .\nAnd that was eventually to lead to the current jumble of nation states populating Europe and the Middle East , in the wake of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) and the Treaty of Versailles ( 28 June 1919 ) .\nAt the moment , it would seem rather unlikely that Qassem Soleimani \u2019 s death from above would lead to such a globe-spanning conflict .\n.\n.\nas most commentators like to remind everybody that it is more likely that Tehran will execute a \u2018 asymmetric reaction , \u2019 hinting at the possibility that some kind of soft target within the U.S. orbit could fall victim to righteous Iranian outrage .\nThis case was convincingly made by Representative Tulsi Gabbard , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ president : \u201c It further escalates this tit for tat that \u2019 s going on and on and on , [ and that ] will elicit a very serious response from Iran , and [ pushes ] us deeper and deeper into this quagmire .\nAnd it really begs the question : For what ?\n\u201d Gabbard spoke these pregnant words on Fox & Friends ( 3 January 2020 ) , apparently one of Trump \u2019 s favourite television programmes .\nThe Hawaii Representative has made a dedicated following among people critical of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ American tradition of \u2018 endless wars , \u2019 which is also a favourite trope used by then candidate Trump when he was pitching himself to the American public in 2016 .\nOn the other hand , as a practising Hindu , Gabbard \u2019 s apparent ties to India \u2019 s strongman Modi and his Hindutva ideology have drawn the ire of her opponents dubious character , as forcefully argued by the activist and journalist Pieter Friedrich .\nBehind the Scenes : Bibi \u2019 s Intervention and the Return of the Mahdi President Trump @ @ @ @ @ @ @ view of the world and its affairs , has told journalists in Miami that \u201c [ w ] e took action [ Thursday ] night [ which corresponds to Friday morning in Iraq ] to stop a war .\nWe did not take action to start a war.\n\u201d Trump \u2019 s warped appreciation of reality makes him sound truly Orwellian in tone and voice .\nIn a apologistic fashion , the media company Bloomberg relates that the \u201c president \u2019 s decision to target the powerful head of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , following the death of an American contractor in a Dec 27 rocket attack by an Iranian-backed militia against an US base in Iraq.\n\u201d On 31 December 2019 , however , Secretary of State Pompeo had a phone call with Israel \u2019 s Netanyahu ( aka Bibi ) , tweeting subsequently that \u201c [ w ] e discussed U.S. defensive strikes in Iraq and Syria to counter Iran \u2019 s threats.\n\u201d This clearly indicates that the U.S. and Israel , or rather Trump and Bibi ( and/or their proxies ) , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ As a matter of fact , it would stand to reason that this U.S. President \u2019 s extreme hostility towards Iran really stems from his close ties to the currently beleaguered Israeli PM .\nFor Bibi has a bit of an obsession , an obsession called Iran : as long ago as 1997 , he made the following utterly amazing statement : \u201c Iran , unseen , unperturbed and undisturbed is building a formidable arsenal of ballistic missiles , actually ICBM \u2019 s ( Intercontinental Ballistic Missiles ) .\nStage One would reach @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reach Britain and Stage Three , believe it or not , they actually plan to reach the eastern seaboard of the United States , Manhattan .\nThis sounds fantastic but Iran wants to be a world power with a world ideology of fundamentalist domination , seeing the West as its great enemy .\nIt seeks to have weapons to back up that ideology and that is even more dangerous than Saddam because there is a fanaticism , an ideological fanaticism attached to the acquisition of these weapons.\n\u201d And ever since that time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to invade Iran \u2013 neither Bill Clinton , George W. Bush nor Barack Obama paid him any heed , but now his old friend Trump seems to have felt obliged .\nAs apparently confirmed by one of Pepe Escobar \u2019 s top sources : \u201c Israel set up the killing of General Qassem Soleimani to draw the United States into a war with Iran as with Iraq .\nThat is what this is all about.\n\u201d While on Twitter , the political scientist Professor Max Abrahms declared that the \u201c # SoleimaniAssassination wasn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nOf course , the White House can \u2019 t just come out and say that.\n\u201d And it seems , the Iranian authorities really do regard Soleimani \u2019 s murder as a crime deserving serious punishment , a punishment that might even conjure up truly eschatological dimensions involving war and violence on a grand scale , a scale that might portend the end of the world and the return of the \u2018 Hidden Iman \u2019 ( Muhammad Ibn al-Hasan ) as the \u2018 Mahdi , \u2019 which means \u2018 The Guided One @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Islam preceding the end of the world \u2013 an expectation that has a \u201c major ecclesiastical importance in Shia Islam.\n\u201d On Saturday , 4 January 2020 , the \u201c Red Flag of Hussein [ was raised ] over the Holy Dome of Jamkaran Mosque , in [ the Holy City of ] Qom , \u201d and as explained by Joaquin Flores , the Editor-in-Chief of Fort Russ News , the \u201c raising of the red flag gives a precise signal \u2013 it indicates that a major war is to come or is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is redolent with the full Shia imagery of martyrdom and reminiscent of the sacrifice of Imam Hussain , whose martyrdom at Karbala is annually remembered with festive and violent processions .\nGeneral Qassem Soleimani had been so revered that he was called the \u201c Living Martyr \u201d and now , Bibi via the good offices of his buddy Trump , has promoted the General to the lofty status of a dead martyr or Shahid \u2013 the souls of martyrs go straight to heaven where they sit down next to the Prophet Muhammad facing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Quran states : \u201c And those who are killed in the cause of Allah \u2013 never will He waste their deeds .\nHe will guide them and amend their condition And admit them to Paradise , which He has made known to them \u201d ( 47:4-6 ) .\nBut the unfurling of the Red Flag also has a direct and tactical aim , for it \u201c speaks of events yet to unfold in [ a ] short time , \u201d as explained by Flores .\nOn the day before the unfurling of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ told a crowd of fervent Evangelicals in Miami the following : \u201c I do really believe we have God on our side.\n\u201d In other words , we now seem to have arrived at a situation where both opponents appear to act in accordance with their deeply held beliefs rather than their appreciation of reality on the ground .\nIn case of Trump , the sincerity of his convictions might seem dubious , but his Vice President and a large section his base seem utterly convinced .\nAccording to some of his Christian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well be on Trump \u2019 s side , but an escalation would only usher in a domino effect involving allies and alliances in the current New Cold War Realignments possibly leading to a globe-spanning conflict and a \u2018 veritable \u2019 return of the Mahdi .\nOver the weekend ( 4-5 January 2020 ) , Qassem Soleimani \u2019 s mortal remains were dutifully transported , while numerous believers paid their respects , the funeral procession \u201c began at [ Baghdad ] \u2019 s Al Muthana Airport , then moved to the gate of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ though the streets , some mourners carried portraits of Soleimani while others held portraits of Iran \u2019 s Supreme Leader , Ayatollah Ali Khamenei .\nLater , the procession left for the Shia Muslim holy cities of Karbala and Najaf , \u201d reports the BBC .\nThe remains of the martyred Soleimani thus paid its respects to Shi \u2019 a Islam \u2019 s foundational martyrs , Imam Hussein and his father Imam Ali , respectively buried in either location .\nFrom there , the dead Soleimani was transported to Iran , with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ahvaz on Sunday ( 5 January 2020 ) , where \u201c [ t ] ens of thousands of black-clad mourners have filled the streets.\n\u201d From there , Iran \u2019 s leadership will have the remains take to the holy city of Mashhad as well as Tehran and the holy city of Qom on Monday [ 6 January 2010 ] for public mourning processions , then to his hometown of Kerman for burial on Tuesday [ 7 January 2020 ] .\n\u201d Alas , the Supreme Leader \u2019 s people did not anticipate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u2019 s turnout : massive crowds flooded the streets necessitating the cancellation of the Tehran ceremonies , in view of the \u201c glorious , intense and million-man presence of the revolutionary people of Mashhad , \u201d an official Iranian statement read .\nMeanwhile on the ground in Iraq and in cyberspace , as reported by The Telegraph \u2019 s Josie Ensor , a \u201c volley of missiles appeared to target the US \u2019 s embassy and one of its bases in Iraq on Saturday night , \u201d adding that a \u201c Katusya rocket @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the American mission in Baghdad , followed minutes later by a two rockets 40 miles away on al-Balad airbase , which houses US Air Force trainers.\n\u201d In fact , many more attacks occurred throughout the whole of Iraq in the wake of Soleiman \u2019 s violent and untimely death .\n.\n.\nMeanwhile , Trump has again taken to Twitter to issue threats in the face of an imminent Iranian reaction : \u201c Iran is talking very boldly about targeting certain USA assets as revenge for our ridding the world of their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ American , & badly wounded many others , not to mention all of the people he had killed over his lifetime , including recently .\n.\n.\n.\nhundreds of Iranian protesters .\nHe was already attacking our Embassy , and preparing for additional hits in other locations .\nIran has been nothing but problems for many years .\nLet this serve as a WARNING that if Iran strikes any Americans , or American assets , we have .\n.\n.\ntargeted 52 Iranian sites ( representing the 52 American hostages taken by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at a very high level & important to Iran & the Iranian culture , and those targets , and Iran itself , WILL BE HIT VERY FAST AND VERY HARD .\nThe USA wants no more threats !\n\u201d ( 11:52 pm .\n4 Jan 2020 ) .\nThrough it seems unlikely the President personally composed and tweeted this digital threat , Iran was not averse to reacting in kind , with Khamenei \u2019 s military adviser Hossein Dehghan telling CNN that the U.S. President \u2019 s tweets are \u201c ridiculous and absurd.\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Islamic Republic \u2019 s Information and Telecommunications Minister Mohammad Javad Azari-Jahromi simply stated that \u201c Trump is a \u2018 terrorist in a suit \u2019 .\n.\n.\n[ saying that the U.S. President is ] Like ISIS , like Hitler , Like Genghis !\n\u201d even adding that \u201c [ t ] hey all hate cultures \u201d ( 9:47 am .\n5 Jan 202 ) .\nThough Trump may now think that his reckless murder of the Quds Force leader shows him to be a better or stronger president that either Bush @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Iraq his apparent quiescence to Bibi \u2019 s incessant sounding of war drums has led Baghdad \u2019 s \u201c Parliament [ to ] pass a resolution to end the presence of all foreign troops in the country , \u201d as reported by TRT World .\nIs this perhaps the beginning Stupidistan \u2019 s retreat from the scene or will the current New Cold War Realignments lead to a

predictions for the coming year .\nIn last year \u2019 s Trends and Predictions for 2019 , we identified some prominent watershed moments in politics , international relations and technology , but as is continually the case these days \u2013 the pace of change keeps speeding up , offering even more twists and turns than seen in previous years .\nLooking back , 2019 was truly a Shake & Bake year , where everything was up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ both Robert Mueller \u2019 s failure and the Democrat \u2019 s Impeachment of Donald Trump , along with a few other near-miss predictions .\nFor this coming year , we \u2019 ll see some entirely new realities come into focus , as 2020 takes us out of the frying pan .\nSo here it is \u2013 the good , the bad , and the ugly for 2020\u2026 Impeachment Dies on the Vine \u2013 Before Christmas , House Speaker Nancy Pelosi basically kicked the can into the New Year \u2013 afraid to send the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the US Senate , as is standard procedure .\nOne has to assume this is because she knew that the Democrat \u2019 s case was so incredibly weak that it would die as soon as it hit the Senate review panel .\nAs it turns out , this has been one the worst own-goals in US political history , but those who have actually been following these developments with a sober eye are not at all surprised by what they are seeing .\nOf course , this will only help Trump in his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Trump Redux \u2013 All indications are that Trump will be the presumptive favorite to win re-election in 2020 .\nThe reasons are as follows : the Democratic field was bloated from the start , with some 25 candidates vying for a spot on the podium .\nThis has left many swing voters confused and uninspired for the most part , although there are significant pockets of excitement for runners like Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren , and somehow , for Joe Biden .\nBut the question is : will any of these Democrat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 2016 ?\nRight now the answer appears to be no , while Trump \u2019 s support base seems to be steadily growing .\nAdd to this the recent bounce in the polls received by Trump as a result of the Democrat \u2019 s disastrous Impeachment effort , and Trump seems to be the frontrunner ahead of the Democratic Primaries in 2020 .\nRegardless , this will still be a close election and the Democrats are still likely to carry the popular vote nationally , while Trump will take the electoral college again by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rust belt states , as well as in key swing states like Virginia .\nIf indeed Trump wins re-election , expect accusations of \u201c Russian interference \u201d and also expect angry Antifa mobs to set some American cities on fire , literally .\nHalf of America still hasn \u2019 t learned its lessons from 2016

and creating a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Add to this the bloated and discombobulated Democratic field , and the reality of more progressive young bloods coming in , like Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez , fighting for key ranking positions and challenging political dinosaurs like Joe Biden , Nancy Pelosi , Chuck Schumer \u2013 and you have a real power struggle for the \u201c soul of the party \u201d .\nEvery week , we see young leftists accusing old centerist Democrats of being in the pocket of Wall Street , and not being \u2018 pure \u2019 enough or progressive enough for impatient millennials @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , they may be right , but that still won \u2019 t bring the party any closer to victory in 2020 .\nThis is not unlike the Tea Party split experienced by Republicans after their disastrous 2008 election .\nAs a result , wide fractures are already occurring in the American political left , and within the party itself .\nUnder the surface , you already have bad blood between the Bernie Sanders base and the Democratic National Committee ( DNC ) for intentionally railroading Bernie \u2019 s Presidential run in 2016 in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of this tension will culminate at the Democratic Convention in July , where it is likely that there will be no clear majority winner going in \u2013 which means a second vote may go to the convention floor , which will likely trigger the dreaded Super Delegates \u2013 the very same party apparatchiks and establishment loyalists who screwed Sanders in 2016 .\nAnd here they are again , doing the exact same thing in 2020 .\nThis may result in the DNC offering up a nominee which did not earn a mandate during @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to ignite a bona fide civil war within the party .\nUnderneath all this though , is the fact that there \u2019 s very little left on the Left , due to the fact that , like Britain \u2019 s Labour Party under Blair , Democrats have been pulled so far to the political right thanks to arch neoliberalists Bill Clinton and Barack Obama .\nFrom a policy point of view , centrist Democrats are almost indistinguishable from mainline Republicans .\nNo wonder more voters are feeling uninspired .\nThis in-fighting and apathy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Democrats , as they face having their own Mitt Romney moment in 2020 .\nPolitics is the New Hollywood \u2013 This concept was coined by SUNDAY WIRE host Patrick Henningsen back in 2017 , and continues to sums up the truly perilous trajectory of pop culture in the West .\nOf course , Donald Trump , a former reality TV star , embodies the trend of \u201c Politics is the New Hollywood , \u201d and really made this a reality by hogging the width and breadth of mass media coverage , mostly by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the media to respond and react to his every move and machination , no matter how frivolous or vapid it might be .\nThe attention he \u2019 s getting is as much from his detractors as it is from his support \u2018 base \u2019 .\nNonetheless , this sort of obsessive attention is normally reserved for celebrities , and royals .\nOther Democrat politicians will also get this publicity bounce in 2020 .\nIn the Ukraine , new President Volodymyr Zelenski was a TV actor who played a \u2018 regular guy who became @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , this is completely predictable , as social media feeds are now dominated with A-Z list political celebrities .\nAnd that \u2019 s all we time-poor folks really have time to follow closely these days .\nSadly , this means that there are simply no eye balls left to gawk at Hollywood \u2019 s glitterati .\nBecause of social media \u2019 s 24/7 political news cycle , \u2018 A-listers \u2019 can no longer compete for hearts and minds with round-the-clock characters Trump , Bernie and Creepy Joe .\nNo one cares who Tom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Kim Kardashian is topless on anymore \u2013 unless there \u2019 s a political angle .\nOtherwise , celebrities will continue to sink into the detritus of the collective pop consciousness .\nSo get used to it .\nPolitics is the New Hollywood .\nIn 2020 , it \u2019 s definitely a thing .\nMass De-platforming and Censorship \u2013 2019 was a banner year for the nameless , faceless , Silicon Valley censorship committees , a self-appointed Star Chamber , busy programming their algorithms to exclude any speech online which these corporations believe falls @ @ @ @ @ @ @ public discourse .\nAll of this was initially launched in late 2016 under the guise of \u201c fighting fake news \u201d , which then morphed into \u201c countering disinformation \u201d , which now encompasses ever vague missions like \u201c countering Russian influence \u201d and cleansing the virtual world of \u201c extremist content \u201d .\nIn reality , all of this has been undertaken for partisan reasons ; Silicon Valley firms are overwhelmingly Democrat and liberal in their political orientation .\nThis orgy of corporate censorship is also being underwritten by new government censorship @ @ @ @ @ @ @ EU , all predicated on the excuse of fighting \u2018 hate speech , \u2019 and guarding vulnerable and helpless users from \u2018 disinformation \u2019 not emanating from \u201c reputable and trusted sources , \u201d namely mainstream media and government itself , because why would they ever lie or spin anything , right ?\nExpect these Kafkaesque cultural committees to step-up their efforts in 2020 , in the hopes that they can affect the outcome of the US Presidential election somehow , in favor of the Democratic candidate .\nBut beyond this , these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and content which opposes war and the national security state .\nDespite repeated denials by executives , their dark agenda is becoming more obvious by the day .\nGlobal Uprisings on the Rise \u2013 2019 saw a record number of simultaneous mass protests happening all over the globe , and still going .\nFrance \u2019 s Yellow Vests aka Gilet Jaunes , led the way , followed by mass movements across South America , Middle East and Asia .\nAll over the world , crowds are forming in their millions , with protesters @ @ @ @ @ @ @ taking over parliament buildings , while demanding an end to neoliberal austerity policies , scarce jobs and spiraling inflation .\nExpect these uprisings to grow and multiply , as people begin to challenge the 20th century orthodoxy of the hereditary oligarchy , and US dollar-led debt-based financial market rigging .\nThis will pose serious challenges to US client states worldwide , already struggling to hold together their economies and political mandates while over-spending on US military products \u2013 while the ranks of their poor and unemployed grow by the day .\nUltimately , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ respect for government and authority .\nIt \u2019 s that fundamental .\nThe Vindication of Julian Assange \u2013 More than any other story in 2019 , the apprehension and unlawful incarceration of award-winning journalist and WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange , left a black mark on the supposed \u2018 leaders of free world , \u2019 namely the United States and Britain .\nBut 2020 will most certainly be the year when Assange is vindicated \u2013 at least in the court of public opinion .\nIn the waning months of 2019 , the tide of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u2019 s favor .\nWith each passing week , more high-profile individuals , mainstream journalists and civil liberties advocates are coming out to defend Assange and demand his release .\nThe only group which has been reticent to speak for him has been politicians , with the exception of a few , like Hawaii Congresswoman Tulsi Gabbard , a 2020 Democratic Presidential hopeful .\nBut the real concern is whether he will survive the brutal treatment being dished out by the British state , now in breach of its own laws and precedents @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to what many agree is an authoritarian US government bent on revenge for the international embarrassment caused by WikiLeaks important exposures .\nUntil then , his life will continue to hang in the balance .\n# FreeAssange China Dubbed Axis of Evil \u2013 Move over Kim and Putin , there \u2019 s a new boogeyman in the making .\nThe US is fast losing its ability to manufacture enemies and existential threats it needs to justify its now $ 1 Trillion annual military budget , but there \u2019 s an answer to their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new red menace , and will gradually take the place of Russia as the new geopolitical threat to the American Dream .\nMore and more , we see US media pundits waxing on about the evils of \u201c communist China \u201d , and how the Chinese are \u2018 infiltrating \u2019 the US higher education system and \u201c undermining our democracy.\n\u201d The recent demonization of the Chinese authorities in Hong Kong , and the lionization of US-backed violent street thugs being marketed by Washington think tanks as \u201c peaceful democratic reformers \u201d \u2013 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about an expansion of the New Cold War into the Pacific front .\nThe US would also like to disrupt China \u2019 s planned economic revolution , the Belt & Road project , and plan using the \u201c Uyghur \u201d Muslim ethnic minority issue as a \u2018 human rights \u2019 flash point and pretext for isolating China \u2019 s internationally .\nThis latest phase of American fetish and chauvinism may last for years .\nBut economically speaking , China still holds all the cards , and the gold ( literally ) .\nLet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u2019 t lead to a serious shooting war , but it will certainly be used as fuel for the global arms race .\nIraq is Back \u2013 Just as the New Year rang in , Trump got the bright idea to bomb an Iraqi military base , killing a number of Iraqi People \u2019 s Mobilization Unit ( PMU ) soldiers \u2013 the same soldiers who had fought on the ground , died and defeated ISIS in 2017 .\nSupposedly , this US airstrike was in response to a rocket barrage the previous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a military compound near Kirkuk , in northern Iraq .\nAs usual , before the US could investigate what actually happened , it acted on \u2018 highly likely intelligence , \u2019 most probably from Israel , which assured Trump that Iran did it .\nSo the US justified their attack by claiming the Iraqi personnel killed were really \u201c Iranian militia , \u201d a false talking point which has become accepted as fact across the US political and media landscape .\nIn response , PMU fighters and their supporters stormed the US @ @ @ @ @ @ @ US controlled Green Zone \u2013 a threat not faced by the US since they effectively took over the country in 2003 .\nBecause of Washington \u2019 s insistence to frame every incident in the region as \u201c the work of the Iranian regime , \u201d it \u2019 s clear drive to war is being spurred on by US allies Israel and Saudi Arabia \u2013 both of whom would view Iran as an existential threat to their own regional political hegemony .\nBesides , the main goal here is to keep Iraq divided and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back on its feet economically and politically , and can never be close allies with its neighbors Syria and Iran .\nFor Washington and Tel Aviv , the road to Tehran has always been through Baghdad , only , it won \u2019 t work for Washington this time .\nIraqis are quickly realizing that it is the US , and not Iran , who has ruined their country , with only generations of pain and suffering to look forward to .\nUnfortunately , their country looks once again to become the pitch for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ West and Iran .\nLiberation of Idlib and Reclamation in Syria \u2013 After nine long years and many hundreds of thousands dead , and millions of refugees and internally displaced persons , the Syrian War appears to be heading for a final climax in 2020 .\nThe last remaining western and Gulf-backed terrorist stronghold is Syria \u2019 s northern province of Idlib .\nLate 2019 saw the Syrian Army make great strides with their Russian allies , retaking key town and districts from western and Turkish-backed al- Qaeda militants , as well as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this means we will likely see the end of al-Qaeda \u2019 s de facto Second Islamic State in Idlib , and with that , the death of the West \u2019 s popular myth the \u201c democratic revolution \u201d ( which never was ) in Syria .\nWhen this happens , all eyes will then shift over the northern east section of the country where the US is illegally occupying Syria \u2019 s oil fields and smuggling the oil out of the country to fund its clandestine operations .\nRight before the New Year @ @ @ @ @ @ @ video confronting US soldiers at a desert crossing , telling them \u201c you are occupiers \u201d and you will \u201c leave our country.\n\u201d Harbinger of things to come .\nLibya \u2019 s protracted Civil War \u2013 Libya is back in the center stage geopolitically , as multiple world powers throw their hat into the ring to try to gain control of the failed state created by NATO \u2019 s errand operation in 2011 to depose then President Gaddafi .\nBefore the New Year , Turkey \u2019 s President Erdogan began ferrying jihadi @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to help the UN-backed Government of Accord in Tripoli in the country \u2019 s new civil war .\nOn the other side are the US , Saudi Arabia , the UAE , Egypt and even Russia , all backing long-time US asset Khalifa Haftar , whose fighters are trying to capture Libya \u2019 s capital city of Tripoli \u2013 a real mess in the making .\nIf Syria is anything to go by , the presence of so many foreign stakeholders , along with jihadi fighters being shipped in as cannon fodder \u2013 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the instability the country is now facing will drag on for many years to come .\nThis round is only beginning , which means lots of foreign press junkets for war-friendly media outlets like CNN , but bad news for the people of Libya .\nGlobal Arms Race \u2013 With the US opting out of the INF treaty with Russia , while still hyping the phantom Russian threat in order to advance NATO further eastward , and with US threatening China in every possible way , while actively egging-on Saudi Arabia to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Yemen \u2013 the scene is set for a fresh bounce in the global arms race , led by the US , and with Russia and China trailing behind ( in terms of spending maybe , but not necessarily in terms of quality and effectiveness ) .\nAdd this To Trump \u2019 s recent announcement in 2019 of his new \u2018 Space Force \u2019 , and you have all the ingredients for record-level blank cheque spending on weapons and war tech .\nIt \u2019 s the 1980 \u2019 s on steroids .\nAdvances @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this price tag , as the West begins \u201c future-proofing \u201d all of its main product lines in defense and global surveillance .\nIf it sounds scary , it \u2019 s because it is .\nBREXIT ( Without the Exit ) \u2013 UK is scheduled to leave the EU on January 31 , 202o .\nThere are still some potential hurdles in the way however , the first of which is Brussels .\nWill the EU allow Britain to exit ?\nBelgian MEP Guy Verhofstadt has claimed that Britain still needs \u201c consent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ complete the final stage of Brexit .\nHowever , many Brexit critics believe that even if the UK leaves , it will still be opting into most of the EU conventions and regulations , and even the new \u201c EU Army \u201d aka EU Defense Union .\nSo will it be a \u2018 hard Brexit \u2019 aka a \u2018 no deal Brexit , \u2019 as Nigel Farage and others have been advocating for , or will it simply be BRINO ( Brexit Without the Exit ) ?\nWith Boris Johnson \u2019 s increasingly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ experiencing problems , it looks very much like the latter .\nThis means that what Britain will actually get in the end will be exactly what former PM David Cameron proposed in his white paper entitled , The Best of Both Worlds , released on the very same day the Brexit referendum was announced in February of 2016 .\nAfter nearly four years , and practically a civil war , Britain ends up back at square one , in effect .\nRule Britannia .\nBoris and the Economy Plummet \u2013 After Boris Johnson @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of their historic landslide elections win , reality will hit them soon enough .\nNow that the Brexit distraction is all but wrapped up , Conservatives will have to confront the reality of tens of millions of UK citizens who are still struggling to make ends meet and who have little hope for a prosperous future , seeing that the Tories are still as committed an ever to their unpopular austerity policies .\nAdd to this , the fact that there \u2019 s been little to no growth in business investment in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into recession amid the post-Brexit financial uncertainties to come .\nThat penny is now dropping , and UK plebs will not accept the old Brexit Punch \u2018 n Judy show for much longer .\nAt that point , public approval for Boris and the Tories will hit record lows , and with the Tories responding to any public dissent or manifestations \u2013 with an ever heavy hand of the authoritarian state .\nA recipe for discontent .\nEU Economic Crisis \u2013 One thing many experts can agree on is that Brussels has been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now .\nTen years after the 2008 global financial meltdown , it seems that the bankers are still up to their old tricks , increasing the odds that the next \u2018 black swan \u2019 economic crisis event will happen in the Euro zone .\nAs Politico remarked , \u201c The price to pay for those bailouts , reform packages , rescue funds , and European Central Bank bond-buying schemes has been political fragmentation , at first .\nBut by now , this is morphing into outright polarization .\nAnd this is happening in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ countries \u201d as we saw in elections in France , Germany , Austria and Italy.\n\u201d Political fragmentation will not help economic disparity between the rich North and poor South of Europe .\nAdd to this the reality of Brexit and the EU losing a significant chuck of its GDP from the UK , and you have a trend line forming which only needs a trigger to set off a financial inferno .\nOf course , if the EU economy does hit the wall , then it might give Boris Johnson and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ look like genius savants , as they take advantage of cheap wares on the continent , and sell to America via a new Trump trade deal .\nThe trigger could be Italy , or it could be reckless ECB bond purchasing schemes designed to hide the systemic damage caused by 10 years of steady quantitative easing which has left European personal savings next to nil .\nIf the global economy is going to scream again , it \u2019 s going to start in Europe in 2020 .\n\u2018 Antisemitism \u2019 Hysteria Backlash \u2013 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ UK \u2019 s 2019 General Election was the coordinated political assassination of Labour Party leader Jeremy Corbyn , falsely accusing him of being an \u2018 antisemite \u2019 and his party of being \u2018 antisemitic \u2019 ( meaning racist against Jewish people ) , with an attack coalition comprised of the mainstream press , the Tony Blair wing of the Labour Party , the Tory Party and of course , the international Israeli lobby .\nNow that the UK election is over , the British left and Labour voters will be looking for someone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the question of why there was such a coordinated national campaign of lies waged against their party leader .\nThrough this defamation campaign , the Establishment was able to force Labour to redefine the term antisemitism to encompass any normal criticism of the policies of the state of Israel and its horrific treatment of the native Arab Palestinian population in the Middle East .\nThe smear campaign worked , and helped Labour lose the election .\nBy killing the career of a life-long anti-racist campaigner like Corbyn , falsely accusing him of being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is possible in political warfare .\nThis political take-down was later used against Bernie Sanders in the US , although with less success because Bernie himself is Jewish , but that still has not deterred the attacks from the Right .\nThe main goal is to try and delegitimize both Corbyn and Sanders by making them unelectable , due to their support for Palestinian human rights and BDS ( Boycott , Divestment and Sanctions ) against Israel .\nBy doing this , it also means their progressive policies and re-nationalising public transport , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and providing debt forgiveness \u2013 will never see the light of day .\nUS academic Norman Finkelstein ( himself Jewish ) believes that the fake \u2018 antisemitism \u2019 campaign could eventually result in a very real antisemitic backlash against the Jewish lobby for their role in destroying the electoral chances of Jeremy Corbyn .\nIf that happens , then things will get very uncomfortable indeed .\nIsrael \u2019 s fall from grace \u2013 The sinking reputation of extremist Zionist leader Benjamin Netanyahu , along with the popularity of BDS , and the aforementioned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ smear campaign waged against Corbyn and Sanders \u2013 will only fuel support from the internationalist left-wing who oppose an Israeli apartheid regime actively engaged in an ethnic cleansing campaign to drive Arabs out of Arab lands .\nAnother problem for the current regime in Tel Aviv is that if the nine year-long Syrian War comes to a close , then the global community will once again focus on Israel \u2019 s crimes against humanity in Gaza and the West Bank , and its acts of military aggression against neighbors Syria , Lebanon and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u2019 s upcoming corruption trial , and the International Criminal Court \u2019 s new investigation into Israeli war crimes and crimes against humanity \u2013 and things are not looking good for this embattled 75 year-old micro-colonial settler-state creation of the Britain and the US .\n2020 will be the year that the Hasbara propaganda machine which has been propping-up Israel \u2019 s international reputation to \u2018 just above tolerable \u2019 will begin to collapse .\nAnd again , especially as the Syrian conflict begins to resolve itself and the world \u2019 s media @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the world \u2019 s largest open prison , Gaza , and Israel \u2019 s own institutionally racist and violent apartheid state being used to oppress the native Palestinians .\nMost sensible people will agree that a sincere solution to this issue is long overdue .\nNationalism vs The Global Citizen \u2013 Undoubtedly , 2018 and 2019 saw the strong re-emergence of nationalism in parts of the world \u2013 nationalism being the geopolitical and ideological antithesis of globalism and multilateralism which has dominated the latter part of the post-WWII , US-led liberal world @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this trend .\nSo despite the promises of globalism and projects like the European Union , the elemental pull of the post-Westphalian nation state appears to have survived , still in tact .\nHowever , this comes at a time when tens of millions of millennials , and GenX and GenZ neophytes are feeling ever-more connected due to social media , real-time translation apps , and shared digital cultural experiences ( mostly dominated by Anglo-American content ) through platforms like Netflix , whereby many young people consider themselves and identify as \u201c global @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nationality second .\nAlong with their global citizenry , also comes advocacy for no borders , and deference to global government concepts .\nWhile this view may be driven by a new idealism which may be naive and leaning heavily on utopian visions , it is nonetheless very real in the minds of those who identify as global citizens .\nThis demographic is increasingly influential and will be one of the key economic forces in the new digitally-driven Fourth Industrial Revolution .\nUltimately , this clashes with the rise of nationalism \u2013 itself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ last half century .\nIn 2020 will these two world views begin to collide with ever-more veracity , creating a new political schism ?\nExpect increased polarization along this new 21st century sectarian divide .\nThe New Occupy Movement \u2013 It \u2019 s been nine years since the Occupy Movement swept across North America and Europe .\nWe are starting to hear rumblings that it may be returning with a vengeance .\nOne of the catalysts for this renewed push into public spaces has been the 2019 \u2018 Climate Strike \u2019 youth movement @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but this might only be a celebrity-driven cause de celebre , held together by middle class students residing in North America and Western Europe .\nMeanwhile , the adult \u2019 s climate camp is now being driven by the ever-more radical Extinction Rebellion ( XR ) , a global environmental movement with a stated aim of using nonviolent civil disobedience to compel governments to \u2018 de-carbonize \u2019 their economies in order to save humanity from certain extinction \u2013 a radical idea underpinned by man-made global warming theory .\nThis Eco-Axis will no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 2.0 .\nMoreover , the reaction to Brexit and the Tory \u2019 s landslide victory in December \u2019 s UK General Election will have caused many on the political left to feel as if they \u2018 have no say \u2019 in the current democracy set-up in the West .\nThis similar effect happened after the 2016 US Election , where millennials could not simply accept that their party or candidate lost and prepare for the next election , but rather \u201c demand our voices be heard \u201d now , rather than in four @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is a result of the instant gratification culture we \u2019 ve seen rising in the West , as well a hangover from the Obama \u201c hope and change \u201d political ecstasy trip .\nEither way , it \u2019 s clear that millennials and GenXers now require some sort of immediate feedback mechanism which delivers them real-time results \u2013 because for them , representative democracy is no longer adequate to fulfill their needs and desires as social stakeholders .\nOne solution being promoted is the idea of \u201c People \u2019 s Assemblies \u201d and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But like all political enterprises , this too risks being co-opted , gamed , and taken over by big money interests , most likely from Wall Street-funded , and billionaire-run foundations and third sector NGOs .\nIn the end , these movements end up becoming \u2018 pressure release valves \u2019 for the Establishment , and have very limited scope for affecting the \u2018 change \u2019 which activists so desperately wanted in the first place .\nEco-Terrorism \u2013 As the narrative surrounding climate change becomes even more radicalized and activists adopt the theory that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a \u201c sixth mass extinction \u201d \u2013 all because of man-made carbon emissions , it stands to reason that faithful adherents of this \u201c end times \u201d narrative ( not unlike the end times eschatological narratives of the major religions ) will adopt more radical methods to pressure the halls of power and force political concessions \u2013 to \u2018 save the climate \u2019 .\nAs with animal rights extremism methods , Eco-terrorism has historical form , and with more radical narratives like those promoted by organizations like Extinction Rebellion \u2013 this has led @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u201c we have no future.\n\u201d What would previously be regarded as acts of civil disobedience may no longer suffice in the current nihilistic atmosphere .\nIf there was ever a ripe moment for the specter of Eco-Terrorism to rear its ugly head , then it may be in 2020 .\nThe Fall of Climatism \u2013 As the narratives become more militant and the hype surrounding Swedish teenager and \u2018 climate strike \u2019 leader Greta Thunberg loses steam , a growing global community of climate skeptics will likely receive more airtime , many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of man-made global warming theory aka \u2018 climate change \u2019 .\nIn recent years , many climate demonstrations , have taken on an increasingly weird cult-like atmosphere ( image , left ) , which may resonate with some urbanistas and hipsters , but could also be damaging its broad-based appeal .\nThe reality is no matter how extreme the predictions of doom , or the excoriations by Greta , the global economy will never de-carbonize by 2025 , or 2030 , or even 2050 , for the simple reasons that renewables can never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the world \u2019 s growing cities and overall energy needs .\nThe math just doesn \u2019 t add up .\nThere is also a significant backlash now to the proposed Green New Deal which will require trillions in taxpayer funds and money robbed from pension funds in order to finance as yet undiscovered \u201c green tech \u201d solutions , which many believe is really just a new \u2018 green dotcom bubble.\n\u2019 Combine this with indications that the earth is now heading into a solar minimum phase which will see more record cold @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you have all the ingredients for serious challenges to Climatism as the dominant eco-ideology of this epoch .\nThis transition will not happen over night , but it \u2019 s inevitable , as the backlash against a strictly imposed environment narrative , where dissent or questions are strictly forbidden \u2013 is simply unsustainable politically and as some experts now believe \u2013 it is also fundamentally undemocratic .\nThis will no doubt be the source of more heated battles ( no pun intended ) across society in 2020 .\n5G Implementation Begins \u2013 Interestingly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ appear to care about the impending 5G roll-out .\nThis completely untested and unregulated cellular technology is being aggressively pushed now by governments and corporations in the West , despite legitimate concerns for public health , as well as environment and ecological concerns too .\nClearly , 5G is seen as the gateway to realizing the technocrats dream of the Internet of Things , and also a total end-to-end mass surveillance state .\nIt \u2019 s already known that China \u2019 s new police state is using 5G as its digital backbone .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ blackout on this issue remains , and so it is likely that the process of full implementation will begin in 2020 .\nWhat could possibly go wrong ?\nThere it is .\n2020 , out of the frying pan .\nBut will it be into the fire ?\nHOW ACCURATE WERE WE ?\nTAKE A LOOKING BACK AT PREVIOUS YEARS\u2026 AROUND THE CORNER : 2019 Trends and Predictions from 21WIRE THE BIG SHUFFLE : 2017

fired some 22 missiles , hitting two US military installations located in Iraq \u2019 s Anbar province and in Erbil , Iraqi Kurdistan .\nAccording to US and Iraqi officials , the missiles caused no casualties .\nUS reports claim the American troops were hiding in bunkers before the missiles landed , following a tip off from their \u201c early warning \u201d missile detection system , although it \u2019 s more likely that the US received a phone call giving a 30 minute warning from officials in Iran via Washington \u2019 s intermediary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , CNN reported with typical national security gusto , \u201c US intelligence satellites had picked up signs of a heat signature from Iran , suggesting the country had just launched short-range ballistic missiles.\n\u201d It seemed like a wider war was well and truly on .\nAnd then suddenly it wasn \u2019 t .\nWhen news of the Iranian missile strike hit the headlines Tuesday evening east coast time , US President Donald Trump went silent for most of the evening , giving no press conference or televised address to the nation .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ was a typically glib remark followed by the usual tub-thumping on Twitter .\nLater that morning , Trump stood behind the White House podium .\nMany were expecting him to announce that the US would respond to Iran \u2019 s attack on US assets by retaliating in a \u201c disproportionate manner \u201d \u2013 just as he had promised only days earlier .\nInstead Trump stood down , announcing that the US would not respond militarily .\nThe Middle East , America , Europe , and the world , all breathed a sigh of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ US President had not come good on his own wild and flippant threats made earlier .\nAfter proclaiming \u2018 victory , \u2019 Trump then proceeded to issue new threats against Iran , vowing to increase Washington \u2019 s policy of \u201c maximum pressure \u201d with more crippling economic sanctions against Tehran ( even though the country is already practically under a full economic embargo ) .\nEmissaries Vice President Mike Pence and Secretary of War Mike Pompeo , and other surrogates , then took to media , all insisting that the White House @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bring Iran \u201c back to the negotiating table \u201d for a new nuclear deal to replace the current international JCPOA agreement which Trump trashed in May 2018 at the behest of Israeli PM Benjamin Netanyahu .\nTrump now wants a new deal which features a prohibition on Iran \u2019 s medium range missiles , and after events this week , it \u2019 s obvious why .\nWednesday \u2019 s missile strike by Iran demonstrates that the US can no longer operate in the region so long as Iran has the ability to extend @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Israel , and southwards to the Arabian Peninsula , and that includes all US military installations located within that radius .\nThis new reality should signal the beginning of the end of US hegemony in the Middle East , but unfortunately for the people of the region , Washington seems determined to go kicking and screaming towards this inevitable conclusion .\nIf this was a geopolitical IQ test , then this Administration just failed .\nAny expectations on Washington \u2019 s part that punitive sanctions combined with threats of military force will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ table \u2019 is really a fools errand , and shows the amateurish way in which this confused clique is conducting its foreign policy .\nAny decent undergrad student can tell you how basic game theory dictates that \u2018 maximum pressure \u2019 campaign and subsequent military threats \u2013 only guarantees that Iran will give zero concession to Washington .\nStill , Trump and his motley outfit of former Tea Party and next generation Neocon \u2018 expert \u2019 advisors , with various and sundry arms salesmen in tow \u2013 will happily carry on with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ingenuity and the will to pursue any other policy path , but because they are effectively held hostage by an anti-Iranian agenda which was conceived by Tel Aviv and rabidly backed by fundamentalist Christian Zionists in the United States \u2013 both of whom Trump needs to secure his own reelections in 2020 .\nSEE ALSO : Trump \u2019 s Fatal Mistake in Iraq and Beginning of End for US Occupation More interesting though , is how Washington \u2019 s leading war hawks all fell silent following Trump \u2019 s announcement that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u2019 s missile strike .\nEven arch-Neocon Lindsey Graham was muzzled .\nPerhaps he was expecting to realize his and former mentor John McCain \u2019 s life work of an all-out war with Iran and Russia .\nWhat this really indicates is that in the end , even the most bellicose pro-war voices in America did not have the stomach to finish what they had just started .\nEven with the \u201c most powerful military on earth , \u201d as Trump boasts , Washington \u2019 s fervent hawks still couldn \u2019 t overcome @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nThe dangerous tit-for-tat began on December 27 , 2019 , when a mysterious rocket barrage hit the K1 joint US-Iraqi base near Kirkuk , reportedly killing an American defense contractor , one Iraqi police officer , while wounding a further four US defense contractors and three Iraqi Army officers .\nTo date , no details \u2013 not even a name , has been given following the death of this mysterious \u201c American contractor \u201d in Kirkuk .\nAfter rejecting calls by Iraqi leadership to investigate who had actually fired the rockets , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u201d that the act was carried out by \u201c Iranian militia \u201d or Iraqi People \u2019 s Mobilization Units ( PMUs ) which the US crudely regard as \u201c Iranian \u201d ( even though they are actually Iraqi ) .\nThen on December 29 , 2019 , the US bombed five Iraqi military bases housing Iraqi PMUs , killing 30 Iraqi servicemen and wounded a further 50 , and once again , the US falsely claimed that all of their targets were all \u201c Iranian militia.\n\u201d This triggered a massive protest by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and comrades-in-arms of dead PMUs \u2013 targeting the US Embassy compound located in Baghdad \u2019 s Green Zone .\nPredictably , US officials claimed to have more \u201c intelligence \u201d that the embassy protest was somehow organized by Iran and Washington \u2019 s newest premier villain , Iranian Quds Force leader , General Qasem Soleimani .\nLater on Thursday January 3 , 2020 , the US government launched a drone attack outside Baghdad International Airport which assassinated Soleimani , along with senior Iraqi PMU commander , Abu Mahdi al-Muhandis .\nAccording to statements @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Abdul Mahdi , Soleimani may have been lured into a trap set by the United States , possibly with the help of Saudi Arabia .\nWriter Kim Sengupta from The Independent explains this incredible twist in the story : Iraq \u2019 s prime minister revealed that he was due to be meeting the Iranian commander to discuss moves being made to ease the confrontation between Shia Iran and Sunni Saudi Arabia \u2013 the crux of so much of strife in the Middle East and beyond .\nAdil Abdul-Mahdi was quite clear : \u201c @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the morning the day he was killed , he came to deliver a message from Iran in response to the message we had delivered from the Saudis to Iran.\n\u201d The prime minister also disclosed that Donald Trump had called him to ask him to mediate following the attack on the US embassy in Baghdad .\nAccording to Iraqi officials contact was made with a number of militias as well as figures in Tehran .\nThe siege of the embassy was lifted and the US president personally thanked Abdul-Mahdi for his help .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ Iraqis that it was unsafe for Soleimani to travel to Baghdad \u2013 quite the contrary .\nThis suggests that Trump helped lure the Iranian commander to a place where he could be killed .\nOf course , the US has vehemently denied that any of this is true , but it makes sense .\nFor US drones to accurately target Soleimani , it would require a series of hand-offs and accurate spotting , aided by the target possibly letting their guard down momentarily .\nIf this is what really happened , then it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is willing to go in order to provoke war , something which everyone should be alarmed about .\nFollowing these two acts of aggression by the US on Iraqi soil , PM Abdul Mahdi held an emergency parliament session where the government voted on whether the US forces should continue to be allowed to operate in Iraq .\nThis too was a historic moment : finally , after 15 years , a resolution was passed calling for the end of the US military occupation of Iraq .\n\u201c Iraqi priorities and the US @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the beleaguered but immobile Iraqi Prime Minister .\nTrump \u2019 s response to the will of the Iraqi people was to threaten Iraq with more economic sanctions should they move forward with plans to expel US troops , a neocolonial tantrum which can only be translated as a direct attack on Iraqi sovereignty .\nSo much for America \u2019 s mission to promote freedom and democracy in Iraq .\nBoth of these violent US provocations seemed sure to lead to a chain of escalation events which could have easily locked Washington , Tehran @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fait accompli of a wider multinational war .\nIn an impressive Orwellian stroke , President Trump went on to claim that the double assassination was somehow justified because Soleimani was a \u201c terrorist.\n\u201d He continued to lay it on thick , saying that the killing of \u201c sick monster \u201d Soleimani saved \u2018 a lot of lives \u2019 and that Soleimani \u201c was planning a big attack \u201d on US targets in the region .\nPentagon spokesmen claimed there was unspecific \u201c intelligence \u201d that Soleimani \u201c was actively developing plans to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Iraq and throughout the region.\n\u201d Still , there is no sign of any intelligence , or even a summary briefing by the White House .\n\u201c If Americans anywhere are threatened we have all of those targets fully identified and I am ready and prepared to take whatever action is necessary , and that particularly refers to Iran , \u201d exclaimed the President .\nIt \u2019 s worth noting that during his 2016 election campaign , Trump had no idea who Soleimani was .\nPeople should be under no illusion that Trump @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was then , the only difference now being that he \u2019 s surrounded by a gaggle of advisors whose own credentials should really be questioned after this whole debacle .\nIn a way which you can only do when you \u2019 ve got the moral high ground , Iranians took the PR initiative following Trump \u2019 s self-owning comments , with Iranian cleric , Shahab Moradi , saying that Iran might \u2018 struggle to hit-back \u2019 at a comparable US hero to General Soleimani , as the US only has \u201c fictional \u201d @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Are we supposed to take out Spiderman and Sponge Bob ?\n\u201d , quipped Moradi .\nUnaware of the rising tide of irony surrounding him , Trump took to Twitter again , this time threatening to incinerate many of Iran \u2019 s 5,000 year-old culture heritage sites .\nTo even threaten such action is regarded as a total abrogation of international laws and norms , although very much in line with the savage scorched earth methods of ISIS .\nIndeed , interesting company Trump finds himself with .\nIn a fit of bombast @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leaf from NBC \u2019 s disgraced anchor , Brian Williams , extolling the virtues of the Pentagon \u2019 s \u201c beautiful equipment \u201d thanks to \u201c Two Trillion Dollars \u201d provided by the US taxpayer ( and the Federal Reserve \u2019 s magic QE money tree ) .\nUndoubtedly , these are the words of a raving lunatic , and Americans might do well to seriously consider whether or not he is mentally fit to hold a chief executive position in the US government .\nThroughout all of this , no evidence has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back up these dramatic claims by the President and the Pentagon .\nThe public is simply expected to take their word for it .\nThis has prompted previously unheard of calls \u2013 made by US mainstream media pundits \u2013 for Washington to please reveal what evidence they actually have to justify US military actions over the last two weeks .\nDespite numerous requests from media and by members of the House and Senate , no such explanations are forthcoming .\nThis opaque approach by the White House caused US Senators Mike Lee ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) to come out in sharp opposition to the White House , citing the fact that Trump had used the same flimsy 2002 Authorization of Force which Bush used to illegally invade and occupy Iraq .\nAfter attending a classified briefing on Iran , Senators Lee and Paul revealed how Trump \u2019 s team ordered Senators \u201c not to debate \u201d the justifications to go to war with Iran , and that the White House will decide when and where to go to war without consulting Congress .\nLee called it , \u201c @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , at least on a military issue , \u201d and called \u201c insulting \u201d to the constitutional prerogative of Congress .\nTrump and the US war lobby continued to lay on the moxie , saying \u2018 no one will mourn Solemani \u2019 s passing.\n\u2019 Those propaganda lines quickly evaporated when scenes emerged from Iran , showing millions of Iranians taking to the streets in multiple cities , in what is now regarded as one of the largest televised funeral processions in world history .\nAs the week went on , all official @ @ @ @ @ @ @ talking points , all clearly designed to lend justification to US involvement in the previous military actions .\nThe most egregious of these was the fable that Iran \u2019 s General Solemani was a \u201c blood thirsty terrorist.\n\u201d Like all good propaganda , it \u2019 s main purpose is to conceal a truth which is diametrically opposed to the official government narrative .\nIn this case , US officials are desperate to hide the fact that not only was Qasem Solemani not a terrorist , but he was actually a leading force @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Qaeda , in Iraq and Syria .\nUnlike US forces who were intentionally kept well-away from \u2018 engaging \u2019 with ISIS and Al Qaeda , Solemani led the fight on the ground , while the US flew what can only be described as three years of largely meaningless air sorties , before eventually swooping in the final days of the Iraqi battles to hit actual targets at the request of the Iraqi military , and of course taking credit for \u201c defeating ISIS \u201d as Trump has done ad nauseum .\nOf course @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the real story \u2013 that it was the Iraqi PMUs \u2013 the very ones which Washington insists are \u201c Iranian militias \u201d and \u201c terrorists \u201d \u2013 who played the decisive role in the defeat of ISIS in Iraq during the fall of 2017 .\nSo it was the PMUs , the Syrian Army , Iranian special forces , Hezbollah , Russian forces , along with Kurdish YPG militants in Syria , who did all of the heavy lifting in the battle against ISIS from 2014 to 2017 .\nThe US did distinguish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ positive way , by racking up record civilian casualties during carpet bombing campaigns over Mosul and Raqqa , a fact which is now well-documented by numerous international organizations .\nAnother critical detail which has been conveniently ignored by US media , but was almost certainly noted by government officials , was a statement said to be issued by Iran \u2019 s Tasnim News which quoted Iranian officials who warned that any US retaliation against Iran \u2019 s strikes against US targets in Iraq will be regarded as \u201c a threat to widen the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ allies into play , \u201d and would result in Lebanon \u2019 s Hezbollah forces firing rockets into Israel .\nIn effect , Iran was treating the US and Israel as one entity in this fight .\nThis warning was most certainly headed by Israeli Benjamin Netanyahu , who quickly walked-back his hawkish stance on Iran , suddenly informing his Security Cabinet that Israel \u2018 must not be dragged into Soleimani killing.\n\u2019 From a strategic perspective , this was a pivotal moment , and showed just how exposed Israel and the US are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ impotent their Gulf allies are in the event of a wider war with Iran and its allies .\nFortunately for the world , Trump ultimately retreated from his threats made just days earlier to \u201c hit back \u201d at Iran .\nIn the end , his bark was worse than his bite , but his assent merely reflects the Pentagon \u2019 s own strategic assessments on an US war with Iran , concluding that the US couldn \u2019 t win should such a conflict go the distance .\nNow the whole world knows @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the West knew , but what many leading eastern analysts outside of America have known for quite some time \u2013 that from a geostrategic perspective , the US can not \u2018 win \u2019 a war against Iran in the New Middle East .\nNor could Israel protect itself from its exposure on all sides .\nBecause of these two physical realities , Trump had no choice but to back down .\nMoreover , it was Iran who was the rational actor , and Washington DC who demonstrated through their own unhinged and chaotic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ actor .\nOnce hostilities abated , Israeli hawks took to the media to reiterate the \u2018 certainty \u2019 of war with Iran , led by Brig .\nGeneral Ilan Lavi , former Deputy Head of the Northern Command , who warned that if US leaves the region , then Israel will eventually go to war with Iran .\nWhat \u2019 s he \u2019 s not saying is that this would automatically pull the US back into the fray anyway , leaving us neatly back at square one .\nWhat Lavi and others are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ underlying bones of contention in this story , namely illegal Israeli expansion and its continuation of the brutal apartheid regime and systematic ethnic cleansing campaign being waged against the native Palestinian Arab population .\nBoth are central to grievances of Palestinians , Lebanese , Syrians , Iraqis , and Iranians .\nStill , Trump is declaring this as a victory for US power , spinning his retreat as a \u201c win \u201d for a hapless base at home .\nSupporters ( and bot accounts ) have swarmed social media , imploring Americans to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u201c for side stepping WWIII \u201d \u2026 even after he nearly single-handedly started it .\nThis bit of counterintuitive # QAnon and # MAGA wizardry is a bit like congratulating an arsonist for helping put out a fire which he \u2019 s responsible for starting in the first place .\nSadly , this inverted cult-like thinking passes for esoteric wisdom in pro-Trump online circles , as followers clinging to the mythological belief set of MAGA cultists which dogmaticly believes that Trump is a supremely rational actor who is playing an uber-advanced geopolitical game @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , their fantasy projections lead nicely to more agit-prop talking points seeded by the CIA and their media adjuncts at CNN , both keen on leaving the door open for future escalation with Iran .\nFormer acting director of the CIA , Michael Morell told CNN \u2019 s passive inquisitor , Jake Tapper , that Tehran will soon be targeting high-ranking US officials in revenge for the killing of General Soleimani .\nJust like that , a new official conspiracy theory was injected into the national conversation .\nReaders should consider how in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unfounded speculation and fabricated \u2018 intelligence \u2019 ( now the norm in Washington ) , any third-party actor could target an US official , with a narrative planted by the US political establishment and its media arms , all of which has already been preemptively blamed on Iran .\nIt \u2019 s happened before in history , most noteably at the onset of WWI , with the assassination of Arch Duke Franz Ferdinand .\nIn this era of power politics and entangled alliances , the danger of such an event triggering a World @ @ @ @ @ @ @ concern .\nThe most dangerous aspect of the last two weeks is the proliferation of lies and fabricated \u2018 intelligence \u2019 claims which have been replete throughout all US statements relating to Iran .\nLikewise , the US continues to wage a devastating program of economic warfare against the people of Iran , while telling the western public that it \u2019 s really just to punish \u201c the regime.\n\u201d It \u2019 s the same broken record of invented crimes by the Iranian state , and still disturbing to watch US officials and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ designed to justify their own questionable military actions , but also which leave the door wide open for a future military confrontation with Iran and its allies .\nThe following day , Trump remarked at a press conference how he thinks that NATO should be expanded to include Middle East nations in the alliance .\nIt \u2019 s not hard to guess who he \u2019 s referring to .\nTrump wants to call it , \u201c NATOME.\n\u201d Perhaps Trump feels the US can no longer manage on its own , or that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to help balance against Iran and Syria , and also Russia .\nMore than anything , this should indicate a lack of American confidence regarding events of the past few weeks .\nOf course , NATO would be a disaster if it expanded in the Middle East .\nOne only has to look at Turkey \u2019 s own precarious situation and its awkward relationship with the US as a result .\nAny more Article 5 death spiral alliances will only invite additional problems and with that , the heavy hand of the US @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is trying to apply yesterday \u2019 s solutions to today \u2019 s reality .\nIt won \u2019 t work , and Europe will not be on board with it either .\nBack in 2006 , US Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice laid out her vision of a \u201c New Middle East , \u201d with the stated aim of eliminating the Hezbollah resistance forces , thereby boosting Israeli power in order to \u201c reshape \u201d the region according to US designs .\nUnfortunately for these Neocon visionaries , the opposite is now happening , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can do about , other than play a spoiler \u2019 s role .\nFor these and other reasons , what happened yesterday was historic , and signals one of the most significant realignments of the post-World War II era , alongside the equally significant watershed moment where Russia entered the Syrian War in October 2015 , both of which have changed the geopolitical face of region away from its previous crypto-colonial status managed by the US , Britain and France , and the West \u2019 s local enforcers , Israel and Saudi Arabia @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nIn theory , these new developments should foster a healthier balance of power in the region and globally , but the potential benefits may still be offset by the faltering Faustian pact between the Washington , London and their Anglo-American mideast beachhead , Israel .\nContinuing this geopolitical train wreck only ensures that any solution to the Palestinian crisis will be kicked further down the road , along with the Golan Heights issue , a sure recipe for more conflict and strife .\nThere is a New Middle East taking shape , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Condoleezza had in mind .\nRather , this one is being led Arab and Persian nationalist states , allied with Russia and China .\nThe longer the US and its allies stand in denial of this new reality , the longer the West \u2019 s tired old feedback loops will continue , all much to the deteriment of residents of the region , and American taxpayers back at home .\n*** Author Patrick Henningsen is an American writer and global affairs

Downing Street .\nAll this despite the fact that Corbyn has been a life-long anti-racism campaigner .\nThe Establishment \u2019 s propaganda and smear operation was successful enough to convince a large enough portion of the population that the socialist and anti-imperialist movement which swept Corbyn into power \u2013 was somehow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This will go down in history as one of greatest propaganda efforts ever \u2013 successfully creating a total inversion of reality in order to turn a general election .\nStill , even after the 2019 General Election and Tory landslide victory , the same cartel has continued their full-court press in a bid to dismantle the Labour Party , as Tony Blair \u2019 s pro-war neoliberal New Labour faction and the pro-Israel lobby team-up to intimidate and purge any remaining dissenters from the party \u2019 s ranks .\nBlairites are now openly using @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their political competition .\nIf the current Stalinist purge is allowed to continue , it runs the risk of ruining British politics for at least the next decade\u2026 Candidates for the leadership of the UK \u2019 s Labour Party have capitulated to new demands from the Israel lobby .\nThe Board of Deputies of British Jews is insisting that whoever replaces Jeremy Corbyn as Labour leader in April should effectively institute purges of the party membership .\nSo the fabricated \u201c anti-Semitism crisis \u201d in Britain \u2019 s main opposition party rages on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ month \u2013 which other Israel lobbyists have now claimed responsibility for .\nThe Board of Deputies on Sunday issued 10 \u201c pledges \u201d \u2013 or \u201c demands \u201d as The Jewish Chronicle reported \u2013 \u201c to end the anti-Semitism crisis.\n\u201d In what was clearly a coordinated action , all five candidates who have received sufficient nominations to be on the ballot paper in the leadership contest instantly agreed to the Board \u2019 s demands .\nThese included the supposedly left-wing shadow minister Rebecca Long-Bailey .\nShe commands the most support among Labour @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , with Keir Starmer , the party \u2019 s main spokesperson on Brexit , in second position .\nThe group Labour Against the Witch Hunt has condemned the demands , calling on candidates to reject them .\nLong-Bailey posted a fawning blog post on The Times of Israel website acceding to all the Board of Deputies \u2019 demands .\nIn a sign of how the witch hunt has becoming increasingly McCarthyite , she committed to expelling Labour members supposedly guilty of \u201c diminishing the problem of anti-Semitism.\n\u201d Her blog post was promoted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u2013 who has been part of the witch hunt for some time now .\nEmily Thornberry , another shadow minister now running to be leader , published an even more disgusting blog post on The Times of Israel .\nThornberry gives the game away by openly stating that the so-called crisis is really all about defending Israel .\nShe reveals that she launched a \u201c battle \u201d against Corbyn \u2019 s advisers over the 2019 manifesto \u2019 s Palestine policy \u2013 which included a commitment to an arms embargo against Israel for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is an organization that spends most of its time lobbying for Israel , but is also a Jewish communal body .\nIn its list of 10 demands , it said that

stipulations would give \u201c Jewish representative bodies \u201d \u2013 presumably including the Board itself \u2013 an effective veto over Labour \u2019 s disciplinary processes , including the

Movement is an openly Zionist organisation with intimate ties to the Israeli embassy in London .\nIt has been at the forefront of the manufactured \u201c Labour anti-Semitism \u201d campaign against Corbyn over the last four and a half years .\nThe Board also calls for Labour to endorse the International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance \u201c working definition \u201d of anti-Semitism \u201c without qualification.\n\u201d That controversial document has not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fight genuine anti-Semitism ; most of the \u201c examples \u201d cited by it concern Israel .\nSEE ALSO : Documentary : \u2018 The Israeli Lobby in Britain \u2019 ( 2017 ) Among other stipulations , the document prohibits denying \u201c the Jewish people their right to self-determination \u201d by criticizing Israel as

Palestinian , Black and other ethnic minority groups , and despite wide @ @ @ @ @ @ @ controversial document .\nBut Corbyn unsuccessfully attempted to append a qualifying statement to the document before it formally became party policy .\nCorbyn had sought to give Labour activists the freedom to describe Israeli policies as racist .\nLabour is also running an election for deputy leader .\nThat post became vacant following the resignation of Tom Watson last year .\nOf the five candidates to fill the vacancy , only Dawn Butler and Richard Burgon have not agreed to the Board \u2019 s demands .\nThe left-wing group Jewish Voice for Labour @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\n\u201c That this hostile body should be given a prominent \u2013 if not dominant \u2013 voice in the internal affairs of the Labour

.\nYou can start with the fact of who won the actual popular vote in the state .\nHint : it wasn \u2019 t the choice of party elites .\nBy now you have figured out that Democratic Party establishment have been backing a few select centerist candidates , led by 77 year-old former Vice President Joe Biden , long hailed as a \u201c top tier candidate \u201d and a \u201c front-runner , \u201d only this time he was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up and mic in hand , stalwart Biden only managed to hobble in at 4th , or 5th place \u2013 in a state that was meant to favor older establishment and centerist Democrats .\nNow he \u2019 s out of the top tier and trailing behind progressive leader Bernie Sanders , and conservative democrats Pete Buttigieg and Elizabeth Warren , and neck and neck with another marginal

impeachment train wreck haven \u2019 t done him any favors either .\nThe ramshackle proceedings seemed to create additional obstacles for Biden who now is unable to shake-off allegations of corruption and nepotism .\nWhen it \u2019 s all said and done , smart historians will look @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it actually was : an ornate partisan distraction engineered to conceal the Democrats \u2019 own rank

reasonable political analyst to conclude the Democratic Party might be the most corrupt political organization in the world , and that it would hardly bat an eyelid before trying to cheat or deceive its own voters .\nPolitical commentator Nathan Robinson summed-up just how bad Iowa has been for the Democratic Party , as he explains : If you \u2019 re a Sanders supporter , you have reason to be

point was Iowa \u2019 s total inability to perform the relatively simple task of counting people \u2019 s votes .\nBut Buttigieg , good McKinseyite that he is , was getting a head start on deploying

Democratic primary .\nThe contrast with the current president would work in her favor \u2013 even down to the music each plays at rallies .\nTrump likes to play a lot of really loud Rolling Stones music at his rallies .\nMeanwhile at this small rally in the Keene State College student center , Gabbard warmed the audience up with the music of Jack Johnson , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Shore who plays some of the most melodious music out there .\nNot only that , but Gabbard rejects a lot of the extremism that has flourished in the Democratic Party in the Trump era .\nIn an answer to a question from the audience on the student debt issue , she dismissed the idea of canceling all that debt .\nInstead she wants to regulate the often loan-shark-level interest rates and end the current ban on declaring bankruptcy on student debt .\nHer idea , an eminently sensible one , is that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cautious about lending out the money if they know the student in question won \u2019 t be able to pay it back .\nOn health care , she rejected Medicare-for-all in favor of a system that \u201c guarantees quality health care for everyone while allowing you to have a private plan.\n\u201d She also got in a shot at \u201c the pay-to-play culture in Washington \u201d in which Big Pharma and lobbyists rig the system to overcharge Americans .\nThat \u2019 s not far from Trump \u2019 s own rhetoric on prescription prices @ @ @ @ @ @ @ column on his Wildwood rally , Trump pushed the importation of cheaper prescription drugs from Canada and blasted the \u201c rich middlemen \u201d who have opposed such reforms .\nGabbard also sounds a lot like Trump when it comes to ending what both have termed \u201c regime-change wars.\n\u201d That \u2019 s gotten her in trouble with her fellow Democrats , she told me when I spoke with her after the rally .\n\u201c Unfortunately , when it comes to war in Washington there is one party and it is the party of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my brothers and sisters in uniforms who pay the price , \u201d said Gabbard , who worked with a medical unit in Iraq .\nThat \u2019 s not the kind of rhetoric that wins friends among Democrats .\nHillary Clinton termed her a \u201c Russian asset.\n\u201d At one debate , former South Bend Mayor Pete Buttigieg accused Gabbard of being \u201c like Donald Trump \u201d in her antiwar rhetoric .\nGuilty as charged .\nTrump has assailed \u201c foolish wars \u201d and also proclaimed that \u201c great nations do not fight endless @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the opposite this fall then I for one can \u2019 t wait to hear it .\nAnd in another shot at the leaders of her own party , Gabbard voted \u201c present \u201d on the Trump impeachment , making her one of only three House Democrats who failed to vote in favor of it .\nThat impeachment effort succeeded only in energizing the Republican base .\nI suspect in the long term it will be seen as a debacle for the Democrats .\nIn short term , however , the Democratic base is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Gabbard in the debates .\nEven though she \u2019 s been polling in the same range as rich-guy candidates Tom Steyer and Andrew Yang , they made the cut for the final New Hampshire debate Friday .\nBut she didn \u2019 t .\nAnd you \u2019 ll lose out on the macadamia toffee as well .\nBELOW -WATCH AT THE 2:54 MARK AS PETE BUTTIGIEG COMPARES TULSI GABBARD TO DONALD TRUMP FOR DESIRING

altered the course of the 2016 US presidential election was when candidate Hillary Clinton self immolated with what was meant to be a throwaway quip : \u201c You know , to just be grossly generalistic , you could put half of Trump \u2019 s supporters into what I call the basket of deplorables .\nRight ?\nThe racist , sexist , homophobic , xenophobic , Islamaphobic\u2014you name it .\nAnd unfortunately there are people like that .\nAnd he has lifted them up.\n\u201d And just like that , a quarter of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Democratic nominee , to languish in politically correct purgatory .\nMany political analysts believe that was the moment when Clinton well and truly lost the working class heartlands , shedding blue collar voters that had previously been a party stronghold for the Democrats .\nBut it seems that after four years of railing against President rump , the Democrats party never did any real much soul searching , at least not enough to generate enough self-awareness so as to avoid making that very mistake again in 2020 .\nOne is for sure : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Michael Bloomberg , never paid much attention to why Hillary lost in 2016 .\nIf he had , he would be doing this\u2026 .\nAs far as Trump supporters are concerned , one might well ask : \u201c When will more people have the courage to support Trump ?\n\u201d Still , such a barrage of moral lecturing might eventually lead one to question their association with Trump and the GOP \u2014 until someone like Mike Bloomberg comes along .\nBloomberg , the gazillionaire former mayor of New York who is seeking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , is quickly rivaling Trump on the sheer volume of regrettable words and deeds concerning women and minorities emerging from his recent past .\nBut Bloomberg \u2019 s biggest mistake may not be in whatever sins he may have personally committed ; it could be the contempt in which he apparently holds middle America .\nAn example came to light over the weekend with a 2016 video wherein Bloomberg described how simple \u2014 or simpleminded \u2015 he thinks it is to be a farmer .\n\u201c I could teach anybody , even people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ farmer , \u201d Bloomberg said during remarks at the Said Business School at the University of Oxford in England .\n\u201c You dig a hole , you put a seed in , you put dirt on top , add water , up comes the corn , \u201d explained Farmer Mike .\nThe Bloomberg campaign complained that the clip was selectively edited to obscure that Bloomberg wasn \u2019 t talking about modern-day practices , but even granting that rather generous interpretation , the comments were ignorant and tone-deaf .\nSimilarly problematic was the attitude @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\n\u201c You put the piece of metal in the lathe , you turn the crank in the direction of the arrow , you can have a job , \u201d he said .\nBloomberg said the new \u201c information economy \u201d demands that people \u201c think and analyze , \u201d which depends on \u201c a lot more gray matter \u201d than is apparently necessary to be a farmer or a factory worker , in his view .\nBloomberg \u2019 s words were soon answered with reminders of just how much brainpower , technology @ @ @ @ @ @ @ modern farmer , and his condescension was noted by pundits and politicians across the ideological spectrum .\nBut Bloomberg \u2019 s haughtiness has ramifications beyond his own presidential quest .\nMore troubling for Democrats is that it all contributed once again to the perception that the liberal elite views millions of Americans as uneducated , backward Neanderthals , or as comprising the \u201c credulous boomer rube demo , \u201d as political consultant Rick Wilson recently described it to a fit of giggles from CNN \u2019 s Don Lemon .\n( Lemon later said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just prior to Wilson \u2019 s comment , not at any group of people . )\nDemocrats who are backing Bloomberg might well be asked , \u201c Did you learn nothing from Hillary Clinton ?\n\u201d Clinton \u2019 s \u201c basket of deplorables \u201d description of \u201c half \u201d of Trump \u2019 s supporters \u2014 \u201c racist , sexist , homophobic , xenophobic , Islamophobic , you name it , \u201d she declared \u2014 undoubtedly lost her support in states that were supposedly part of the \u201c blue wall.\n\u201d Bloomberg didn \u2019 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his dismissiveness toward the skills and intelligence of farmers and other industrial workers demonstrates the same contemptuous ivory-tower attitude .\n( \u2026 ) Some Democrats are fretting about the possibility of nominating a socialist as their standard-bearer .\nTo be sure , that would be uncharted territory .\nBut they should worry even more about nominating another condescending elitist , because they know from four years ago how that

\u201c the icon of your generation \u201d .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ document , revealed by WikiLeaks , called Libya Tick Tock , prepared for Hillary Clinton , which described her as the central figure driving the destruction of the Libyan state in 2011 .\nThis resulted in 40,000 deaths , the arrival of ISIS in North Africa and the European refugee and migrant crisis .\nFor me , this episode of Clinton \u2019 s interview \u2014 and there are many others \u2013 vividly illustrates the division between false and true journalism .\nOn 24 February , when Julian Assange steps into Woolwich Crown Court @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crime on trial .\nI am sometimes asked why I have championed Assange .\nFor one thing , I like and I admire him .\nHe is a friend with astonishing courage ; and he has a finely honed ,

the evidence I have witnessed with the words and actions of those with power .\nIn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get a sense of how our world is controlled and divided and manipulated , how language and debate are distorted to produce the propaganda of false consciousness .\nWhen we speak about dictatorships , we call this brainwashing : the conquest of minds .\nIt is a truth we rarely apply to our own societies , regardless of the trail of blood that leads back to us and which never dries .\nWikiLeaks has exposed this .\nThat is why Assange is in a maximum security prison in London facing concocted political charges @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shamed so many of those paid to keep the record straight .\nWatch these journalists now look for cover as it dawns on them that the American fascists who have come for Assange may come for them , not least those on the Guardian who collaborated with WikiLeaks and won prizes and secured lucrative book and Hollywood deals based on his work , before turning on him .\nIn 2011 , David Leigh , the Guardian \u2019 s \u201c investigations editor \u201d , told journalism students at City University in London that Assange @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a puzzled student asked why , Leigh replied , \u201c Because he doesn \u2019 t understand the parameters of conventional journalism \u201d .\nBut it \u2019 s precisely because he did understand that the \u201c parameters \u201d of the media often shielded vested and political interests and had nothing to do with transparency that the idea of WikiLeaks was so appealing to many people , especially the young , rightly cynical about the so-called \u201c mainstream \u201d .\nLeigh mocked the very idea that , once extradited , Assange would end up \u201c @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were things , he said , \u201c that he and his lawyer are saying in order to feed his paranoia \u201d .\nThe current US charges against Assange centre on the Afghan Logs and Iraq Logs , which the Guardian published and Leigh worked on , and on the Collateral Murder video showing an American helicopter crew gunning down civilians and celebrating the crime .\nFor this journalism , Assange faces 17 charges of \u201c espionage \u201d which carry prison sentences totaling 175 years .\nWhether or not his prison uniform will be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ court files seen by Assange \u2019 s lawyers reveal that , once extradited , Assange will be subject to Special Administrative Measures , known as SAMS .\nA 2017 report by Yale University Law School and the Center for Constitutional Rights described SAMS as \u201c the darkest corner of the US federal prison system \u201d combining \u201c the brutality and isolation of maximum security units with additional restrictions that deny individuals almost any connection to the human world \u2026 The net effect is to shield this form of torture from any real public @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all along , and getting him to Sweden was a fraud to cover an American plan to \u201c render \u201d him , is finally becoming clear

Rapporteur on Torture , said recently , \u201c I could hardly believe my eyes .\nAccording to the testimony of the woman in question , a rape had never taken place at all .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u2019 s

son is the antithesis of the collusion and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our homeland .\nThe roll call of shame begins with Julia Gillard , the Australian Labor prime minister who , in 2010 , wanted to criminalise WikiLeaks , arrest Assange and cancel his passport\u2013 until the Australian Federal Police pointed out that no law allowed this and that Assange had committed no crime .\nWhile falsely claiming to give him consular assistance in London , it was the Gillard government \u2019 s shocking abandonment of its citizen that led to Ecuador granting political asylum to Assange in its London embassy .\nIn a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Gillard , a favourite of the US embassy in Canberra , broke records for sycophancy ( according to the website Honest History ) as she declared , over and again , the fidelity of

Conservative ) Member of Parliament , Malcolm Turnbull .\nAs a young barrister in the 1980s , Turnbull had successfully fought the British Government \u2019 s attempts to prevent the publication of the book , Spycatcher , whose author Peter Wright , a spy , had exposed Britain \u2019 s \u201c deep state \u201d .\nWe talked about his famous victory for free speech and publishing and I described

genuine interest and an aide took extensive notes .\nI asked him to deliver a letter to the Australian government from Gareth Peirce , the renowned British human rights lawyer who represents Assange .\nIn the letter , Peirce wrote , \u201c Given the extent of the public discussion , frequently on the basis of entirely false assumptions\u2026 it is very hard to attempt to preserve for [ Julian Assange ] any presumption of innocence .\nMr. Assange has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two Damocles swords , of potential extradition to two different jurisdictions in turn for two different alleged crimes , neither of which are crimes in his own country , and that his personal safety has become at risk in circumstances that are highly politically charged.\n\u201d Turnbull promised to deliver the letter , follow it through and let me know .\nI subsequently wrote to him several times , waited and heard nothing .\nIn 2018 , John Shipton wrote a deeply moving letter to the then prime minister of Australia asking

"Today , the President \u2019 s long-time friend and former campaign consultant , Roger Stone , was sentenced to 40 months in a federal prison for multiple charges relating to his Congressional testimony and Robert Mueller \u2019 s Russia probe .\nUS District Judge Amy Berman Jackson issued Stone \u2019 s sentence after his lawyers had first requested that he receive no prison time .\nAfter the sentence was handed down , Stone refrained from making a personal statement to the court .\nThe prosecution originally asked for a 7 to 9 years sentence , so today \u2019 s ruling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dept of Justice who weighed-in in January to reduce the sentence .\nWhen that story broke , Trump was also tweeting like mad in the background which triggered a partisan storm drawing accusations of the President imposing his will on the judiciary , although the timeline of events suggests that the DOJ intervened on its own volition .\nNormally , one might refrain from criticizing a judge too harshly , but this was no ordinary closing remarks performance , as Judge Jackson seemed to go on forever , attempting to address all of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ want to justify the premise of the legal proceedings .\nAfter reviewing her statements , to say ( and I don \u2019 t say this lightly ) that she had personal axe to grind is an understatement , and her extended diatribe appears to point to an obvious political agenda .\nJudge Jackson wasn \u2019 t shy about showing her bias either , remaining in lockstep with the original RussiaGate narrative \u2013 even though it \u2019 s been proven to be hoax after a 3 year-long Mueller Investigation produced no evidence of alleged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to do this here : \u201c He was not prosecuted for standing up for the president , \u201d said Judge Jackson during her closing remarks .\n\u201c He was prosecuted for covering up for the president.\n\u201d Only the President did nothing which required covering for .\nAs that wasn \u2019 t enough , the judge went on during her hours-long sentencing hearing to claim that what Roger Stone did was somehow \u201c a threat to our democracy \u201d .\nWe \u2019 re still trying to work out exactly what she is talking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ year-old Stone became so powerful as to bring down democracy in the United States .\nI mean , he has certain skills , but take down the United States of America ?\nHere Jackson is dog whistling to the RussiaGate consensus \u2013 when in fact there was no collusion between Stone , Trump , WikiLeaks and Russia \u2013 nor did Stone have any \u2018 back channel \u2019 to WikiLeaks .\nAny rational , objective professional might look at that and conclude that there was no underlying conspiracy which this entire Russia Investigation effort @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is , Stone \u2019 s entire case was erected to help maintain the RussiaGate narrative , but to help towards delegitimizing Trump \u2019 s historic 2016 upset victory .\nValidating the hoax also helps to fortify a hawkish US foreign policy against Russia , and all the political , geopolitical and military industrial spoils that go with it .\nIn response to public comments made by Trump about the trial being a farce , Judge Jackson felt compelled to defend her political show trial , exclaiming that , \u201c There was nothing unfair @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or the prosecution.\n\u201d If only it ended there .\nShe kept going , insisting that the Stone case was \u2018 serious \u2019 and not a joke , which Trump had publicly intimated .\n\u201c The problem is nothing about this case was a joke , \u201d said Jackson just prior to sentencing Stone .\n\u201c It wasn \u2019 t funny .\nIt wasn \u2019 t a stunt and it wasn \u2019 t a prank , \u201d said Jackson .\nThat old Hamlet adage comes to mind , The lady doth protest too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ President \u2019 s insistence on weighing-in with such vigour , it seems likely that Stone will eventually be pardoned by Trump , but it \u2019 s not certain when .\nSome have speculated that the White House would be better served to wait until after the General Election , but then again , Trump tends to defy the experts on conventional logic .\nAs I wrote in a feature published this morning at RT International , Roger Stone was simply the last available scalp for the Mueller brigade in order to lend credence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Stone \u2019 s criminal case is built on top of .\nHis criminality was assumed under the guise \u2018 Trump-Russia Collusion \u2019 which is predicated on the as yet evidence-free official conspiracy theory that Russian GRU operatives hacked the DNC and Podesta and then gave those emails to Julian Assange and WikiLeaks .\nI explained how the underlying assumptions are fallacies and why the underlying assumptions in this case never did raise to the standard of criminality , while all of the little process crimes and reprimand which came during the legal circus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ build up Stone \u2019 s charge sheet .\nI encourage readers to please go and read my feature here : Roger Stone \u2019 s conviction is the last hope to save RussiaGate In the end , all of this is just more grist to the mill .\nBut for how much longer ?\nThe level of panic and desperation surrounding this case , as well as the politicized behavior of the judge and prosecutors \u2013 really demonstrated how deeply infected the federal judiciary with partisan propaganda and conspiracy theories of Russian interference which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , objective judge or jury would look at this picture and deduce that there were definitely a lot of things going on here ( like things that happen during elections , leaks and campaign bluster ) , but not a crime .\nFor the prosecution , of the supposed \u2018 crimes \u2019 came long after 2016 , as part of the process of trying to prove there was Trump-Russia Collusion , which there wasn \u2019 t .\nSo one should consider Roger Stone as collateral damage in what is perhaps the greatest political @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , very few will step forward and stand-up for a character like Roger Stone , and why would they ?\nHe \u2019 s a flamboyant political operative who cut his teeth working under Richard Nixon of all people .\nHe \u2019 s guy everyone loves to hate , so the support is sparse .\nBut let \u2019 s not forget that back when this all began \u2013 it was Stone who told Congress that there was never any Russian involvement .\nOf course , Stone was right , and the evidence is on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other hand , was wrong .\nYet , here we are three years later , still re-litigating an election which happened four years ago .\nWhen will American exercise its 2016 collective trauma and return to some semblance of sanity ?\nSEE ALSO : The Stalinist Show Trial of Roger Stone", "author": "21wire", "url":

another story began drifting out into the media sphere \u2013 another potential spanner in the works just in time for part one of Julian Assange \u2019 s US extradition hearing which is due to commence this Monday .\nAccording to a revelation aired during a recent scheduled case hearing on Wednesday by a member of Assange \u2019 s defence team , Edward Fitzgerald QC , Assange was informally offered some kind of pardon deal by a US representative during the first year of the Trump Administration .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ Assange \u2019 s lawyer Jennifer Robinson , reportedly saying : This statement is referring to former US Congressman Dana Rohrbacher ( R-CA ) who says he visited Assange as part of Rohrbacher \u2019 s own independent \u2018 fact finding mission \u2019 at London \u2019 s Ecuadorian Embassy in August 2017 , near the beginning of the Mueller Investigation .\nThe White House has firmly denied the claim and states the President had no contact with Rohrbacher .\nBefore we continue and unravel what has been said and by whom , there are three @ @ @ @ @ @ @ consider .\nThe first and most importantly \u2013 is the media spin aspect .\nGiven that this is both a highly-charged partisan , as well as geopolitical case , and that we are just days away from the start of Assange \u2019 s historic extradition hearing , there are powerful forces , be they state , partisan or media \u2013 who will try and spin this and other \u2018 bombshells \u2019 in a way which suits their political agenda .\nIt also goes without saying that there are agents of influence within mainstream @ @ @ @ @ @ @ able to manipulate , twist , distort or fabricate any aspect of a story like this in order to further the interests of the two primary government stakeholders in this case , the United States and United Kingdom .\nThis has already been demonstrated time and time again with the Assange story , most notably by The Guardian newspaper who completely fabricated at least one headline story by Luke Harding and Danny Collyns claiming that former Trump campaign manager Paul Manafort had visited Julian Assange in the Ecuadorian Embassy .\nThe Guardian then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a sequel in which they used Harding \u2019 s Manafort story to help bolster another bogus claim that an ally of Nigel Farage was attempting to obtain emails from WikiLeaks .\nBottom line : if there is any opportunity to advance a Trump-Russia or RussiaGate narrative , there are mainstream journalists and editors ready to publish or say anything , even if it \u2019 s a complete lie .\nThe second thing to consider is how this latest news will factor into Julian Assange \u2019 s extradition hearing next week .\nAnd thirdly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ story will ultimately help , or hurt the real protagonist in this case , Julian Assange .\nMost certainly , the mainstream media have distorted this story from the word go , mostly to advance anti-Trump and anti-Russian narratives .\nWe \u2019 ll look at two reports , one from the Daily Beast , and the other from the UK \u2019 s Independent .\nThe Daily Beast story written by Nico Hines carries an over-the-top headline , \u201c Trump Offered Assange Pardon if He Covered Up Russian Hack , WikiLeaks Founder \u2019 s @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this isn \u2019 t actually what the lawyer said .\nThe headline doesn \u2019 t actually correspond with the claims made below in the article .\nHine \u2019 s own article does not stipulate that Trump himself made such an offer to Assange .\nHine then repeats the same lie in the sub-header , saying that Rohrbacher \u201c had brought the message to London from Trump.\n\u201d In addition to this , the headline erroneously asserts that Assange is also orchestrating a cover-up .\nNo doubt the Daily Beast \u2019 s management and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ percentage of online readers , especially those seeing content via social media , only skim the headline of a post and do not read the body of the article ( content engineers need to know this data because it is how they place and bill for advertising space ) .\nIn addition to this , according to a statement made by former Congressman Dana Rohrbacher , the former Congressman denies having made a pardon offer on behalf of Trump , saying that he made a proposition to Assange that if the WikiLeaks founder @ @ @ @ @ @ @ provided the DNC and related email leaks , Rohrbacher would do his best to lobby the President for a pardon .\nTechnically , this is not breaking news , as it was reported back in September 2017 my multiple mainstream outlets .\nJust below the Daily Beast \u2019 s gratuitous headline is stamped with \u201c Quid Pro Quo \u201d in red lettering , Here author Hines was attempting to re-purpose the UkraineGate-Impeachment accusation of Trump \u2019 s abuse of power in asking the Ukrainian President Zelensky for an illicit \u2018 Quid Pro Quo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ another under-the-table dodgy deal .\nAbove all , this story is being crafted to look as if Trump was in league with Assange to try and cover-up any Russian involvement in the DNC Leaks and the 2016 Election \u2013 leaving the reader to assume that there was Russian involvement .\nThis story is complete spin and clickbait by the Daily Beast .\nIn classic propaganda style , the author also uses this opportunity to reinforce the usual laundry list of unproven RussiaGate narrative talking points , stating a series of evidence-free assertions and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ facts ( now standard operating procedure for most US mainstream outlets ) : \u201c Russia \u2019 s involvement in hacking emails from the Democratic National Committee.\n\u201d \u201c WikiLeaks posted the stolen DNC emails after they were hacked by Russian operatives.\n\u201d This is followed by a cheap , ad hominem smear against Rohrbacher : \u201c Rohrabacher , who was known as Putin \u2019 s favorite congressman.\n\u201d Like The Guardian , formerly a respectable newspaper , the UK \u2019 s Independent has become a formidable online propaganda outlet .\nIt \u2019 s @ @ @ @ @ @ @ further , adding \u2018 Russian election interference \u2019 for good measure : \u201c Trump offered to pardon Assange if he covered up Russian interference in US election , court told \u201d .\nOf course , this is not what the court was told , but the truth doesn \u2019 t seem to be a priority for these mainstream outlets .\nIt repeats most of the lies woven through the Daily Beast article , and then builds a partisan angle on top of the initial lie , making reference to the 2020 US election @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for Mr Trump \u2019 s re-election effort if proven true.\n\u201d Note also the use of the cheap throwaway propaganda phrase , \u201c if proven true \u201d \u2013 which more often than not denotes a fake allegation , and is proof of deceptive intent , or a pre-existing agenda or bias by the author .\nA similar election smear here : \u201c It \u2019 s another indication that Trump \u2019 s assault on the rule of law isn \u2019 t new ; it \u2019 s been ongoing throughout his term .\nAnd imagine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yet know.\n\u201d The propaganda housekeeping continues , advancing the official conspiracy theory that the DNC and Clinton emails were hacked , when there is still no proof to validate this claim , citing a likely partisan source , Obama CIA official Ned Price : \u201c A series of emails embarrassing for the Democrats and the Hillary Clinton presidential campaign were hacked before being published by WikiLeaks\u2026 \u201d More of the same , reinforcing unproven , untested accusations tabled by Mueller probe : The Mueller investigation , published in April , found Russian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ private server for the first time just hours after Mr Trump \u2019 s public request for Russia to \u201c find the 30,000 emails that are missing \u201d .\nNeedless to say , when it comes to stories like this , most mainstream media outlets are not fit for purpose , and most likely co-opted by some partisan interests , or worse , by an intelligence agency .\nHistory is replete with examples of this .\nThe second consideration is : how will this latest revelation effect Julian Assange \u2019 s extradition hearing next @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all of the media and partisan spin , you can see that this new information was introduced by the defense for a reason which may have less to do with Trump and Russia , and more to do with substantiating a complaint made by the defense that Assange should not be extradited to the U.S. because Washington \u2019 s case against him is in fact politically motivated .\nIn this case , as a serving member of Congressman , Rohrbacher \u2019 s meeting with Assange and solicitation of a deal automatically proves that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ advance of the Department of Justice \u2019 s 18 superceding indictments of Assange served this past summer .\nIn addition to this , the defense has proof of a CIA-led operation which spied on Assange in the Ecuadorian Embassy in London , which included surveillance of his discussions with his attorneys .\nTaken together , these two pieces of evidence could be crucial in the defense \u2019 s effort to have the US extradition request overturned on the basis that the US effort is entirely politically motivated and therefore in violation the extradition @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tweeted out today that this Rohrbacker story will come into play on Tuesday \u2019 s session of the hearing .\nWikiLeaks also points out the issue of the timeline of events with this story \u2013 that the Rohrbacher meeting took place long after Assange had publicly stated that his source for the DNC leaks was not a sate actor .\nIn addion to this , former UK Ambassador and friend of Assange , Craig Murray , has also declared publicly ( and confidently ) on numerous occasions that the source was not Russia @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u2019 .\nFrom Sputnik News : In December 2016 Murray told Radio Sputnik that the DNC Leaks had \u201c absolutely nothing to do with Russia \u201d .\nHe said that he discovered the source while attending a whistleblowing conference in the US and stressed that it came from \u201c official circles in Washington DC \u201d .\nLastly , there is the question of whether or not the Dana Rohrbacher story will help , or hurt the credibility of Julian Assange and WikiLeaks .\nAs I have stated a number of times previously , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Assange lies in the language in which they have reframed Assange and WikiLeaks from being a journalist and a press outlet , and instead labeled him as a \u2018 cyber terrorist and Russian asset \u2019 , and a \u2018 hostile non-state foreign intelligence service \u2019 , respectively .\nThis reframing will also allow the US to strip Assange and WikiLeaks of any first Amendment protections upon arrival in the US , as well as justify Special Administrative Measures , which places Assange essentially in the same category as an enemy combatant or terrorist @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exercise more credible is by attacking the credibility of both Assange and WikiLeaks , to portray them as not acting like \u2018 conventional journalistic outlets , \u2019 simply to demonstrate that Assange and WikiLeaks are cavalier or careless in keeping to their journalistic principles .\nThis is where the claims made by Dana Rohrbacher might be used to undermine Julian Assange \u2019 s insistence that WikiLeaks protects their sources at all costs .\nThe insinuation by Rohrbacher \u2013 which has now cascaded through the world \u2019 s media \u2013 is that Assange was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Washington who leaked the DNC emails in order to save his own skin in the form of a pardon from President Trump .\n\u201c Upon my return , I spoke briefly with Gen. Kelly .\nI told him that Julian Assange would provide information about the purloined DNC emails in exchange for a pardon.\n\u201d In his statement posted on Feb. 20 , 2020 , Rohrbacher was careful not to state explicitly that Assange had told him \u201c Yes \u201d and agreed to give up his source in exchange for a Presidential @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Rohrbacher \u2019 s above quote , \u201c I told him that Julian Assange would provide information\u2026 \u201d \u2013 but he does not specify what exactly that information would be : a source , contextual information , deductive information , ie .\nwho it wasn \u2019 t , or some other forensic evidence which would rule out a Russian state actor .\nIt \u2019 s hard to know at this point , but that didn \u2019 t stop the mainstream media from colonizing that vacuum of information with the usual bevy of speculation , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ earlier in this article .\nBut the general impression in all of the reporting and from the Congressman himself , is that Assange had told Rohrbacher he would indeed give up his source in exchange for a pardon .\nThis does not square with many vehement statements made by Assange about maintaining the integrity of WikiLeaks \u2019 sources .\nWho would really expect Assange to have have suffered this ten-year long ordeal \u2013 only to suddenly trust an emissary of the United States government to keep his promise to make good on some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ freedom ?\nIt \u2019 s also worth noting here that this same narrative mirrors a story which has been circulating somewhat under the radar for months , about a former FOX News contributor named Ellen Ratner ( late brother Michael Ratner had been a U.S. lawyer for WikiLeaks ) who says she visited with Assange in the Ecuadorian Embassy in the fall of 2016 .\nClaims about her visit were then made by an alleged associate , another FOX News contributor and Dallas financial manager named Ed Butowsky \u2013 and Butowsky claims that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ source was

"21stcenturywire", "title": "What\u2019s Really Behind Rohrabacher\u2019s \u2018Assange Pardon\u2019 Story?", "content": "Just as Roger Stone \u2019 s sentencing was getting underway this afternoon , another story began drifting out into the media sphere \u2013 another potential spanner in the works just in time for part one of Julian Assange \u2019 s US extradition hearing which is due to commence this Monday .\nAccording to a revelation aired during a recent scheduled case hearing on Wednesday by a member of Assange \u2019 s defence team , Edward Fitzgerald QC , Assange was informally offered some kind of pardon deal by a US representative during the first year of the Trump Administration .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ Assange \u2019 s lawyer Jennifer Robinson , reportedly saying : This statement is referring to former US Congressman Dana Rohrabacher ( R-CA ) who says he visited Assange as part of Rohrabacher \u2019 s own independent \u2018 fact finding mission \u2019 at London \u2019 s Ecuadorian Embassy in August 2017 , near the beginning of the Mueller Investigation .\nThe White House has firmly denied the claim and states the President had no contact with Rohrabacher .\nBefore we continue and unravel what has been said and by whom , there are three @ @ @ @ @ @ @ consider .\nThe first and most importantly \u2013 is the media spin aspect .\nGiven that this is both a highly-charged partisan , as well as geopolitical case , and that we are just days away from the start of Assange \u2019 s historic extradition hearing , there are powerful forces , be they state , partisan or media \u2013 who will try and spin this and other \u2018 bombshells \u2019 in a way which suits their political agenda .\nIt also goes without saying that there are agents of influence within mainstream @ @ @ @ @ @ @ able to manipulate , twist , distort or fabricate any aspect of a story like this in order to further the interests of the two primary government stakeholders in this case , the United States and United Kingdom .\nThis has already been demonstrated time and time again with the Assange story , most notably by The Guardian newspaper who completely fabricated at least one headline story by Luke Harding and Danny Collyns claiming that former Trump campaign manager Paul Manafort had visited Julian Assange in the Ecuadorian Embassy .\nThe Guardian then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a sequel in which they used Harding \u2019 s Manafort story to help bolster another bogus claim that an ally of Nigel Farage was attempting to obtain emails from WikiLeaks .\nBottom line : if there is any opportunity to advance a Trump-Russia or RussiaGate narrative , there are mainstream journalists and editors ready to publish or say anything , even if it \u2019 s a complete lie .\nThe second thing to consider is how this latest news will factor into Julian Assange \u2019 s extradition hearing next week .\nAnd thirdly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ story will ultimately help , or hurt the real protagonist in this case , Julian Assange .\nMost certainly , the mainstream media have distorted this story from the word go , mostly to advance anti-Trump and anti-Russian narratives .\nWe \u2019 ll look at two reports , one from the Daily Beast , and the other from the UK \u2019 s Independent .\nThe Daily Beast story written by Nico Hines carries an over-the-top headline , \u201c Trump Offered Assange Pardon if He Covered Up Russian Hack , WikiLeaks Founder \u2019 s @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this isn \u2019 t actually what the lawyer said .\nThe headline doesn \u2019 t actually correspond with the claims made below in the article .\nHine \u2019 s own article does not stipulate that Trump himself made such an offer to Assange .\nHine then repeats the same lie in the sub-header , saying that Rohrabacher \u201c had brought the message to London from Trump.\n\u201d In addition to this , the headline erroneously asserts that Assange is also orchestrating a cover-up .\nNo doubt the Daily Beast \u2019 s management and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ percentage of online readers , especially those seeing content via social media , only skim the headline of a post and do not read the body of the article ( content engineers need to know this data because it is how they place and bill for advertising space ) .\nIn addition to this , according to a statement made by former Congressman Dana Rohrabacher , the former Congressman denies having made a pardon offer on behalf of Trump , saying that he made a proposition to Assange that if the WikiLeaks founder @ @ @ @ @ @ @ provided the DNC and related email leaks , Rohrabacher would do his best to lobby the President for a pardon .\nTechnically , this is not breaking news , as it was reported back in September 2017 my multiple mainstream outlets .\nJust below the Daily Beast \u2019 s gratuitous headline is stamped with \u201c Quid Pro Quo \u201d in red lettering , Here author Hines was attempting to re-purpose the UkraineGate-Impeachment accusation of Trump \u2019 s abuse of power in asking the Ukrainian President Zelensky for an illicit \u2018 Quid Pro Quo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ another under-the-table dodgy deal .\nAbove all , this story is being crafted to look as if Trump was in league with Assange to try and cover-up any Russian involvement in the DNC Leaks and the 2016 Election \u2013 leaving the reader to assume that there was Russian involvement .\nThis story is complete spin and clickbait by the Daily Beast .\nIn classic propaganda style , the author also uses this opportunity to reinforce the usual laundry list of unproven RussiaGate narrative talking points , stating a series of evidence-free assertions and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ facts ( now standard operating procedure for most US mainstream outlets ) : \u201c Russia \u2019 s involvement in hacking emails from the Democratic National Committee.\n\u201d \u201c WikiLeaks posted the stolen DNC emails after they were hacked by Russian operatives.\n\u201d This is followed by a cheap , ad hominem smear against Rohrabacher : \u201c Rohrabacher , who was known as Putin \u2019 s favorite congressman.\n\u201d Like The Guardian , formerly a respectable newspaper , the UK \u2019 s Independent has become a formidable online propaganda outlet .\nIt \u2019 s @ @ @ @ @ @ @ further , adding \u2018 Russian election interference \u2019 for good measure : \u201c Trump offered to pardon Assange if he covered up Russian interference in US election , court told \u201d .\nOf course , this is not what the court was told , but the truth doesn \u2019 t seem to be a priority for these mainstream outlets .\nIt repeats most of the lies woven through the Daily Beast article , and then builds a partisan angle on top of the initial lie , making reference to the 2020 US election @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for Mr Trump \u2019 s re-election effort if proven true.\n\u201d Note also the use of the cheap throwaway propaganda phrase , \u201c if proven true \u201d \u2013 which more often than not denotes a fake allegation , and is proof of deceptive intent , or a pre-existing agenda or bias by the author .\nA similar election smear here : \u201c It \u2019 s another indication that Trump \u2019 s assault on the rule of law isn \u2019 t new ; it \u2019 s been ongoing throughout his term .\nAnd imagine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yet know.\n\u201d The propaganda housekeeping continues , advancing the official conspiracy theory that the DNC and Clinton emails were hacked , when there is still no proof to validate this claim , citing a likely partisan source , Obama CIA official Ned Price : \u201c A series of emails embarrassing for the Democrats and the Hillary Clinton presidential campaign were hacked before being published by WikiLeaks\u2026 \u201d More of the same , reinforcing unproven , untested accusations tabled by Mueller probe : The Mueller investigation , published in April , found Russian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ private server for the first time just hours after Mr Trump \u2019 s public request for Russia to \u201c find the 30,000 emails that are missing \u201d .\nSEE ALSO : Media Spinning \u2018 Assange Pardon \u2019 as Proof of Russiagate Conspiracy Needless to say , when it comes to stories like this , most mainstream media outlets are not fit for purpose , and most likely co-opted by some partisan interests , or worse , by an intelligence agency .\nHistory is replete with examples of this .\nThe second consideration is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Julian Assange \u2019 s extradition hearing next week ?\nIf you can filter out all of the media and partisan spin , you can see that this new information was introduced by the defense for a reason which may have less to do with Trump and Russia , and more to do with substantiating a complaint made by the defense that Assange should not be extradited to the U.S. because Washington \u2019 s case against him is in fact politically motivated .\nIn this case , as a serving member of Congressman , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ solicitation of a deal automatically proves that there was direct US political involvement in advance of the Department of Justice \u2019 s 18 superceding indictments of Assange served this past summer .\nIn addition to this , the defense has proof of a CIA-led operation which spied on Assange in the Ecuadorian Embassy in London , which included surveillance of his discussions with his attorneys .\nTaken together , these two pieces of evidence could be crucial in the defense \u2019 s effort to have the US extradition request overturned on the basis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ motivated and therefore in violation the extradition treaty between the two countries .\nWikiLeaks tweeted out today that this Rohrabacker story will come into play on Tuesday \u2019 s session of the hearing .\nWikiLeaks also points out the issue of the timeline of events with this story \u2013 that the Rohrabacher meeting took place long after Assange had publicly stated that his source for the DNC leaks was not a sate actor .\nIn addition to this , former UK Ambassador and friend of Assange , Craig Murray , has also declared @ @ @ @ @ @ @ occasions that the source was not Russia , but from \u2018 Washington DC circles \u2019 .\nFrom Sputnik News : In December 2016 Murray told Radio Sputnik that the DNC Leaks had \u201c absolutely nothing to do with Russia \u201d .\nHe said that he discovered the source while attending a whistleblowing conference in the US and stressed that it came from \u201c official circles in Washington DC \u201d .\nThe hysterical way in which the mainstream media has spun this story , and the extreme politicization by the establishment \u2013 may also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ team .\nLastly , there is the question of whether or not the Dana Rohrabacher story will help , or hurt the credibility of Julian Assange and WikiLeaks .\nAs I have stated a number of times previously , the key to the DOJ case against Assange lies in the language in which they have reframed Assange and WikiLeaks from being a journalist and a press outlet , and instead labeled him as a \u2018 cyber terrorist and Russian asset \u2019 , and a \u2018 hostile non-state foreign intelligence service \u2019 , respectively @ @ @ @ @ @ @ US to strip Assange and WikiLeaks of any first Amendment protections upon arrival in the US , as well as justify Special Administrative Measures , which places Assange essentially in the same category as an enemy combatant or terrorist .\nOne way to make this reframing exercise more credible is by attacking the credibility of both Assange and WikiLeaks , to portray them as not acting like \u2018 conventional journalistic outlets , \u2019 simply to demonstrate that Assange and WikiLeaks are cavalier or careless in keeping to their journalistic principles .\nThis is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ might be used to undermine Julian Assange \u2019 s insistence that WikiLeaks protects their sources at all costs .\nThe insinuation by Rohrabacher \u2013 which has now cascaded through the world \u2019 s media \u2013 is that Assange was willing to sell-out his principles by divulging to Washington who leaked the DNC emails in order to save his own skin in the form of a pardon from President Trump .\n\u201c Upon my return , I spoke briefly with Gen. Kelly .\nI told him that Julian Assange would provide information about the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pardon.\n\u201d In his statement posted on Feb. 20 , 2020 , Rohrabacher was careful not to state explicitly that Assange had told him \u201c Yes \u201d and agreed to give up his source in exchange for a Presidential pardon \u2013 it was only inferred in Rohrabacher \u2019 s above quote , \u201c I told him that Julian Assange would provide information\u2026 \u201d \u2013 but he does not specify what exactly that information would be : a source , contextual information , deductive information , ie .\nwho it wasn \u2019 t , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rule out a Russian state actor .\nIt \u2019 s hard to know at this point , but that didn \u2019 t stop the mainstream media from colonizing that vacuum of information with the usual bevy of speculation , spin and fake news which we demonstrated earlier in this article .\nBut the general impression in all of the reporting and from the Congressman himself , is that Assange had told Rohrabacher he would indeed give up his source in exchange for a pardon .\nThis does not square with many vehement statements @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of WikiLeaks \u2019 sources .\nWho would really expect Assange to have have suffered this ten-year long ordeal \u2013 only to suddenly trust an emissary of the United States government to keep his promise to make good on some informal , and highly uncertain promise of freedom ?\nIt \u2019 s also worth noting here that this same narrative mirrors a story which has been circulating somewhat under the radar for months , about a former FOX News contributor named Ellen Ratner ( late brother Michael Ratner had been a U.S. lawyer for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Assange in the Ecuadorian Embassy in the fall of 2016 .\nClaims about her visit were then made by an alleged associate , another FOX News contributor and Dallas financial manager named Ed Butowsky \u2013 and Butowsky claims that Ratner told him that Assange said his source was the late Seth Rich , a DNC employee who was shot and killed a block from his apartment in Washington DC on July 10 , 2016 .\nThis of course infers , by extension , that Rich was murdered because he was the leaker .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ a few mainstream media outlets , but is more popular in alternative American conservative media .\nAll of this is purely speculative , and as yet , without any evidence to validate the theory .\nHowever , Butowsky \u2019 s third-hand claims have triggered a chain a lawsuits led by a libel suit filed by the family of Seth Rich against various parties and media outlets who made the claim that Rich leaked the DNC emails to WikiLeaks .\nRohrabacher also mentions Seth Rich on this statement made on his website : \u201c @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in getting this message through to the President I still call on him to pardon Julian Assange , who is the true whistleblower of our time .\nFinally , we are all holding our breath waiting for an honest investigation into the murder of Seth Rich.\n\u201d One has to also ask why , if Rohrabacher believed in Assange \u2019 s cause of press freedom and clear First Amendment implications for the American people should Assange be put on trial for doing journalism , that the Congressman has never canvased for the release @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years , but instead only dangles a private deal in front of Assange requiring him to give up his source ?\nThe amount of media noise surrounding this issue can easily obfuscate some of the fundamental principles and themes which are governing the mainstream narrative of this story .\nWhat \u2019 s important to note here is that just like Rohrabacher \u2019 s inference that Assange had agreed to provide information on the DNC leaks , Butowsky \u2019 s unfounded claim infers that Julian Assange gave up his source to Ellen Ratner \u2013 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he would never betray .\nAgain , such a narrative actually undermines the ethical and professional credibility and staunch reputation of Julian

traditional face to face meeting and offer of a pardon , a previous approach was said to have been made by the FBI and CIA agencies in 2017 , as reported by John Solomon in 2018 , whereby Assange

@ @ @ James Comey then intervened later in the process in order to kill the deal .\nThe Rohrabacher story is just one of many fascinating details which will be introduced during the process of Assange \u2019 s hearing which will take place in two parts ; in February , and then in May .\nBut with all of these details and revelations , readers should pay close attention to how and why the news is

role of government in their lives and their belief that government can fix anything , including their mortality , demonstrates the madness that inflicts people when they become impressed with some delusion and run after it .\nThe present response to the coronavirus has led to panic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reactions .\nActing upon incomplete and probably inaccurate information , our government has embarked upon a spending spree and encroachment on the liberties of Americans of massive proportions .\nLogic would dictate that from now on , every flu season , our economy must shut down and the government print , thereby inflating , more money and spend it on non-productive transfers .\nThe sphere of liberty shrinks as the size of government grows .\nThe current response to \u201c Chinese flu \u201d has led to policies unheard of in American history with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that government can cure anything ( pun intended ) , they are exhibiting symptoms of a disease far more serious than COVID-19 .\nIn slightly more than 200 years , Americans have moved away from self-reliance toward government dependence .\nOur history has been one of people demanding and expecting the government to leave them alone .\nNow , people are requiring the government to take care of them .\nBut at what cost ?\nBeing told that 1 million Montanans are under \u201c house arrest \u201d and that every \u201c non-essential \u201d @ @ @ @ @ @ @ irrational response to save the lives of a few .\nThe logic displayed during this current \u201c pandemic \u201d would necessitate that nothing ever be allowed that would put more than 1 percent of a given population at risk .\nSo , driving cars must be banned , no American lives can be risked defending freedom , and high cholesterol foods taken off the shelves

statistics such as case fatality ratios , irregularities in how deaths are recorded , and the dubious wisdom of lockdown measures .\nWe have also been covering the growing chorus of experts suggesting that COVID-19 may not be as deadly as feared .\nHowever , factors such as the number of COVID deaths and whether lockdowns work are totally dependent on other , more fundamental questions : How accurate are the tests being used ?\nWhat do they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ proven that this virus causes this disease ?\nIt may yet emerge that the very foundations of the MSM/government narrative \u2014 that the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus causes a disease called COVID-19 , and that tests for the virus will tell if you \u2019 re sick or not \u2014 have yet to be proven .\nConsider all that has happened since the beginning of this crisis : projections of millions dead , entire countries quarantined , unprecedented economic carnage , civil liberties tossed aside , the public in fear .\nWe are told there is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ salvation lies in contact tracing ( total surveillance ) , biometric immunity passports , and experimental vaccines currently being developed in great haste .\nThe total cost of this crisis will be at the very least tens of trillions of dollars , but the actual amount is in fact incalculable , and much of what will be lost can not be measured in dollars anyway .\nConsidering such a price tag , would it not be a good idea to prove the virus to be the cause of the disease first ?\nThere @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has a number of gaping holes in it , and a few voices are questioning the underlying assumptions upon which the entire coronavirus crisis is based .\nThe following article by Jon Rappoport looks at a scientific paper by researcher David Crowe that does just that .\nOur political leaders say they are \u201c guided by the science \u201d , but talk is cheap .\nUntil these fundamental questions are answered , whatever those leaders are doing is not based on sound

.\nI \u2019 m talking about , for example , the mainstream claims of discovering new viruses .\nCrowe doesn \u2019 t lay on vague brushstrokes .\nHe goes to the core of fabrications and exposes them ,

@ @ @ @ @ @ a new virus which they assert is the cause of a new pandemic , COVID-19 ?\nAt the end of this article , I list the published papers Crowe refers to by number , as he takes apart the very basis of the COVID illusion .\nDavid Crowe : \u201c Scientists are detecting novel RNA in multiple patients with pneumonia-like conditions , and are assuming that the detection of RNA ( which is believed to be wrapped in proteins to form an RNA virus , as coronaviruses are believed to be ) is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It is not , and one of the groups of scientists was honest enough to admit this \u201d : \u201c \u2019 we did not perform tests for detecting infectious virus in blood \u2019 \u201d [ 2 ] \u201c But , despite this admission , earlier in the paper they repeatedly referred to the 41 cases ( out of 59 similar cases ) that tested positive for this RNA as , \u2018 41 patients\u2026confirmed to be infected with 2019-nCoV \u2019 .\n\u201d \u201c Koch \u2019 s postulates , first stated by the great German @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , can simply be stated as \u201d : \u201c * Purify the pathogen ( e.g .\nvirus ) from many cases with a particular illness .\n* Expose susceptible animals ( obviously not humans ) to the pathogen .\n* Verify that the same illness is produced .\n* Some add that you should also re-purify the pathogen , just to be sure that it really is creating the illness.\n\u201d \u201c Famous virologist Thomas Rivers stated in a 1936 speech , \u2018 It is obvious that Koch \u2019 s postulates have not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ That was a long time ago , but the same problem still continues .\nNone of the papers referenced in this article have even attempted to purify the virus .\nAnd the word \u2018 isolation \u2019 has been so debased by virologists it means nothing ( e.g .\nadding impure materials to a cell culture and seeing cell death is \u2018 isolation \u2019 ) .\n\u201d \u201c Reference [ 1 ] did publish electron [ microscope ] micrographs , but it can clearly be seen in the lesser magnified photo , that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ purified as the quantity of material that is cellular is much greater .\nThe paper notes that the photos are from \u2018 human airway epithelial cells \u2019 .\nAlso consider that the photo included in the article will certainly be the \u2018 best \u2019 photo , i.e .\nthe one with the greatest number of particles .\nLab technicians may be encouraged to spend hours to look around to find the most photogenic image , the one that most looks like pure virus.\n\u201d \u201c There is no way to tell that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ PCR test is

gatherings have been happening since 1954 , amid spotty and usually tepid mainstream news coverage that typically scoffs at Bilderberg \u2019 s significance and fails to reveal Bilderberg \u2019 s status as a world planning and networking cabal that helps build technological , financial , informational and political frameworks for unaccountable global governance and deep-state machinations .\nThe confirmation of Hick \u2019 s hearing from a commission staffer was secured by World Impact News ( WIN ) May 18\u2014following an extended period @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would be dismissed .\nThe most recent proposed hearing date was April 28 , following other delays in a probe that stems back to about mid-2019 .\nThe June 4 date appears to be a \u201c go \u201d and will take place at 9 a.m.

and released in November 2019 stopped short of drawing conclusions , the report looks into a total of 5 trips that Hickenlooper took , apparently on private planes , in 2018 while he was still governor , with considerable emphasis on his June 2018 trip to the Bilderberg Meeting .\nThe ethics complaint was filed by former Republican Speaker of the Colorado State House Frank McNulty , who

Hickenlooper \u201c illegally accepted luxury hotel accommodations and expensive travel expenses from corporations.\n\u201d The remaining trips being probed besides Hick \u2019 s Bilderberg attendance in Italy include his August 2018 attendance at the Bilderberg-connected American Enterprise Institute \u2019 s ( AEI ) Jackson Hole Symposium ( AEI has at times has sent representatives to the

for warmaking and other hostile actions .\nThere \u2019 s plenty about Trump and his predecessors to criticize .\nThe same goes for key officials advising them .\nUS domestic policy is all about benefitting corporate America and high-net-worth individuals at the expense of social justice , government serving all its people equitably .\nThroughout US history , its geopolitical agenda has been

making the world less stable and safe .\nAnd of course the US war budget is never too big for hawks like Bolton and never enough wars on humanity to suit them .\nBolton \u2019 s Sunday interview @ @ @

elected President of the Republic ) and his Justice and Development Party ( or AKP ) have for the whole of the 21st century ( with the notable exception of this millennium when the party had not yet

with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ policy of Sunnification .\nThis denomination primarily functions to distinguish AKP-led Turkey from Kemalist Turkey ( 1923-2002 ) , a country built upon the principle of nationalism and contingent upon the idea that progress and modernisation are but a natural consequence of Westernisation .\nStill , this supposedly \u2018 new \u2019 political entity \u2013 the New Turkey \u2013 is very much hinged on the nation state Turkey that emerged following the end of the Great War ( aka World War I , 1914-18 ) and the Turkish War of Liberation ( 1919-22 ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Kemal Pa\u015fa ( 1881-1938 ) .\nThe latter war was concluded by the Treaty of Lausanne that was signed on 24 July 1923 , and less than three months later , Mustafa Kemal ( later universally known as Atat\u00fcrk ) established the Republic of Turkey on the ruins of the Ottoman State ( 29 October 1923 ) .\nAnd that means that the centenary is but three years away now \u2013 1923-2023 .\nBut this year , in 2020 \u2013 that strange and awkward time frame when the world , including the New @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the coronavirus hysteria and its deadly companion known only as Covid-19 \u2013 the 97th anniversary of the signing of this legal document was marked by another anniversary and another momentous event .\nFor the Ayasofya Museum was turned into a mosque again on that very day this year .\nThe Hagia Sophia ( or the Church of the Holy Wisdom , dedicated on 26 December 537 ) , was originally built by Emperor Justinian ( 527-65 ) .\nFollowing the Ottoman conquest of Constantinople ( 29 May 1453 ) , the building @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the orders of Sultan Mehmed II ( popularly knows as Fatih or the Conqueror , 1451-81 ) .\nAnd 86 years ago , this mosque had become a museum as a result of Atat\u00fcrk \u2019 s personal intervention .\nThis year , on the very day that commemorates the signature of a treaty Kemalists used to call the Turkish Republic \u2019 s \u201c foundation document , \u201d the mosque that Fatih inaugurated became a living and breathing Muslim place of worship once again .\nThe Islamist Perspective : Mustafa Kemal as the Enemy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would like to point out that Islamists , and particularly Turkish ones , love to hate Atat\u00fcrk .\nAnd in the present context , the status of the Ayasofya as a museum ( 1934-2020 ) acts as nothing but an architectural and institutional symbol of Turkey \u2019 s founding father \u2013 a building and an institution that have come to encapsulate all the disgust and hatred felt by Turkish Islamists for the figure loved and adored by millions throughout the years .\nFor , the Mosque of Ayasofya occupied a special spot in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of worship where the Ottoman Sultan himself attended Friday Prayers , as the one Imperial Mosque that had not been built by an Ottoman patron but that had instead been acquired by sheer force and violence ( summarised in the Turkish phrase K\u0131l\u0131\u00e7 Hakk\u0131 , that can be translated as the \u2018 Right of the Sword \u2019 ) .\nAs a result , in Ottoman times , the population looked to the Ayasofya for guidance , where the sermons delivered on Fridays carried special meaning , as the figure of the preacher had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ given to a member of the brotherhood ( or Tarikat ) of the Halvetiyye , favoured by the House of Osman and characterised by its adherence to the Sharia and the example of the Prophet ( the Sunnah ) .\nIn other words , this building that had been a church for 916 ( 537-1453 ) years had become a living and breathing embodiment of Ottoman Islam ( 1453-1934 or 481 years ) .\nAnd Atat\u00fcrk summarily brought an end to that sacred tradition .\nThe conversion of the Ayasofya was but one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lead to outright hatred and revulsion .\nFollowing its foundation , the Turkish Republic quickly tried very hard to rid itself of any and all ill-smelling Ottoman remains and other supposedly sickly whiffs emanating from Muslim habits and institutions : on 1 November 1922 , ( following the conclusion of the War of Independence [ 1919-22 ] and prior to the foundation of the Republic even ) , the Turkish Parliament ( or TBMM , that had been supervising the war effort ) abolished the sultanate and two years later , in full @ @ @ @ @ @ @ confined the caliphate to the dustbin of history as well ( 3 March 1924 ) .\nThis last suppression also included the abrogation of the Ministry of Pious Endowments and the office of \u015eeyh\u00fclslam ( the Sheikh-ul-Islam or head of the religious institution in the Ottoman State who oversaw the B\u00e2b-\u0131 Me\u015f\u00eehat ) only to replace the latter with a Directorate of Religious Affairs ( colloquially known as the Diyanet ) .\nThe next year , dervish brotherhoods ( called Tarikat and somewhat analogous to Christian orders , such as the Dominicans , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Ottoman headgear called Fes ( introduced by Mahmud II in 1828 ) joined the ranks of discarded institutions and items .\nInstead now , the government and its officials started encouraging the wholesale adoption of Western-style clothing , including hats , and not just for men but also for women .\nAnd this meant that the Turkish state ended up promoting a termination of the Islamic custom of veiling women and segregating the sexes .\nThe people by and large either enthusiastically adapted to these changes or merely acquiesced .\nBut , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we just say Islamists or purists ) were particularly upset by 1924 \u2019 s abolition of the Caliphate , for loyalty to the Caliph in Istanbul had been the rallying cry to unite Anatolia \u2019 s divergent Muslim population groups in the fight against the occupiers ( 1919-22 ) .\nYet now , now that the war was won , Mustafa Kemal turned against his erstwhile patron and deprived Muslims worldwide of their one and only spiritual figurehead : on 4 January 1925 , the Naqshbandi Sheikh Said issued a fetva against the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Republic \u2013 the fetva accused Mustafa Kemal of destroying religion and made it incumbent upon every believer to take up arms against the godless government in Ankara .\nAs these events had taken place in the remote southeast of the country ( largely occupied by Kurds , which is why many Kurds and Kurdophiles alike see this rising as linked to Kurdish nationalism rather than religious sentiment ) , the TBMM only became aware of the rising by late February .\nThe Naqshi-led rebels were by that stage threatening the city @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Amed ) , and as a consequence the government dispatched the army to suppress the insurrection , leading to approximately 20,000 casualties .\nOn 27 April 1925 , the Turkish army captured the ringleader .\nAlready on the 4th of March , the TBMM had promulgated the \u2018 Law on the Maintenance of Order \u2019 ( or Takrir-i S\u00fckun Kanunu ) , re-established the so-called \u2018 Independence Tribunals \u2019 ( \u0130stiklal Mahkemeleri , originally set up on 26 September 1920 as part of the ongoing war effort ) .\nOn 28 June 1925 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sheikh Said and 47 of his accomplices to death .\nThe executions were carried out the next day .\nAs a side-note , it is worth remarking that Ankara \u2019 s current AKP-led government has renamed Diyarbak\u0131r \u2019 s town square , the \u015eeyh Said Meydan\u0131 and , much more ominously , one should note that the current political elite ruling the country and its whole political apparatus has its roots firmly lodged deep inside the Naqshbandi organisation .\nThe Takrir-i S\u00fckun Kanunu ( or \u2018 Law on the Maintenance of Order \u2019 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1929 .\nThis meant that the Republic of Turkey was effectively governed by an emergency legislation for the duration of four years .\nAnd , as I have stated elsewhere , in \u201c these four years the most drastic reforms were introduced by the government.\n\u201d Following the disappearance of the institution of the Caliphate and its last incumbent ( Halife Abd\u00fclmecid Efendi , 1868\u20131944 ) \u2019 s expulsion from the country , the Ankara government clearly felt more at ease and proceeded to abolish Sharia law in 1926 .\nIn the next @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Law codex regulating human actions and social relations with the so-called Kanun-\u0131 Medini , itself a copy of the Swiss Code civil .\nAlso in 1926 , Turks ( or rather Muslim citizens ) also received legal access to alcohol , a gesture that ensured that Turks could now enjoy delights reserved for the next world to other Muslims .\nIn the next world ( or Cennet or Paradise ) , the consumption of wine is allowed and even encouraged .\nThe Quranic Sura XLVII:15 speaks of the rivers of Paradise , including @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the drinkers \u2019 .\nThe following year , the government ordered the removal of Ottoman tu\u011fra \u2019 s ( calligraphic imperial cyphers ) from public buildings ( 5 May 1927 ) .\nOn 1 November 1928 , then , the Arabic script was officially replaced by a new Latin-based alphabet .\nIn the same year , Turkish lawmakers also proceeded to amend the Constitution , in place since 1924 , by means of removing the phrase \u2018 The Religion of the Turkish State is Islam \u2019 from its second article .\nThese @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their state religion ( a conceptual twosome expressed in the commonly used Ottoman phrase Din \u00fc Devlet or \u2018 Religion and State \u2019 ) from public view .\nIn the first years of the 1930s , the final finishing touches were put into place : the call to prayer and all Quranic recitations were to be executed in Turkish ( 1933 , this custom was abolished in 1950 with the advent of the Demokrat Parti , following the introduction of multi-party democracy ) ; next now largely unveiled Turkish women received the right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ finally , Sunday , the weekday Christians employ to commemorate the resurrection of Jesus by celebrating the Eucharist , became Turkey \u2019 s legal weekly holiday , taking the place of the Muslim holy day of Friday .\nIn short .\n\u201c the Kemalist reforms literally altered the face of Turkey , \u201d as expressed by the eminent historian Erik Z\u00fcrcher .\nIn Ottoman times , Turkey ( as the \u2018 Ottomans \u2019 cherished homeland \u2019 was called by \u2018 nearly everybody , \u2019 attested by K\u00e2z\u0131m Nami [ Duru ] , 1876-1967 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) had looked like a typical Islamic country , with an abundance of veiled women , popular mosque attendance and the conspicuous absence of alcoholic beverages , among the most eye-catching Muslim sights .\nMustafa Kemal and his parliament also ensured that future generations of Turks would basically be cut off from their own history as well as from the nation \u2019 s historical record .\nIn addition , the newly introduced Latin alphabet would also make direct access to Islam \u2019 s holy book all but impossible .\nIn this way , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ following the introduction of surnames in 1934 ) had put conditions in place meant to secure Turkey \u2019 s further development as a nation state along Western lines .\nIn fact , in 1937 , the journalist \u00d6mer Kemal A\u011far ( 1901-87 ) proudly proclaimed that now \u201c there is no difference anymore between the European and us.\n\u201d And for that reason , Turkish Islamists ( traditionally called gerici or regressives adhering to irtica [ or religious reaction ] in Kemalist parlance ) despise Atat\u00fcrk , as they fully agree with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and condemn Turkey \u2019 s founding father as a veritable enemy of Islam .\nNow turning directly to the architectural and institutional symbol that has been the Ayasofya Museum for the past 86 years .\nFollowing the War of Liberation ( 1919-22 ) and the foundation of the Republic ( 1925 ) , the erstwhile church that Justinian built continued to operate as a mosque , as one of the many mosques dotting Istanbul \u2019 s urban landscape .\nIn Turkey , a great deal of conspiracy theories have been floated over the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ building suddenly became a museum \u2013 ranging from a forged Atat\u00fcrk signature to a geopolitical interpretation in the context of Soviet Russia and neighbouring Greece .\nThe reality though seems much more mundane and down to interpersonal relationships and interactions \u2013 between Atat\u00fcrk and Thomas Whittemore ( 1871-1950 ) , to be precise .\nThe latter was a Massachusetts-born American who has \u201c donned many hats throughout his life\u2014both literally and figuratively \u201d and whom the Harvard University research institute Dumbarton Oaks \u2019 website describes as an \u201c academic , amateur archaeologist , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ today best remembered \u201c for founding the Byzantine Institute , an organization that specialized in the study , restoration , and conservation of Byzantine art and architecture , in 1930.\n\u201d And more importantly , in June 1931 , his personal interaction with Mustafa Kemal led the Turkish government to grant the Institute permission to \u201c uncover and restore the original mosaics in Hagia Sophia , which had been covered in Islamic motifs since the church was converted into a mosque by the Ottoman Turks , in 1453.\n\u201d And in this context @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anecdote : \u201c Santa Sophia was a mosque the day that I talked to him .\nThe next morning , when I went to the mosque , there was a sign on the door written in Atat\u00fcrk \u2019 s own hand .\nIt said : \u2018 The museum is closed for repairs \u2019 .\n\u201d This short anecdote may very well be fanciful or aprocryphal , but following the American specialists \u2019 work on site , having uncovered hitherto quite unseen mosaics and frescoes , the then-Minister of Education Abidin \u00d6zmen ( 1890-1966 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ogan ( 1888-1956 ) , the director of Istanbul \u2019 s Museums of Antiquities ( or \u00c2s\u00e2r-\u0131 Atika M\u00fczeleri , today Archaeology Musuems ) on 25 August 1934 \u2013 a letter instructing the latter to commence the arrangements to convert the mosque into a museum .\nIn the wake of these preparations , Turkey \u2019 s Council of Ministers ( then known as the Vekiller Heyeti ) officially desacralised the Ayasofya Mosque on 24 November 1934 .\nThis official document bears the signature of Mustafa Kemal Atat\u00fcrk , in addition to those of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Minipsters : These Kemalist politicians acted in accordance with their modernist beliefs that progress could only be achieved through modernisation as Westernisation , though the wording clearly shows they still considered Turkey to be part and parcel of the \u201c Oriental World \u201d ( \u2018 \u015eark alemi \u2019 ) .\nIt is also significant to point out that the Council of Ministers \u2019 document does not mention the Ayasofya \u2019 s extraordinary location in the Ottomans \u2019 religious life , instead specifically referring to \u201c this mosque \u201d as a \u201c work @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Byzantines.\n\u201d Rather than regarding or classifying the building as housing a living and breathing house of worship , as Atat\u00fcrk and his ministers had already effectively confined the Ottomans to the past as veritable museum pieces , they understood the Ayasofya ( or the Hagia Sophia ) solely as an impressive work of art that had been created by the \u201c Byzantines , \u201d and latterly appropriated by the Ottomans for their own purposes .\nIn this way , they clearly regarded their \u201c conversion of the Ayasofya mosque .\n.\n.\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ befitting a modern and forward-looking state , a state not hampered by religious superstition or backward-looking beliefs and practices .\nFrom Mosque to Museum to Tourist Attraction Conservative Turks and Islamist opponents of the Ankara regime took Atat\u00fcrk \u2019 s action regarding the most important mosque in the erstwhile Ottoman lands as a personal affront .\nRather than seeing this as a natural progression towards a modern and contemporary society , the Ayasofya conversion came to signify the extent to which Mustafa Kemal had led his people astray , away from the the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( or a\u1e63-\u1e62ir\u0101\u1e6d al-mustaq\u012bm or the s\u0131r\u00e2t-\u0131 m\u00fcstak\u00eem ) .\nAs a result , the issue of the Ayasofya was to become a festering wound over time , a constant source of grief and anger for many pious Turks and even zealous Muslims abroad .\nBut in the West , these concerns seemed very unreal , and the museum quickly became a popular tourist attraction .\nAs a building complex , the Ayasofya had accrued a lot Ottoman additions over the years , with the building of a number of domed tombs ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( \u015fad\u0131rvan ) the most visible elements that the government was not able to either hide or erase .\nEqually , on the inside , the giant roundells bearing calligraphic rendition of the names of the Prophet and the four Rightly-Guided Caliphs , added in the 19th century , were not removed either .\nBut , on the whole , following the conversion to a museum , the church that Justinian built was basically returned to its original form : the \u201c present edifice is essentially that of Justinian \u2019 s reign , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ guide Strolling through Istanbul , first published in 1972 .\nThe contemporary Byzantine chronicler Procopius of Caesarea ( ca 500-70 ) wrote down the following impression : In the next decade , UNESCO , a specialised agency of the United Nations aimed at contributing \u201c to the building of peace , the eradication of poverty , sustainable development and intercultural dialogue through education , the sciences , culture , communication and information , \u201d promoted the \u201c most glorious \u201d Hagia Sophia to the position of a world heritage site ( 1985 ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Islam was on the rise in Turkey , and the charismatic and hugely popular Islamist Necmetin Erbakan ( 1926-2011 ) craftily employed the mention of the Ayasofya as a rallying cry to rouse the masses during his always more than well-attended public speeches .\nFollowing the sudden electoral victory of his Refah Partisi ( or RP , erroneously translated as Welfare Party ) in 1994 on a nationwide local level , the topic of reverting the museum into a mosque anew became a lively and widely debated topic of discussion in Turkey and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ became the RP Mayor of Istanbul ( 27 March 1994 ) and the following day , the start of the working week or Monday , small groups of young men ostentatiously dressed up in Islamic garb could be seen congregating in front of the Ayasofya Museum , talking to passers-by and attempting to convince them that the building should become a mosque again .\nAs the fist Islamist Mayor of Istanbul , Erdo\u011fan was not shy about starting a charm campaign to impress Muslims worldwide .\nThe self-styled \u2018 magazine of Muslims around @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sent their reporter Mohammad Al-Abbasi to conduct an interview with the then-rising start of political Islam in Turkey , Tayyip Erdo\u011fan ( published on 26 April 1994 ) .\nIn the course of the conversation , the newly-appointed Mayor of Istanbul told the reporter that \u201c the Ayasofya will return as a mosque for Muslims.\n\u201d In other words , the topic may not always have been on the forefront of news cycles or in the public discourse of the land , but the fire of hatred that Atat\u00fcrk had unleashed kept burning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Anniversary of the Treaty of Lausanne : The Restoration of the Ayasofya It took Tayyip Erdo\u011fan 26 years to exact his revenge on Atat\u00fcrk , but in the end he kept his word and with a grand ceremony held on the highly symbolic date of 24 July , the museum was turned into a mosque again \u2013 what Erbakan had promised , Erdo\u011fan finally delivered .\nOn 10 July 2020 , a \u201c Turkish court [ had preliminary ] cleared the way for the Hagia Sophia to be converted from a museum back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who is now the Prez took hold of this opportunity to address the nation once more : \u201c The Council of State [ known today as the Dan\u0131\u015ftay ] today annulled the 1934 Cabinet Decree which had enabled the Ayasofya \u2019 s conversion from a mosque to a museum .\nBased on that ruling we have issued a presidential decree to facilitate the reopening of the Ayasfoya Mosque .\nThus , after 86 years the Ayasfoya will be able to start serving as a mosque once again as stated in the foundation charter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wish this decision to be auspicious to our nation , the ummah , and all of humanity .\nOur Ministry of Culture and Tourism has immediately begun to work on the administrative and technical preparations with our Presidency of Religious Affairs on religious aspects of the matter.\n\u201d And the date chosen to conduct the solemn re-inauguration of the erstwhile premier mosque in the Ottoman lands was a Friday , and that Friday Prayer took place on the day the Treaty of Lausanne was signed in 1923 \u2013 the document that led the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Turkey , arguably Mustafa Kemal [ Atat\u00fcrk ] \u2019 s greatest achievement .\nIn order to ensure the message wouldn \u2019 t get lost in the general rejoicing and festive atmosphere , the government closed down the Turkish Consulate in Thessaloniki , which just happens to be the house ( new museum ) where Turkey \u2019 s founding father was born in 1881 .\nIn Istanbul , the honour of delivering the Friday sermon ( Khutbah or Hutbe ) in the Ayasofya was given to Dr Ali Erba\u015f , the Director of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) .\nErba\u015f , is currently a close favourite of Erdo\u011fan \u2019

\u015eeyh\u00fclislam ) to the President of the Republic , whom many accuse of acting like a dictator or a latter-day sultan .\nIn order to deliver his Hutbe , the slight Erba\u015f climbed the steps of the pulpit ( minbar or minber ) clasping a sword in his right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ though the Ayasofya had not been built as a mosque , the Ottomans had rightfully converted the Hagia Sophia into the Ayasofya by means of the \u2018 Right of the Sword \u2019 ( K\u0131l\u0131\u00e7 Hakk\u0131 ) .\nAli Erba\u015f started off in a somewhat conciliatory mood : \u201c The longing of our nation , which has turned into a heartbreak , is coming to an end today.\n\u201d He then took a scenic route only to end his words with a deadly insult and curse : Dr Ali Erba\u015f spoke about the Ottoman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most glorious \u201d Church of the Holy Wisdom to turn it into the premier mosque of the land .\nBut then he used a sentence construction couched in logic to actually curse Turkey \u2019 s founding father .\nHolding a sword in his hand , the man now acting as the Sheikh-ul-Islam of the New Turkey condemned the nation \u2019 s founding father Mustafa Kemal Atat\u00fcrk : As if the re-dedication of the Ayasofya Mosque were but the opening move of the ultimate destruction and deconstruction of the nation state that Mustafa Kemal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hutbe , Dr Erba\u015f used the word \u201c ilelebet \u201d or \u2018 forever \u2019 in connection with the Ayasofya , and the use of this word is also direct slight in the direction of Atat\u00fcrk .\nOne of the founding father \u2019 s most popular and oft-repeated phrases employs the same word , a word that is not at all in common usage anymore in contemporary Turkey : \u201c One day my mortal body will turn to dust , but the Turkish Republic will stand forever [ or ilelebet ] .\n\u201d The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Ayasofya Mosque , as a symbol for the AKP-led New Turkey , will remain forever , while Mustafa Kemal \u2019 s remains have all but turned to dust , just like his nation state will turn into dust as well .\nCountdown to 2023 : The Centenary to End the Republic As long ago as 2013 , I wrote that some people in

Turkey into an Anatolian federation of Muslim ethnicities , possibly linked to a revived caliphate \u201d and the renewed implementation of Sharia law .\nAnd in the aftermath of the re-dedication , Islamist publications in Turkey have immediately jumped on this scenario , particularly on the possibility that the Prez could now rightfully claim a new and truly global caliphate .\nFor , Tayyip Erdo\u011fan has now replaced Atat\u00fcrk , who had turned the Ottomans into artifacts confined to museums devoid of any link to the living reality @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in turn , has succeeded in reviving the Ottomans ( albeit devoid of any real link with the Ottoman family or dynasty , but largely as a pseudo-Ottoman project to bring about the revival of Sunni Islam in Turkey ) and transforming the Ayasofya Museum into a real mosque again .\nSome months following his election victory in 1994 Erdo\u011fan , accompanied by his then-mentor Erbakan and his then-still friend and brother-in-arms Abdullah G\u00fcl , flew to the Belgian city of Antwerp , where the the prominent Naqshbandi Sheikh Naz\u0131m-\u0131 K\u0131brsi ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crowd mainly consisting of Turkish immigrant workers

and now-President of the Republic has all but succeeded in accomplishing that goal .\nAs I wrote last year , \u201c the centenary of the Republic \u2019 s foundation in 2023 seems like the ideal

to frisk citizens , demand identification , search their cars and use their weapons and force if needed.\n\u201d Arguably , these newly-created neighborhood watchmen are thus in an ideal position to

demanding for the implementation of Sharia law in the land .\nThe re-dedication of the Ayasofya Mosque marks the starting shot of the countdown to 2023 .\n.\n.\nwhich will be the year the world will

over then candidate Trump \u2019 s Middle East policy slate and would ultimately go on to shape his Administration \u2019 s position on Palestine and Israel .\nThe true extent of Adelson \u2019 s influence was realized upon the appointment of neocon John Bolton as the President \u2019 s National Security Advisor and the commitment to an aggressive and hawkish position versus Iran \u2013 one which would eventually drag the US and the region @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 2019 .\nBut things may be going sour between the two camps .\nCertainly , Israeli PM Benjamin Netanyahu \u2019 s back-to-back election

some news that could turn out to be vital to peace in the Middle East over the next few months .\nToward the end of a report on Trump \u2019 s bizarre press conference/campaign rally at his private

off the attack at the last minute , concerned that it might kill 150 Iranians .\nBolton ( who Trump appointed apparently to please Adelson ) was disgusted , but the episode may show that the president

conclusions about the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ policy ?\nAdelson \u2019 s warmongering pro-Israel views are no secret ; he has even called for \u201c an atomic weapon \u201d to be fired at Iran .\nIf a

Biden \u2019 s frequent and increasingly noticeable gaffes has given way to the trending hashtag # CognitiveDecline .\nAnd it \u2019 s no longer laughing matter .\nAt the age of 77 , Biden is by far the oldest Presidential candidate in American history .\nIf he does manage to get elected in November , he would be 78 by the time of inauguration \u2013 a full eight years older that the next oldest US President to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , sworn in at 70 yrs old .\nThe next oldest was Ronald Reagan , a mere 69 yrs old back in 1980 , a veriable spring chicken in comparison to Biden .\nBy now , Trump \u2019 s constant stream of gaffes and invectives are widely written off as being the byproduct of extreme ignorance combined with a galactic narcissistic complex .\nBut Biden \u2019 s slippage is something else altogether , and looks like it could be genuine cerebral impairment .\nAs a result , his campaign is fast becoming a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very sad and almost macabre about it \u2013 how the party and its media adjuncts can allow such a disintegrating situation to carry on .\nIn all of his \u2018 virtual \u2019 campaign appearances , Biden has exhibited incoherent outbursts , and nonsensical ramblings , as well as an inability to finish sentences .\nThere isn \u2019 t very much to conclude here other than the Democratic Party \u2019 s choice of leadership seems to be experiencing a clear mental decay , not dissimilar to the early stage alzheimers according to some mainstream @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not as if this situation has just sprung out of nowhere .\nBiden \u2019 s cognitive decline was visible from before the Democratic primaries .\nAs recently as late June , a national poll conducted by Rasmussen showed that nearly 40 percent of registered American voters believed that the former Vice President has \u201c some form of dementia.\n\u201d Whether this is actually the case or not is a question for his doctors , but the fact that so many Americans believe he is unfit should raise alarm bells for Democrats .\nThere @ @ @ @ @ @ @ play .\nBased on his present mental performance , it \u2019 s possible that Biden may not be able to complete his first term in office , which means that whichever female he chooses as his Vice Presidential running mate \u2013 Susan Rice , Kamala Harris , Gretchen Whitmer , or anyone else \u2013 could end up assuming the office of US President within 12 months .\nThat means that the election in November is not Trump vs Biden , but rather Trump vs Biden \u2019 s VP pick .\nThis realization alone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ especially if Biden \u2019 s back-up really has no real mandate at all to sit at the helm of chief executive of the country .\nHow long until the mainstream media and Democratic Party leadership ( or the Biden campaign itself ) openly address this potentially unstable situation ?\nColumnist Miranda Devine from the New York Post writes\u2026 He might be riding high in the polls , but Joe Biden \u2019 s mental acuity increasingly is an issue in the election campaign , and growling at reporters who ask about it is no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ during an event with the National Associations of Black and Hispanic Journalists if

think ?\nHuh ?\nAre you a junkie ?\n\u201d said Biden in an interview to be streamed Thursday .\nOuch .\nBarnett had hit a nerve , and Biden \u2019 s flash of anger was a reminder of his interview in May with a black man , radio host Charlamagne tha God , when Biden blurted out the ruinous line that if you vote for Trump , \u201c you ain \u2019 t black.\n\u201d This time , Biden \u2019 s startling go-to defense was to accuse a black man of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Biden appeared to look at something slightly to the left of the camera , suddenly laughed heartily , apropos of nothing , and nodded his head twice .\nMaybe a staffer was frantically waving cue cards behind the camera or flashing a warning through the teleprompter .\nWhatever was going on , Biden recovered his composure and delivered a sharp line about President Trump and the cognitive test the commander-in-chief recently boasted about acing .\n\u201c If he [ Trump ] can \u2019 t figure out the difference between an elephant and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know what the hell he \u2019 s talking about , \u201d says Biden .\nPhew , crisis averted .\nOr it would have been if Biden hadn \u2019 t kept talking .\n\u201c Look , c \u2019 mon , man .\nI know you \u2019 re trying to goad me , but I \u2019 m so forward-looking to have an opportunity to sit with the president \u2014 or stand with the president \u2014 in debates.\n\u201d It is an

campaigner .\nMake @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chosen by popular acclaim .\nHe was anointed by the Democratic Party \u2019 s new kingmaker , Barack Obama .\nWith the Clintons consigned to history , Biden is Obama

.\nSergey gave people the opportunity to speak up .\nThey @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they feel , what they think about Belarus .\nPeople talked about their difficult life and dreamed of living in a free and rich country .\nI was amazed at how scared the authorities were .\nPeople began to be threatened , fired from their jobs , and thrown into prisons .\nIt turned out that the opportunity to speak out can wake up society .\nWhen Sergei was deprived of the opportunity to participate in the elections , having unjustly accused and arrested him , I decided to replace him and go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my husband , for all of us , for our children .\nAs a wife , as a mother , I understand that in a family one for all and all for one .\nI want it to be the same in our country.\n\u201d That \u2019 s how it begins , then moves on to what she would like for Belarus to become in the future .\nI want to become the President of the Republic of Belarus , but not for the sake of a position , but in order to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We are building a country not only for ourselves , but also for our children .\nI want our children to receive a good education , medical care , so that they can find a good job , start a family and have their own home .\nSo that they stay to live here , on their land , and not want to leave in search of a freer and more just country .\nI want us to feel love and respect for ourselves , have the right to choose and be proud @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I want Belarus to be respected in the world , so that we look for friends , not enemies .\nI want to see the vile tradition of persecuting people for the truth become a thing of the past.\n\u201d Then she looks into the National Policy which was constructed with the assistance of Victor Babariko and Valery Tsepkalo , as well as \u201c the best experts , parties and public organizations.\n\u201d Babariko and Tsepkalo had a website , which contained the National Policy , but it appears to be gone now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Web Archive .\nTsikhanovskaya linked the website in her campaign website \u2013 essentially the National Policy wasn \u2019 t even part of her own campaign , but a link to an outside , third party website , as it was likely made by individuals outside of her campaign party .\nThe main directions of reforming the existing state policy are : withdrawal from integration associations with the participation of Russia ; preservation and development of the national cultural heritage , the Belarusian language ; sustainable economic growth ; high level and quality of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ government .\nBelow are the issues that the improved national security needs to deal with : To implement its revisionist , imperial plans , the Kremlin is actively using : \u2022 toxic effects on the elite and society , \u2022 falsification of history in order to manipulate the public consciousness , The Russian leadership is using the concept of \u201c Russian peace \u201d to strengthen Moscow \u2019 s control over Belarus .\nThe basis for this is often the Russian language and the Russian Orthodox Church .\nThe Kremlin is actively using soft @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the media , bloggers , social networks , exchanges and internships in Russia .\n\u2022 Lack of democracy , freedom of speech , freedom of assembly and other basic freedoms .\nIndependent media is under severe pressure .\nCivil society and the political opposition face severe restrictions on their activities and persecution .\nThere have been no free and fair elections in the country for more than two decades .\n\u2022 Low level of national consciousness and dominance of the Russian language .\nThe complete inability of state ideologues and state media @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Russian media : Russian television and radio actually dominate the information field of Belarus .\n\u2022 The problematic state of the Belarusian economy .\nThe Belarusian economy is facing significant depreciation of fixed assets and technological backwardness not only from world leaders but also from its neighbors \u2013 the EU .\n\u2022 Membership of Belarus in integration supranational entities , dominated by Russia \u2013 the Union State , the CSTO , the EurAsEC , the CIS .\nAs part of the CSTO , Belarusians are threatened with involvement in armed conflicts in Central @ @ @ @ @ @ @ participation in the CSTO , there is a threat of the use of Asian or Russian troops in our territory .\nBelonging to the CSTO also hinders the modernization of the army .\n\u2022 Changing priorities and emphases in the foreign policy of the European Union .\nThe EU is facing unprecedented migration challenges and the consequences of Brexit .\nMany EU countries are looking for compromises with the Kremlin .\nThe United States is not a real guarantor of Belarus \u2018 independence , despite progress in bilateral relations and Washington \u2019 s @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sovereignty .\nFollowing are the main goals and objectives of the reform : The main goal of reforming the national security sector is the immediate mobilization and consolidation of society in order to protect independence and sovereignty .\n\u2022 unification of society on the basis of democratic values \u200b\u200band the idea of \u200b\u200bbuilding an independent Belarus ; \u2022 reduction of the Kremlin \u2019 s influence on Belarus through informational , economic , integration and humanitarian factors ; This will all be implemented with the following steps : \u2022 withdrawal from the \u201c Union @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Customs Union and other integration entities dominated by Russia ; \u2022 banning pro-Russian organizations whose activities run counter to national interests , as well as Russian foundations and organizations that fund such structures ; \u2022 criminalization of public statements challenging the existence of a separate Belarusian nation and / or its historical right to its own state .\nIntroduction of criminal liability for public insults to the Belarusian language ; \u2022 monitoring by civil society forces of pro-Kremlin initiatives in Belarus ; \u2022 border and customs control on the border with Russia @ @ @ @ @ @ @ infrastructure facilities to Russian companies .\n\u2022 liberation of independent media from state pressure and control , ensuring media freedom and freedom of speech in Belarus ; \u2022 ban on broadcasting journalistic socio-political and news programs created by Russian TV channels in Belarus ; \u2022 inclusion in the standard TV package of mandatory public TV channels of Latvia , Lithuania , Poland , Ukraine ; \u2022 resumption of permanent activities of the Public Coordinating Council in the field of mass media .\n\u2022 withdrawal from the CSTO , return of full control of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ defense systems ; \u2022 withdrawal from the territory of Belarus of Russian military facilities \u2013 a communication center in Vileyka and a radar station near Baranovichi ; \u2022 expansion of patriotic education in the Belarusian army ; \u2022 translation of educational work in the army into Belarusian ; \u2022 development of border infrastructure at the borders with EU countries , increasing the capacity of border crossings .\n\u2022 ban on commissioning and closure of new harmful industries in Brest , Mogilev , Svetlogorsk ; \u2022 publication of comprehensive truthful information on the construction @ @ @ @ @ @ @ NPP ; \u2022 holding a broad public discussion on the fate of the Astravets NPP .\n\u2022 raising wages and improving the working conditions of health and education workers .\n\u2022 \u2022 popularization of national heroes with a bias in the XIX and XX centuries ; \u2022 popularization of Kastus Kalinouski as a political founder of the modern Belarusian nation , as a symbol of the struggle of Belarusians for freedom and independence and as a figure that should consolidate around all those committed to the values \u200b\u200bof national revival and independence .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ by 2025 and 2030 respectively , when the plan is for Belarus to finally enter NATO and the EU .\nThe plan by 2030 also includes strengthening cooperation and formation of strategic partnership within the Baltic-Black Sea community , formation and organizational design of the relevant regional intergovernmental bloc .\nAdditionally , diversifying energy supplies by 2030 is also important : a limit on the share of suppliers in any of the countries to a maximum of 30 % of total energy imports .\nThis is specifically aimed against Russia , but is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that is why it is not mentioned in the immediate steps to be taken .\nNaturally , Tsikhanovskaya would also need outside help , and she issued an appeal to the European Council for assistance .\nSumming up the plans and actions of the Belarusian \u2018 opposition \u2019 , it becomes evident that its main goal is to seize power with the support of Western backers by any means and then just turn Belarus into Ukraine 2.0 .\nThe Belarus sovereignty , economy and interests of Belarusian citizens will be sacrificed for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Western-funded \u2018 activists \u2019 and \u2018 politicians \u2019 and the country will be sold off to Euro-Atlantic structures .", "author": "NEWS WIRE", "url": "https://21stcenturywire.com/2020/08/20/belarus-opposition-document-reveals-agenda-to-pull-country-into-nato-and-eu/",

country of Australia has now become ground zero for expediting the New Normal agenda .\nAs the world spotlight now hones in on the draconian measures being enforced by the Australian government , ministerial departments are relying on numerous spokespersons in order to sell what are effectively unconstitutional policies and dictatorial \u2018 health regulations.\n\u2019 Currently running cover for the Prime Minister is Australia \u2019 s Health Minister Greg @ @ @ @ @ @ @ aggressive stance against civil liberties this week , which he believes is justified because the supposed \u2018 threat of the pandemic.\n\u2019 Hunt is championing an initiative previously launched by the country \u2019 s current Prime Minister Scot Morrison which was cynically named , \u201c No Jab , No Pay.\n\u201d Hunt explains how the government make its citizens take any vaccine they want to administer : \u201c We are keeping on the table the existing mechanisms we have such as no jab , no pay [ and ] no jab , no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We are one of the world \u2019 s great vaccination nations and I expect very widespread uptake.\n\u201d Another prominent public face is Deputy Chief Medical Officer Dr Nick Coatsworth , who has been tacked with promoting a number of Chinese-style medical surveillance initiatives including the country \u2019 s dubious \u201c COVIDSafe \u201d app , which the government claims has helped stop the spread of coronavirus .\nThis week , Coatsworth was sent in front of the cameras to sell what has become the world \u2019 s most totalitarian government vaccine policy \u2013 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ benefits to vulnerable citizens , and even deny children access to education \u2013 unless they accept government \u201c encouragement \u201d to take whatever vaccines are being mandated at the time .\nDr. Coatsworth explains in the video clip below : These remarks come just days after Prime Minister Scott Morrison let slip in public \u2013 revealing his own preference for mandatory vaccinations of Australians , before quickly walking back his statement .\n\u201c There are no mechanisms for compulsory \u2026 I mean , we can \u2019 t hold someone down and make them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yesterday .\nIt \u2019 s now clear that the Australian government will attempt to use its divisive \u201c No Jab , No Pay \u201d scheme in order to force its most vulnerable and dependent members of the population to accept the newly fast-tracked , experimental COVID vaccine being touted by transnational pharmaceutical corporations like AstraZeneca and their financiers at the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation .\nGovernment and mainstream media are also drafting in other surrogates to help sell the new vaccine agenda , like Dr Zac Turner who recently went on record @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the government should use its power to single out any \u201c anti-vaxxers \u201d and suspend their normal rights as citizens until they accept the government \u2019 s list of vaccines \u2013 in the name of \u2018 public health.\n\u2019 One thing is clear : this government seems determined to implement this transnational corporate agenda \u2013 regardless of the effects on its people .\nAustralians who reject coronavirus vaccination could lose access to some welfare payments , Health Minister Greg Hunt has said , after the Prime Minister conceded vaccination would not be mandatory @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vaccine is not yet certain , the Government has taken steps to secure supply of a leading candidate developed at Oxford University .\nHealth Minister Greg Hunt said if a vaccine was discovered , the Government would consider applying measures like \u201c no jab , no pay \u201d to ensure a high uptake .\n\u201c It won \u2019 t be mandatory , but it will be widely encouraged , \u201d he said .\nThe

pay policy , which was introduced in 2015 , had helped lift child immunisation rates for other diseases .\nUnder the policy , to be eligible for the full Family Tax Benefit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , children need to be immunised .\nAsked whether vaccination status could be linked to welfare payments , school attendance or travel , Mr Hunt said the Government reserved the right to make such moves .\n\u201c I \u2019 m confident that a very , very large numbers of Australians will take it up , \u201d he said .\n\u201c We reserve the right , subject to medical advice , to take steps that might

Friday , 21 August 2020 , Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan ( aka the Prez ) took to the stage to make a well-publicised announcement : \u201c Turkey has made its biggest natural gas discovery , \u201d and he went on to speak about a \u201d new era \u201d for the country and its standing in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unshaken faith in his creator , the Prez also stated that \u201c [ n ] ew discoveries of natural gas are highly possible , \u201d expressing his hope that Turkish exploration teams will discover more hidden oil and gas wealth in due time .\nSpeaking at the Kalyon G\u00fcne\u015f Teknolojileri factory on Wednesday , 19 August , Turkey \u2019 s President announced that he would have \u2018 good tidings \u2019 ( or m\u00fcjde , in Turkish ) to announce on the following Friday .\nWhile opening a factory that has received a $ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ panels , a clearly proud and happy Erdo\u011fan made the announcement , leading many to speculate that his announced-and-as-yet-undeclared \u2018 good tidings \u2019 would be about some kind of energy-related enterprise and and/or discovery .\nAnd , writing for Bloomberg on the same day and at about the same time , \u00c7a\u011fan Koc , Selcan Hacao\u011flu , and Asl\u0131 Kandemir all but confirmed this expectation while taking the wind our of the Prez \u2019 s sails : \u201c Turkey has discovered energy in the Black Sea , most likely natural gas , two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said Wednesday [ , 19 August 2020 ] , but gave no indication of the size and depth of the find , nor how difficult it will be to extract.\n\u201d In fact , Bloomberg even tweeted about their scoop , in this way totally deflating Tayyip Erdo\u011fan \u2019 s best-laid plans to surprise Turkey and the world with his m\u00fcjde .\nIn fact , last year , Turkey \u2019 s strongman had already made such stunning statements \u2013 statements that subsequently proved all but illusory if not misleading .\nSpeaking in Edirne @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : \u201c [ w ] e have discovered new gas fields [ holding ] 3 billion cubic metres of natural gas reserves , which will double the gas production present in [ the province of ] Thrace .\nThis figure is in the order of a capacity that will meet 10 years \u2019 worth of gas demand of 300,000 households.\n\u201d At the time , Erdo\u011fan was speaking in the run up to the national local elections ( 31 March 2019 ) .\nIn spite of these encouraging words , Edirne \u2019 s @ @ @ @ @ @ @ opposition CHP ( or Republican People \u2019 s Party ) \u2019 s Recep G\u00fcrkan with a % 44.9 share of the vote .\nAs a result , some voices have now aired the opinion that the recent \u2018 good tidings \u2019 should also be understood as an electioneering stunt , as general elections are scheduled to be held in Turkey on or before 25 June 2023 The veteran Turkish journalist Murat Yetkin , who famously left the one-time flagship daily H\u00fcrriyet following the hostile take-over of the Do\u011fan Haber Ajans\u0131 ( DHA ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( DHA ) , all but confirms such an impression .\nWriting on his personal blog , Yetkin does not mince his words : \u201c Erdo\u011fan wants some kind of election guarantee from the citizens as he says the gas extraction will start in 2023 .\nIt looks as if the President wants to give an impression that any other government else than his would not like to benefit from this valuable discovery that the country made after such long years of research.\n\u201d As a Middle-Eastern country lacking serious hydrocarbon reserves of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reliant upon gas and oil imports \u2013 from Russia and Iran primarily .\nAt the same time , the AKP-led governments have over the years been prospecting for oil and gas throughout the whole of the country .\nIn fact , Tayyip Erdo\u011fan and his henchmen have been enthusiastically investigating the land and its past in order to discover hitherto unknown sources of energy within Turkey \u2019 s borders .\nYetkin insightfully remarks that before \u201c the 2007 elections , it was announced that natural gas was found in Thrace and Salt Lake @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the 2010 constitutional referendum , Turkey found oil in Manisa and Ergani.\n\u201d More than ten year ago , the then-Minister for Energy and Natural Resources Taner Y\u0131ld\u0131z spoke at the 9th International Oil and Gas Conference at Ankara \u2019 s Sheraton Hotel ( 16-17 March 2010 ) , to declare that \u201c there are big and significant natural gas and oil reserves in the east of Turkey .\nTurkey shapes its energy policies and diplomacy by taking them into consideration.\n\u201d Y\u0131ld\u0131z \u2019 s statement was clearly devoid of any truth , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ went as far as fearlessly combining economic needs and necessities with the nation \u2019 s leaders \u2019 pseudo-Ottoman proclivities , saying that Turkey has \u201c as many [ oil ] wells as Saudi Arabia , but [ the Saudis ] are only able to extract 10 million barrels [ of oil ] .\n[ Turkey , on the other hand ] is able to extract 50 million barrels.\n\u201d Though his statement made on national television also clearly lacked any base in reality , Y\u0131ld\u0131z \u2019 s bold claims relied on information contained @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , \u2019 commissioned by Sultan Abd\u00fclhamid II ( 1876-1909 ) .\nIn 2012 , Taner Y\u0131ld\u0131z had presented Abd\u00fclhamid \u2019 s \u2018 Oil Map \u2019 to the Turkish press , as historical evidence of Turkey \u2019 s untapped energy resources .\nThis map was in fact prepared by a German team in the year 1901 , in the context of the construction of the Berlin-Baghdad-Basra rail link .\nAccording to the AKP Minister Y\u0131ld\u0131z , \u201c [ t ] his map also includes such places like Batman and Ad\u0131yaman where we are now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And in February 2013 , speaking on the state broadcaster TRT \u2019 s programme Neler Oluyor , Y\u0131ld\u0131z said that \u201c [ t ] his map can become real .\nThis map is congruent with today \u2019 s scientific research .\nThat is the interesting [ part ] .\n\u201d In reality though Sultan Abd\u00fclhamid \u2019 s \u2018 Oil Map \u2019 proved to be yet another pipe dream .\nAs related by Yetkin , before \u201c the 2014 elections , the good news [ was ] the finding of shale gas in Diyarbak\u0131r @ @ @ @ @ @ @ s demand for 40 years .\nAhead of the June 7 , 2015 election , it was announced that natural gas was found in Thrace , and before the Nov. 1 , 2015 election , natural gas was discovered in the Black Sea .\nBefore the 2018 elections , new oil fields were found in Mardin , \u015e\u0131rnak , Hakkari , Batman and Siirt and natural gas in Thrace.\n\u201d But now , the Prez himself is adamant that the drillship Fatih has discovered rich gas holdings ( \u201c some 320 billion cubic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , within Turkey \u2019 s territorial waters .\nBut the online news website Ahval puts forward that many \u2018 analysts and officials have said Erdo\u011fan \u2019 s recent foreign and domestic ventures \u2013 including converting the Hagia Sopha landmark into a mosque and risking a direct confrontation with neighbouring Greece over territorial disputes \u2013 are designed to divert the Turkish public \u2019 s attention away from Turkey \u2019 s cratering economy.\n\u2019 For , one should not lose track of the fact that though the drillship Fatih discovered gas under the Black Sea @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Mediterranean , while claiming a special territorial relationship with Libya across the water on the African continent .\nAs the Greek journalist John Psaropoulos , whom I am happy to call my friend , points out : \u201c Twice in three weeks this summer , Greece and Turkey poised to clash in the Eastern Mediterranean .\n.\n.\nGreek and Turkish navies fanned out across the Aegean and east Mediterranean .\nThe two NATO allies have come closer to open conflict than they have since 1996 , when Turkey planted a flag @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Aegean , and since 1987 , when Turkey again sent a survey ship into the north Aegean.\n\u201d But in spite of this recent and loud sabre-rattling , Psaropoulos correctly point out that \u201c Turkey seeks to corner Greece into a maritime territorial settlement.\n\u201d For , the Prez is really looking for a deal , a deal would skirt \u201c past established international legal norms , [ a deal that would ] force Greece , and later Cyprus , to declare their vast continental shelves joint development zones with Turkey.\n\u201d The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Prez to replicate his Black Sea \u2018 good tidings.\n\u2019 As Fatih \u2019 s find does not really appear to be that significant at the end of the day , as underlined by the Turkish economist U\u011fur G\u00fcrses : Turkey \u2019 s domestic \u201c consumption of roughly 45 billion square cubes [ of natural gas ] a year roughly translates to seven years of production.\n\u201d And that means , that the drillship Fatih might just be able to carry the Prez and his AKP henchmen into the uncharted territories beyond the centenary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ second century of Turkey \u2019 s existence promises to be an era quite unlike any in the Republic \u2019 s history , an era that would undoubtedly flourish with Mediterranean gas to fund and uphold Tayyip Erdo\u011fan \u2019 s pseudo-Ottoman dreams of the New Turkey as an Islamic state in its own right .\nOther than Erdo\u011fan \u2019 s m\u00fcjde on 21 August , another event also occupied the headlines and shocked people all around the world : The Kariye Museum , which had previously been known as the Church of the Holy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to a mosque .\nFollowing last month \u2019 s re-conversion of the Ayasofya , this 11th-century Orthodox church that had been a mosque following the conquest of Istanbul but was used as a museum since 1945 \u2013 the building namely houses most exquisite examples of Byzantine frescoes and mosaics \u2013 was also turned into a mosque again .\nStill , this event should not have come as a surprise : a \u201c Turkish court [ already ] in November [ 2019 ] annulled Chora \u2019 s museum status and [ now ] on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Erdogan declared \u2018 the management of the Kariye Mosque be transferred to the Religious Affairs Directorate [ or Diyanet ] , and opened to worship.\n\u2019 The pro-government Daily Sabah newspaper reported that Turkey \u2019 s religious authorities plan to cover the renowned Byzantine-era frescoes and mosaics during prayers.\n\u201d In this way , in the space of but a month , the Prez turned two important samples of Istanbul \u2019 s pre-Ottoman cultural heritage into Muslim places of worship .\nAt the same time , another well-known relic of the city @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attack now : namely , the Galata tower , built by the Genoese in 1348 as part of the city wall surrounding its trade colony in the Eastern Roman capital of Constantinople .\nFollowing the conquest of the city , Sultan Mehmed II ( 1451-81 ) , popularly known as \u201c Fatih \u201d or \u201c The Conqueror in Turkey , \u201d ordered the demolition of the wall , but allowed the tower to remain .\nIn the following centuries , the Galata Tower became part and parcel of the Ottoman city and entered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the tower which had been part of the remit of the Istanbul Municipality for the past 164 years , became subject to the AKP Ministry of Culture and Tourism by means of a sudden legal decree .\nAnd subsequently , the Ministry set to work straightaway , initiating its renovation , \u201c one jackhammer blow at a time.\n\u201d Whether this is but the outcome of the common misapprehension present in Turkey when it comes to renovation and restoration , or the result of Ankara \u2019 s attempt to rid the erstwhile Ottoman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ open question .\nAt the same time , employing the ongoing coronavirus hysteria as an excuse , the Ankara government has cancelled this year \u2019 s Victory Day celebrations ( Zafer Bayram\u0131 ) , commemorating Mustafa Kemal \u2019 s victory over the Greek military at Dumlup\u0131nar in 1922 .\nThis victory ended the War of Independence ( 1919-22 ) and directly led to the signature of the Treary of Lausanne ( 24 July 1923 ) and the subsequent foundation of the Republic of Turkey ( 29 October 1923 ) .\nAre these portents @ @ @ @ @ @ @ henchmen are really getting ready to bring back Islamic rule to Turkey on the 100th anniversary of the Turkish state \u2019 s foundation .\n.\n.\nWill the culmination of the AKP policy of Sunnification be the foundation of a pseudo-Ottoman Federation of Islamic Peoples of Anatolia , arguably still called Turkey yet ruled by Sharia law ?\nWill this also lead to a revived Caliphate and a united Islamic world following Turkey \u2019 s lead ?\nWe will arguably find out in

enemy at the gates is less formidable , for he is known and carries his banner openly .\nBut the traitor moves amongst those within the gate freely , his sly whispers rustling through all the alleys , heard in the very halls of government itself.\n\u201d \u2013 Marcus Tullius Cicero The Transition Integrity Project ( TIP ) is a shadowy group of government , military and media elites who have concocted a plan to spread mayhem @ @ @ @ @ @ @ elections .\nThe strategy takes advantage of the presumed delay in determining the winner of the upcoming election ( due to the deluge of mail-in votes ) .\nThe interim period is expected to intensify partisan warfare creating the perfect environment for disseminating propaganda and inciting street violence .\nThe leaders of TIP believe that a mass mobilization will help them to achieve what Russiagate could not , that is , the removal Donald Trump via an illicit coup conjured up by behind-the-scenes powerbrokers and their Democrat allies .\nHere \u2019 s a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Chris Farrell at the Gatestone Institute : Farrell is right .\nAs we can see from the many articles that have recently popped up in the media , the American people are being prepared for a contested election that will fuel public anxiety and revolt .\nThis all fits with the overall strategy of the TIP .\nSelected journalists will be used to provide bits of information that serve the interests of the group while the people will be told to expect a long and drawn-out constitutional crisis .\nMeanwhile , the media @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and elements in the Intelligence Community will put pressure on Trump to step down while firing up their political base to take to the streets .\nTIP \u2019 s 22-page manifesto makes it clear that mass mobilization will be key to any electoral victory .\nHere \u2019 s an excerpt from the text : In other words , the authors fully support demonstrations and political upheaval to achieve their goal of removing Trump .\nClearly , this scorched earth approach did not originate with Joe Biden , but with the cynical and bloodthirsty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who will do anything to advance their agenda .\nThis is a full-blown color revolution authored and supported by the same oligarchs and deep-state honchoes that have opposed Trump from the very beginning .\nThey \u2019 re not going to back down or call off the dogs until the job is done and Trump is gone .\nAnd when the dust settles , Trump will likely be charged , tried , sentenced and imprisoned .\nHis fortune will be seized , his family will be financially ruined , and his closest advisors and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nThere \u2019 s not going to be a \u201c graceful transition \u201d of power if Trump loses .\nHe will face the full wrath of the scheming mandarins he has frustrated for the last 4 years .\nThese are the men who applauded when Saddam and Ghaddafi were savagely butchered .\nWill Trump face the same fate as them ?\nTrump has less than two months to rally his supporters , draw attention to the conspiracy that has is presently underway , and figure out a way to defend himself against the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to derail the impending junta , his goose is cooked .\nIt \u2019 s worth noting , that the Transition Integrity Project ( TIP ) has no legal authority to meddle in the upcoming election .\nThey were not appointed by any congressional committee nor did any government entity approve their intrusive activities .\nThis is entirely a \u201c lone wolf \u201d operation designed to exploit loopholes in campaign laws in order to undermine public confidence in our elections and to express their unbridled hostility towards Donald Trump .\nThat said , there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their views .\nIn the first page of their \u201c Executive Summary \u201d they say : This short statement provides the basic justification for the group \u2019 s existence .\nIt presents the participants as impartial observers performing their civic duty by objectively analyzing exercises ( war games ? )\nthat indicate that Trump will challenge the election results in a desperate attempt to hold on to power .\nNot surprisingly , the group provides no evidence that the president would react the way they think he would .\nIn fact , their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that Trump has no militia , no private army , and very few allies among the political class , the Intelligence Community , the FBI , the military or the deep state .\nWho exactly does the group think would help Trump hold on to power : Bill Barr , Larry Kudlow , Melania ?\n?\nThere is nothing \u201c impartial \u201d about this analysis .\nIt is partisan gibberish aimed at discrediting Trump while creating a pretext for launching a coup against him .\nHere is another sample of TIP \u2019 s @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the manuscript : Got that ?\nIn other words ( to paraphrase ) \u201c Trump is a corrupt dictator who hates democracy and the rule of law , but that is just our unbiased opinion .\nPlease , don \u2019 t let that influence your vote .\nWe just want to make sure the election goes smoothly.\n\u201d As we noted , the hatred for Trump permeates the entire 22-page document and that

that are recommended .\nThis is a partisan project concocted by malicious elites who despise Trump and who plan to remove him from office by hook or crook .\nSo , do we know who the leaders of this ( TIP ) group are ?\nWell , we know who their two main spokesmen are : Rosa Brooks\u2013 Georgetown law professor and co-founder of the Transition Integrity Project , and Ret .\nCol. Lawrence Wilkerson , Distinguished Adjunct Professor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ College of William & Mary , and chief of staff to former Secretary of State Colin Powell .\nAccording to an article by Whitney Webb : \u201c ( Rosa ) Brooks\u2026 was an advisor to the Pentagon and the Hillary Clinton-led State Department during the Obama administration .\nShe was also previously the general counsel to the President of the Open Society Institute , part of the Open Society Foundations ( OSF ) , a controversial organization funded by billionaire George Soros .\nZoe Hudson , who is TIP \u2019 s director , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ OSF , serving as senior policy analyst and liaison between the foundations and the U.S. government for 11 years .\nOSF ties to the TIP are a red flag for a number of reasons , namely due to the fact that OSF and other Soros-funded organizations played a critical role in fomenting so-called \u201c color revolutions \u201d to overthrow non-aligned governments , particularly during the Obama administration .\nExamples of OSF \u2019 s ties to these manufactured \u201c revolutions \u201d include Ukraine in 2014 and the \u201c Arab Spring \u201d \u2026..\nIn addition @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and OSF , Brooks is currently a scholar at West Point \u2019 s Modern War Institute , where she focuses on \u201c the relationship between the military and domestic policing \u201d and also Georgetown \u2019 s Innovative Policing Program .\nShe is a currently a key player in the documented OSF-led push to \u201c capitalize \u201d off of legitimate calls for police reform to justify the creation of a federalized police force under the guise of defunding and/or eliminating local police departments.Brooks \u2019 interest in the \u201c blurring line \u201d between military and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a military coup to remove Trump from office and the TIP \u2019 s subsequent conclusion that the military \u201c may \u201d have to step in if Trump manages to win the 2020 election , per the group

to research \u201c ranking digital rights.\n\u201d Notably , of these funders , Reid Hoffman was caught \u201c meddling \u201d in the most recent Democratic primary to undercut Bernie Sanders \u2019 candidacy during the Iowa caucus and while others , such as Eric Schmidt and Pierre Omidyar , are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Clinton family and even ties to Hillary Clinton \u2019 s 2016 campaign.\n\u201d ( \u201c \u201c Bipartisan \u201d Washington Insiders Reveal Their Plan for Chaos if Trump Wins the Election \u201c , Unlimited Hangout ) Is it safe to say that Rosa Brooks is a stooge ( supported by Elite foundations ) overseeing a color revolution in the United States aimed at toppling Trump and replacing him with a dementia-addled , meat-puppet named Joe Biden ?\nPolitical analyst Paul Craig Roberts seems to think so .\nHere \u2019 s what he said in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u201c I have provided evidence that the military/security complex , using the media and the Democrats , intends to turn the November election into a color revolution\u2026 The evidence of a color revolution in the works is abundantly supplied by CNN , MSNBC , New York Times , NPR , Washington Post and numerous Internet sites funded by the CIA and the foundations and corporations through which it operates.. \u2026 All of these media organizations are establishing the story in the mind of Americans that Trump will not leave office when he loses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ driven out .\n\u2026With Antifa and Black Lives Matter now experienced in violent protests , they will be unleashed anew on American cities when there is news of a Trump election victory .\nThe media will explain the violence as necessary to free us from a tyrant and egg on the violence , as will the Democrat Party .\nThe CIA will be certain that the violence is well funded\u2026 .\n\u2026 What is a reelected President Trump going to do when the Secret Service refuses to repel Antifa and Black Lives Matter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u2026 American Democracy is on the verge of being ended for all times , and the world media will herald the event as the successful overthrowing of a tyrant.\n\u201d ( \u201c America \u2019 s Color Revolution \u201d , Paul Craig Roberts ) Another of the leading spokesmen for TIP is Retired Colonel Lawrence Wilkerson who made this revealing statement in a recent interview : Why is Wilkerson so encouraged by the young people he \u2019 s trained to act as poll workers ?\nDoesn \u2019 t that sound a bit fishy , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ s mixed up with a group whose sole aim is to beat Trump ?\nAnd why are the authors of the TIP manifesto so eager to reveal their true intentions .\nTake a look : So , that \u2019 s the GamePlan , eh ?\nThe coup plotters want a contested election that drags on for weeks , deepens divisions among the population , undermines confidence in the electoral system , instigates ferocious street fighting in cities across the country , and gives the Biden camp time to mobilize its political resources in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Trump .\nCan we at least call this treachery by its proper name : Treason\u2013 \u201c the crime of betraying one \u2019 s country by trying to overthrow the government ?\n\u201d *** Mike Whitney is a

whispers rustling through all the alleys , heard in the very halls of government itself.\n\u201d \u2013 Marcus Tullius Cicero The Transition Integrity Project ( TIP ) is a shadowy group of government , military and media elites who have concocted a plan to spread mayhem @ @ @ @ @ @ @ elections .\nThe strategy takes advantage of the presumed delay in determining the winner of the upcoming election ( due to the deluge of mail-in votes ) .\nThe interim period is expected to intensify partisan warfare creating the perfect environment for disseminating propaganda and inciting street violence .\nThe leaders of TIP believe that a mass mobilization will help them to achieve what Russiagate could not , that is , the removal Donald Trump via an illicit coup conjured up by behind-the-scenes powerbrokers and their Democrat allies .\nHere \u2019 s a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Chris Farrell at the Gatestone Institute : Farrell is right .\nAs we can see from the many articles that have recently popped up in the media , the American people are being prepared for a contested election that will fuel public anxiety and revolt .\nThis all fits with the overall strategy of the TIP .\nSelected journalists will be used to provide bits of information that serve the interests of the group while the people will be told to expect a long and drawn-out constitutional crisis .\nMeanwhile , the media @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and elements in the Intelligence Community will put pressure on Trump to step down while firing up their political base to take to the streets .\nTIP \u2019 s 22-page manifesto makes it clear that mass mobilization will be key to any electoral victory .\nHere \u2019 s an excerpt from the text : In other words , the authors fully support demonstrations and political upheaval to achieve their goal of removing Trump .\nClearly , this scorched earth approach did not originate with Joe Biden , but with the cynical and bloodthirsty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who will do anything to advance their agenda .\nThis is a full-blown color revolution authored and supported by the same oligarchs and deep-state honchoes that have opposed Trump from the very beginning .\nThey \u2019 re not going to back down or call off the dogs until the job is done and Trump is gone .\nAnd when the dust settles , Trump will likely be charged , tried , sentenced and imprisoned .\nHis fortune will be seized , his family will be financially ruined , and his closest advisors and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nThere \u2019 s not going to be a \u201c graceful transition \u201d of power if Trump loses .\nHe will face the full wrath of the scheming mandarins he has frustrated for the last 4 years .\nThese are the men who applauded when Saddam and Ghaddafi were savagely butchered .\nWill Trump face the same fate as them ?\nTrump has less than two months to rally his supporters , draw attention to the conspiracy that has is presently underway , and figure out a way to defend himself against the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to derail the impending junta , his goose is cooked .\nIt \u2019 s worth noting , that the Transition Integrity Project ( TIP ) has no legal authority to meddle in the upcoming election .\nThey were not appointed by any congressional committee nor did any government entity approve their intrusive activities .\nThis is entirely a \u201c lone wolf \u201d operation designed to exploit loopholes in campaign laws in order to undermine public confidence in our elections and to express their unbridled hostility towards Donald Trump .\nThat said , there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their views .\nIn the first page of their \u201c Executive Summary \u201d they say : This short statement provides the basic justification for the group \u2019 s existence .\nIt presents the participants as impartial observers performing their civic duty by objectively analyzing exercises ( war games ? )\nthat indicate that Trump will challenge the election results in a desperate attempt to hold on to power .\nNot surprisingly , the group provides no evidence that the president would react the way they think he would .\nIn fact , their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that Trump has no militia , no private army , and very few allies among the political class , the Intelligence Community , the FBI , the military or the deep state .\nWho exactly does the group think would help Trump hold on to power : Bill Barr , Larry Kudlow , Melania ?\n?\nThere is nothing \u201c impartial \u201d about this analysis .\nIt is partisan gibberish aimed at discrediting Trump while creating a pretext for launching a coup against him .\nHere is another sample of TIP \u2019 s @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the manuscript : Got that ?\nIn other words ( to paraphrase ) \u201c Trump is a corrupt dictator who hates democracy and the rule of law , but that is just our unbiased opinion .\nPlease , don \u2019 t let that influence your vote .\nWe just want to make sure the election goes smoothly.\n\u201d As we noted , the hatred for Trump permeates the entire 22-page document and that , in turn , undermines the credibility of the author to portray his project as an impartial examination of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There is nothing evenhanded in the approach to these issues or in the remedies that are recommended .\nThis is a partisan project concocted by malicious elites who despise Trump and who plan to remove him from office by hook or crook .\nSo , do we know who the leaders of this ( TIP ) group are ?\nWell , we know who their two main spokesmen are : Rosa Brooks\u2013 Georgetown law professor and co-founder of the Transition Integrity Project , and Ret .\nCol. Lawrence Wilkerson , Distinguished Adjunct Professor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ College of William & Mary , and chief of staff to former Secretary of State Colin Powell .\nAccording to an article by Whitney Webb : \u201c ( Rosa ) Brooks\u2026 was an advisor to the Pentagon and the Hillary Clinton-led State Department during the Obama administration .\nShe was also previously the general counsel to the President of the Open Society Institute , part of the Open Society Foundations ( OSF ) , a controversial organization funded by billionaire George Soros .\nZoe Hudson , who is TIP \u2019 s director , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ OSF , serving as senior policy analyst and liaison between the foundations and the U.S. government for 11 years .\nOSF ties to the TIP are a red flag for a number of reasons , namely due to the fact that OSF and other Soros-funded organizations played a critical role in fomenting so-called \u201c color revolutions \u201d to overthrow non-aligned governments , particularly during the Obama administration .\nExamples of OSF \u2019 s ties to these manufactured \u201c revolutions \u201d include Ukraine in 2014 and the \u201c Arab Spring \u201d \u2026..\nIn addition @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and OSF , Brooks is currently a scholar at West Point \u2019 s Modern War Institute , where she focuses on \u201c the relationship between the military and domestic policing \u201d and also Georgetown \u2019 s Innovative Policing Program .\nShe is a currently a key player in the documented OSF-led push to \u201c capitalize \u201d off of legitimate calls for police reform to justify the creation of a federalized police force under the guise of defunding and/or eliminating local police departments.Brooks \u2019 interest in the \u201c blurring line \u201d between military and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a military coup to remove Trump from office and the TIP \u2019 s subsequent conclusion that the military \u201c may \u201d have to step in if Trump manages to win the 2020 election , per the group \u2019 s \u201c war games \u201d described above .\nBrooks is also a senior fellow at the think tank New America .\nNew America \u2019 s mission statement notes that the organization is focused on \u201c honestly confronting the challenges caused by rapid technological and social change , and seizing the opportunities those changes create.\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ Valley billionaires , including Bill Gates ( Microsoft ) , Eric Schmidt ( Google ) , Reid Hoffman ( LinkedIn ) , Jeffrey Skoll and Pierre Omidyar ( eBay ) .\nIn addition , it has received millions directly from the U.S. State Department to research \u201c ranking digital rights.\n\u201d Notably , of these funders , Reid Hoffman was caught \u201c meddling \u201d in the most recent Democratic primary to undercut Bernie Sanders \u2019 candidacy during the Iowa caucus and while others , such as Eric Schmidt and Pierre Omidyar , are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Clinton family and even ties to Hillary Clinton \u2019 s 2016 campaign.\n\u201d ( \u201c \u201c Bipartisan \u201d Washington Insiders Reveal Their Plan for Chaos if Trump Wins the Election \u201c , Unlimited Hangout ) Is it safe to say that Rosa Brooks is a stooge ( supported by Elite foundations ) overseeing a color revolution in the United States aimed at toppling Trump and replacing him with a dementia-addled , meat-puppet named Joe Biden ?\nPolitical analyst Paul Craig Roberts seems to think so .\nHere \u2019 s what he said in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u201c I have provided evidence that the military/security complex , using the media and the Democrats , intends to turn the November election into a color revolution\u2026 The evidence of a color revolution in the works is abundantly supplied by CNN , MSNBC , New York Times , NPR , Washington Post and numerous Internet sites funded by the CIA and the foundations and corporations through which it operates.. \u2026 All of these media organizations are establishing the story in the mind of Americans that Trump will not leave office when he loses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ driven out .\n\u2026With Antifa and Black Lives Matter now experienced in violent protests , they will be unleashed anew on American cities when there is news of a Trump election victory .\nThe media will explain the violence as necessary to free us from a tyrant and egg on the violence , as will the Democrat Party .\nThe CIA will be certain that the violence is well funded\u2026 .\n\u2026 What is a reelected President Trump going to do when the Secret Service refuses to repel Antifa and Black Lives Matter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u2026 American Democracy is on the verge of being ended for all times , and the world media will herald the event as the successful overthrowing of a tyrant.\n\u201d ( \u201c America \u2019 s Color Revolution \u201d , Paul Craig Roberts ) Another of the leading spokesmen for TIP is Retired Colonel Lawrence Wilkerson who made this revealing statement in a recent interview : Why is Wilkerson so encouraged by the young people he \u2019 s trained to act as poll workers ?\nDoesn \u2019 t that sound a bit fishy , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ s mixed up with a group whose sole aim is to beat Trump ?\nAnd why are the authors of the TIP manifesto so eager to reveal their true intentions .\nTake a look : So , that \u2019 s the GamePlan , eh ?\nThe coup plotters want a contested election that drags on for weeks , deepens divisions among the population , undermines confidence in the electoral system , instigates ferocious street fighting in cities across the country , and gives the Biden camp time to mobilize its political resources in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Trump .\nCan we at least call this treachery by its proper name : Treason\u2013 \u201c the crime of betraying one \u2019 s country by trying to overthrow the government ?\n\u201d *** Mike Whitney is a

Central Asia , while also being the poorest and by far the most politically unstable , having suffered three revolutions in 15 years .\nUkraine , meanwhile , has long had far more competitive elections than its neighbors Russia and Belarus , and yet has suffered two revolutions and a civil war .\nThere is no obvious correlation between democracy and stability .\nAnother lens through which to look at the problem is postcolonialism .\nThe FSU could be seen as suffering @ @ @ @ @ @ @ French colonies once they gained independence .\nAll too often , the democratic systems left by the colonizers rapidly collapsed in a succession of military coups , revolutions , and insurgencies .\nVarious factors explain this : for instance , artificial borders that did not coincide with ethnic boundaries ; weak state institutions ; and endemic poverty .\nOne can see a similar dynamic in the post-Soviet space .\nThe republics that gained independence in 1991/92 in many cases lacked clearly defined and well-established national identities , or contained large ethnic minorities .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ statehood and strong institutions \u2013 the primary institution that had previously held them together was the Communist Party , which no longer existed .\nAll this mattered , and continues to matter , as government legitimacy derives from more than competitive elections .\nIt rests also on a sense that a country \u2019 s rulers represent the people , their culture , and their values , as well as on a recognition that they are able to deliver competent government .\nIn the absence of a unifying national identity and a strong central @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and society fractures .\nThe problem that former Soviet states face is that it takes a very long time to overcome these limitations , and attempts to do so can often backfire , particularly when efforts are made to force a certain national identity on an unwilling population ( or at least on a population part of which is unwilling ) .\nIn such cases , discontented groups take matters into their own hands through secession , revolution , or other political action .\nAs if this were not bad enough , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to cope with the resulting conflicts .\nThis is particularly true when it comes to separatism and the redrawing of borders .\nUntil at least 1945 , wars often ended in the transfer of territory , enshrined in a treaty between the winner and the loser .\nIn the modern era , however , the territorial integrity of states has become a sacrosanct element of the international order .\nDefeated nations simply refuse to recognize the loss of territory , while other states back them in this refusal .\nThe result is one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ era , the so-called frozen conflict , which involves breakaway territories achieving de facto independence , but being unable to gain recognition of this .\nConsequently , they exist in a long-term limbo in which they can often survive only by means of illicit economic activities .\nNeither they nor the international community as a whole benefit from the failure to recognize the realities on the ground .\nBut time after time , adherence to the principle of territorial integrity trumps the making of peace .\nOf course , no single one of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ problems faced by post-Soviet states .\nIt is rather the different combinations of various of them in different cases that provides for the variety of conflicts we see today .\nUnfortunately , this means that easy answers are not to be found .\nAuthor Paul Robinson is a professor at the University of Ottawa .\nHe

( TIP ) are on record as war-gaming a plan to spread mayhem and misinformation following the November 3 presidential elections by capitalizing on a party-wide strategy which seeks to delay postal vote submissions up to 10-14 days after the national election on Nov 3rd .\nIt relies on taking advantage of any presumed delays in determining the winner ( due to the deluge of postal votes ) in a group of key swing states , including hotly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ] he American people are being prepared for a contested election that will fuel public anxiety and revolt .\nThis all fits with the overall strategy of the TIP .\nSelected journalists will be used to provide bits of information that serve the interests of the group while the people will be told to expect a long and drawn-out constitutional crisis

The Transition Integrity Project ) This week a Michigan court ruled to block the Democrat plan which appears to be designed to sow chaos in the wake of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ presiding judge noting that , \u201c The constitution is not suspended or transformed even in times of a pandemic\u2026 \u201d Needless to say , the Democratic Party was visibly disheveled by the court \u2019 s decision .\nDETROIT ( AP ) \u2014 Absentee ballots must arrive by Election Day to be counted , the Michigan Court of Appeals said Friday , blocking a 14-day extension that had been ordered by a lower court and embraced by key Democratic officials in a battleground state .\nAny changes must rest with the Legislature , not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ judges said in a 3-0 opinion .\nAbsentee ballot extensions in Wisconsin and Indiana have also been overturned by higher courts .\nMichigan \u2019 s ability to handle a flood of ballots will be closely watched in a state that was narrowly won by President Donald Trump in 2016 .\nSecretary of State Jocelyn Benson last week said 2.7 million people had requested absentee ballots , a result of a change in law that makes them available to any voter .\nMichigan law says absentee ballots must be turned in by 8 p.m. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But Court of Claims Judge Cynthia Stephens had ordered that any ballots postmarked by Nov. 2 could be counted if they arrived within two weeks after the Nov. 3 election .\nStephens said there was \u201c unrefuted evidence \u201d about mail delivery problems because of the coronavirus pandemic .\nShe said more than 6,400 ballots arrived too late to be counted in the August primary .\nThe appeals court , however , said the pandemic and any delivery woes \u201c are not attributable to the state.\n\u201d \u201c Although those factors may complicate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not automatically amount to a loss of the right to vote absentee , \u201d the court said , noting that hundreds of special boxes have been set up across Michigan .\nThe court also reversed another portion of Stephens \u2019 decision , which would have allowed a non-family member to deliver a completed ballot in the final days before the election if a voter consented .\n\u201c The constitution is not suspended or transformed even in times of a pandemic , and judges do not somehow become authorized in a pandemic to rewrite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the policymaking branches of government , \u201d Judge Mark Boonstra said in a separate , 10-page concurring opinion .\nBenson and Michigan Attorney General Dana Nessel , both Democrats , had declined to appeal Stephens \u2019 rulings , leaving it to the Republican-controlled Legislature to intervene .\n\u201c Happy to see this unanimous ruling to uphold the integrity of our elections process and reject judicial overreach ,

Election Day , \u201d the party said .\nThe case was heard by appeals court judges Boonstra , Michael Gadola and Thomas Cameron .\nAll were appointed by Rick Snyder , a Republican , when he was

\u2019 \u2013 a spurious claim , by any reasonable standard , that has gone virtually unchallenged by mainstream media and even many Republicans seeking to \u2018 distance \u2019 themselves from the

feature .\nThe debate format will feature each candidate providing a two-minute opening statement on a range of topics , following by an open discussion on a range of topics selected by the moderator , NBC News correspondent Kristen Welker .\nThe debate topics selected are as follows , along with our brief commentary on what to watch for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u201d \u2013 Trump should be prepared for more unfounded claims that he \u2019 s killed people , and have a strong and coherent rebuttal ( which he \u2019 s yet to really provide ) .\nBiden will likely have to defend his national mask mandate idea again and how more lockdowns won \u2019 t further tank the economy .\n\u2022 \u201c American Families \u201d \u2013 The two candidates need to make their closing arguments on their economic agendas for the country .\nExpect for Trump to go hard on Biden \u2019 s tax @ @ @ @ @ @ @ something more substantive than \u201c good paying jobs \u201d and would do well to address small business owners who \u2019 ve suffered greatly under their states \u2019 lockdown measures .\nTrump will bring up summer street mobs and protecting suburbs .\n\u2022 \u201c Race in America \u201d \u2013 Biden : \u2018 It \u2019 s about systemic racism\u2026 \u2019 Trump : \u2018 I do more for the African-American community\u2026 \u2019 but law and order will also be part of the conversation and it \u2019 s sure to get ugly .\nWatch out for an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this section of the debate .\n( More on this below . )\n\u2022 \u201c Climate Change \u201d \u2013 This topic has been included in every debate thus far and has received little post-debate attention .\nExpect to not learn anything new here .\nIt plays like a time filler .\nBut do look for Trump to pivot the conversation to fracking and energy policy , or at the very least troll Biden into talk about the Green New Deal .\n\u2022 \u201c National Security \u201d \u2013 This is Trump \u2019 s golden @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the bigger picture of how Biden is a compromised and corrupt candidate on the international stage .\nIf Trump really wants to go for the jugular , he might paraphrase his former advisor Steve Bannon who recently said in a recent interview that Biden \u2018 couldn \u2019 t get a security clearance \u2019 as a sitting president .\nIf he does , this is a potential debate knockout punch .\nSadly , there won \u2019 t be any talk of ending foreign wars by either side , but we hope we \u2019 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u201d \u2013 Biden will do as he always has and attempt to stand on the shoulders of his former boss , President Barack Obama .\nLook for Trump to go on the attack lumping Biden into Obama \u2019 s failed policies \u2013 an attack line used successfully against Hillary Clinton in 2016 .\nWith Obama now stumping hard for Joe in battleground states , this has likely ignited Trump \u2019 s fuse on this topic once again .\n\u2022 Wildcard Topic \u2013 Every debate has at least one , and don \u2019 t @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Judge Amy Coney Barrett to the U.S. Supreme Court will not get injected into this debate somehow by Trump .\nAnd once again , Biden will be forced to admit he \u2019 s not going to provide answer just yet .\nBiden \u2019 s so-called \u2018 Progressive \u2019 supporters will be listening attentively .\nThe new twist for this debate will be the introduction of a mute button that will be deployed during the opening statements by each candidate on the debate topics .\nThe aim is to have Trump and Biden @ @ @ @ @ @ @ while the other candidate provides their initial answer on the topic question .\nDespite all the pumped up hype over the new mute button for the final debate format \u2014 that it will somehow leave Trump hamstrung and remove his \u201c go-to debate move \u201d of interrupting ( CNN actually reported that ) \u2014 in reality it can potentially hurt Trump and help Biden but for completely other reasons on Thursday \u2019 s debate stage .\nSince this will be a new feature introduced into the live production , you can bet it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or misused by either the moderator , Welker , or the producers at NBC News .\nIt \u2019 s still not clear exactly how the feature will be deployed and who will have access to it throughout the debate .\nThat appears to be by design .\nFor these reasons , we do predict there will likely be at least one instance of the mute button being pushed during one of the candidate \u2019 s so-called \u2018 uninterrupted \u2019 time or even during their \u2018 open \u2019 rebuttals .\nLook for Trump \u2019 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u2019 during one of his rants , possibly while accusing Biden of corruption with Ukraine and/or China if the network deems it to be unacceptable and decides to dump it .\nDuring Biden \u2019 s speaking time , look for a \u2018 gliche \u2019 in the system that occurs when Joe loses his train of thought and begins to drift into a nonsensical tangent that would reflect badly on him in front of a live , national audience .\nIt \u2019 s all a stage managed event , in the end \u2014 not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A new mute button is just another level of control .\nWatch carefully and don \u2019 t be fooled .\nIf it

room deals substitute for a free , fair and open process .\nPowers in charge of counting votes matter , not individuals casting them with no say over how the US is run or by whom .\nThis year , mail-in ballots are more important than ever .\nAround 100 million US voters exercised their franchise this way .\nAfter Wisconsin and Michigan were dubiously called for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by a 264 \u2013 214 Electoral College margin \u2014 270 needed to win .\nUnless Trump team court challenges overturn results in one or more contested states \u2014 a long shot but possible \u2014 DJT needs to win the four remaining undecided battleground states for a second term : Pennsylvania , North Carolina , Georgia and Nevada .\nHere \u2019 s where things stand in those states : Pennsylvania : With 89 % of votes counted , Trump \u2019 s earlier near-double-digit lead narrowed to a 2.6 % margin .\nNorth Carolina : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Trump leads Biden by 1.4 % of the votes .\nGeorgia : With 98 % of votes

by around two points , a far lower margin than most polls predicted .\nAccording to Federalist political editor John Daniel Davidson , Dems \u201c are trying to steal the election in Michigan , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ counting irregularities.\n\u201d He maintains that Dems \u201c flooded the election with millions of fake ballots\u2026 \u201d It \u201c follow ( ed ) from the discovery that they LOST some 22

showed the Biden camp how many votes they needed to defeat Trump in the above states \u2014 then magically created them in Michigan and Wisconsin .\nIn Pennsylvania , ballots received post-election in envelopes with no postmark are being counted .\nWere they mailed or ballot-box stuffed by different means ?\nWhile a post-election assessment of Tuesday \u2019 s process remains to be made once

things now stand , it appears that they want Biden/Harris to replace DJT .\nChallenges by Trump \u2019 s team may delay the outcome for an unclear number of days or longer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to halt voting in Pennsylvania and Michigan .\nBallot-counting in Georgia was challenged , along with a recount sought in Wisconsin .\nChatham County , Georgia election officials were sued by the Trump team ,

for its intended purpose \u201d : The examiner reports identified multiple hardware and software issues that preclude the Office of the Texas Secretary of State from determining that the Democracy

devices do not meet the standards for certification prescribed by Section 122.001 of the Texas Election Code .\nThe voting and tabulation machines made by Dominion caused problems and raised doubts about the accuracy of 2020 election results in at least two key swing states , Michigan and Georgia , according to multiple reports .\nAntrim County , Michigan , traditionally a Republican stronghold , had the Democrat , Joe Biden , beating Donald Trump by roughly 3,000 votes \u2013 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ technology , and later corrected by election officials , eventually netting Trump a 2,500 vote advantage in the final results .\nIn Georgia , other \u2018 glitches \u2019 stopped voting in both Morgan and Spaulding Counties \u2013 caused by a software update that was uploaded to voting machines the day before the election .\nGwinnett County also experienced delays in reporting voting results due to a \u2018 software issue \u2018 with machines counting absentee ballots .\nDominion is also

the years I \u2019 ve covered elections , color revolutions and wars , and thus have had the unique opportunity to observe firsthand how the online consensus-building and narrative management sphere has evolved .\nThat said , nothing can quite compare to the bot-fest unleashed this past week by the DNC \u2019 s Biden-Harris campaign .\nIn terms of analytics , it dwarfs anything we \u2019 ve seen previously in terms of speed and scale .\nHyper-partisan online warfare is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This 2020 US Presidential Election has supplied more than a few ugly examples of this .\nThe biggest one so far has to be Jack Dorsey and Twitter \u2019 s iron curtain drop on the New York Post , who committed the offense of publishing damning evidence on the Biden family \u2019 s various overseas enterprises .\nThe high priests of information in San Francisco claimed the story violated their community standards .\nIt \u2019 s obvious that Twitter executives viewed this information as a threat to the Biden campaign and so they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ York Post \u2019 s social media account , but they also suspended anyone else who posted the story , including the White House Press Secretary .\nAs for the rest of the mainstream media , they wouldn \u2019 t even cover it , and taking their cues from the Biden campaign , they summarily wrote it off a \u201c Russia disinformation.\n\u201d Yes , they did that .\nSo is this the new normal \u2013 allowing a Democrat-oriented corporation to censor important information across its ubiquitous platform during a major election cycle ?\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u2019 s online operation , let \u2019 s briefly review some of the genealogy of real-world weaponized online political influence operations .\nOne of the first real-world operations I witnessed was Iran \u2019 s \u2018 Green Revolution , \u2019 which had an international diaspora element to it , but it was fairly obvious then that a good percentage of the impressive wave of English language tweets and social media posts was being driven by western agencies .\nBy that time , the US military \u2019 s information warfare unit was already using an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the current version of Hootsuite , enabling operators to manage hundreds of Twitter accounts simultaneously .\nThese same efforts were repeated for the Arab Spring , and specifically for the war on Syria , like with Iran , oriented mainly for western and international audiences , and with the expressed purpose of disseminating and managing specific narratives or points of view aligned with the objectives of the Pentagon and US State Department .\nThere were both western-based cells of activists , and also large boiler rooms too .\nThe same operation was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u2018 color revolution \u2019 in the winter of 2013-2014 , and later with the West \u2019 s prosecution of its war of attrition in the Donbass .\nSome of the leaders in this emerging field have been Israeli tech firms who \u2019 ve demonstrated to their clients an ability to manipulate political opinion and manufacture trends across broad user groups on the major social media platforms .\nIt \u2019 s crucial to note that these same covert cyber operations have also been used against western citizens by the Pentagon and its contractors \u2013 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ counter and suppress any media sources deemed to be either sympathetic to a country like Iran , or any alternative news source reporting factual information ( which Washington doesn \u2019 t like ) during a live military operation .\nLarge parts of this same technology are now germane to western political campaigns .\nMuch was made of Obama \u2019 s famed digital strategy in 2008 , but the real turbo-charged capability came into its own during the 2016 Presidential Election , and with Ted Cruz \u2019 s presidential primary campaign arguably running the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up to that point .\nAmong the organizations contracted by Cruz was the notorious Cambridge Analytica .\nAccording to Federal Election Commission ( FEC ) filings his campaign paid at least $ 750,000 to the big data firm who claimed to specialize in \u201c behavioural microtargeting , \u201d but in reality Cambridge was really subcontracting out to a myriad of digital firms who performed various tasks .\nPresumably one of those was a human troll and bot farm .\nSimilar digital services were also employed by both the Clinton and Trump campaigns in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u2019 ve been watching the Biden 2020 social media campaign with great interest , but shocked to see very little happening early on , despite the many hundreds of millions of dollars raised .\nIt really seemed like a hard sell .\nLike his campaign in general , Biden \u2019 s social media operation was a fairly mild affair in comparison to other campaigns .\nRather strangely , it \u2019 s only really become activated after the election on Nov 3rd .\nAside from their daily hashtag campaigns , the campaign \u2019 s @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up in the last 10 days , and it \u2019 s now engaging in swarming and public mobbing .\nI experienced it myself this week after commenting on one of Biden \u2019 s daily hashtag campaigns called \u201c Biden Won Day \u201d ( # BidenWonDay ) , presumably a PR effort to flood Twitter with pro-Biden messaging to counter the growing public skepticism over contested election results .\nWithin just around 2 minutes of me posting the comment , hundreds of comments poured into the thread , mostly mindless one-liners , stand-alone hashtags @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other invectives .\nIn just 10 minutes there were already over 1,000 comments in the thread .\nWithin an hour it totaled nearly 2,000 replies .\nJust to reiterate , in all the years observing various social media campaigns , I have never seen anything like this .\nWhat was generating this instant waterfall ?\nWhile some of the many thousands of tweets in this thread could very well fall under the banner of human user ( we checked a sample of roughly 50 accounts , and at least half appeared to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was obvious there was some degree of automation , and had all the characteristics of a troll farm .\nAfter a bit of research into the Biden-Harris digital operation , I found a likely answer to my question .\nIt \u2019 s no secret to anyone in the digital subcontracting business that India \u2019 s troll farm industry is the largest in the world .\nIt boasts a global clientele , and it is also the cheapest , and most decentralized and robust in the world .\nThis service is available for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ western PR agencies , fashion brands , entertainment companies , and political campaigns .\nThe more money you have , the more online muscle you can flex .\nAs it turns out , in 2020 one of this shady industry \u2019 s biggest and best paying clients has been the Biden-Harris campaign .\nAs one troll farm operator in India told Newsweek recently , \u201c We don \u2019 t pick and choose .\nJoe Biden the person is irrelevant to us .\nWe got a target in August to follow him and engage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nThe agencies in Delhi who we work with don \u2019 t tell us any details , and we don \u2019 t ask.\n\u201d With very little popularity online and with the election drawing near , in August the Biden campaign reached out to troll farms in India in order to artificially boost Joe \u2019 s lack luster Twitter presence , and received an immediate injection of tens of thousands of fake followers which were literally purchased from troll farms located throughout rural India .\nOn this point , Newsweek added : If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ t these the very same practices that federal law enforcement agencies spent the last four years condemning as systemic during the 2016 presidential election ?\nPolitically , this should have consequences , but the media are hardly interested in advancing the story .\nRegardless , it does mean that Joe Biden lied when he made his grandiose announcement in June of 2020 pledging , \u201c not take part in the spread of disinformation over social media in his campaign for president , including rejecting the use of deep fake videos , synthetic social @ @ @ @ @ @ @ opponents.\n\u201d So much for honesty .\nSomewhat ironically ( or not ) , it was during Kamala Harris \u2019 s failed primary campaign which claimed it was under siege by armies of \u201c Russian bots.\n\u201d Upon closer examination though , her wild claims turned out to be hollow indeed .\nStill , her story was dutifully laundered through most mainstream outlets .\nDuring her appearance on The Breakfast Club radio show , Harris was asked point blank if she thought she was being targeted by Russian bots , to which she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know we are.\n\u201d The story was so outlandish that even CNN was forced to walk it back after it emerged there was no evidence to support her tale .\nShe literally made it up .\nSo much for character .\nTo buttress the Democratic Party narrative of \u2018 foreign interference \u2019 during this election , partisan journalists at major outlets like the New York Times churned out a steady stream of colorful stories warning of the specter of Russian bots , seemingly laying in waiting to attack the Biden-Harris campaign .\nOutlets @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u2018 how-to \u2019 pediatric online slide shows ( for adults ) supposedly teaching hapless voters how to be vigilant against malicious phantom bots , and how to achieve personal resilience and not be swayed by \u2018 disinformation.\n\u2019 Of course , these mythical legions of Cozy Bears never materialized , but the narrative was planted by the Democratic Party and the mainstream media , providing a pivot point if they ever need to leverage and re-spin the narrative later .\nWhat was also apparent from the testimony given to Newsweek is that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ working for slave wages .\nWhile the US-based digital consultants may be charging thousands per day to the Biden-Harris campaign , it \u2019 s all but certain that they \u2019 re paying mere pennies ( Rupees ) when they sub-sub contract-out to overseas troll farms .\nAgain , additional irony for Kamala Harris being of Indian decent that her campaign is employing slave labor in India to help prop-up its digital facade .\nThis sordid practice harkens back to December 2019 when it was revealed that Democratic Party financier , billionaire oligarch Micheal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to make phone calls for the former New York mayor \u2019 s failed Presidential campaign .\nAgain , clever sub-contracting solutions by the campaign \u2019 s ethically vacant gold-plated PR and digital consultants .\nMuch was made by Twitter over alleged \u2018 foreign meddling \u2019 by bot accounts on its platform during previous US election cycles , so you \u2019 d think that Silicon Valley firms would want to clamp-down on any paid-for abuse on their social networks , as it distorts and ruins the normal ebb and flow of communal discourse on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wave by the Biden camp further demonstrates that the likes of Twitter and Facebook are only really concerned with either imaginary threats ( \u201c the Russians !\n\u201d ) , or any pro-Trump activity or news which might damage the public messaging of campaigns they are favoring , in this case Joe Biden \u2019 s .\nThis completely one-sided approach to censorship and de-platforming is egregious in the extreme , and should be classed as election meddling and interference by Twitter and Facebook .\nThe Biden campaign are literally purchasing foreign online assets @ @ @ @ @ @ @ order to both inflate its presence online and also to attack critics , swarm the threads of journalists , and Trump supporters .\nAgain , these are the very same tactics and online behaviors which Democrats and their media surrogates have been waving the finger of righteous indignation at for the last four years , and which have been used to tie-up the resources of the federal government to probe and investigate ( and finding nothing to substantiate their claims in the end ) this supposed grave threat to our national security .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ Twitter and Facebook are now aggressively policing , \u2018 fact check \u2019 road-blocking , and even censoring anyone who dares to question the election results and bestowed legitimacy of \u201c President Elect \u201d Joe Biden .\nThis may be standard fayre in China , but we are meant to be living in a pluralistic society .\nAllowing these firms to suppress information and discourse during a historic election is frankly unforgivable , and should prompt a criminal investigation at the federal level .\nThe truth of matter : hypocritical partisans in the mainstream @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the Biden-Harris campaign , are doing more damage to trust in democracy and the Fourth Estate than anything Russia could ever dream of , or want to for that matter .\n*** Author Patrick Henningsen is an

American citizens , but in recent years it has begun the shift away from some of these core fundamentals and has instead become a weapon in the culture wars .\nThis latest episode is shocking , but

and donor anger over the defense by ACLU lawyers of the right of white supremacists to march ( after one killed a protester with his car ) but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that free speech case .\nRomero insisted to me that the ACLU had not retreated from its historic commitment to free speech nor its resolve to avoid partisan politics despite a series of post-Charottesville memos and a highly-funded election campaign that certainly gave the opposite appearance .\nNumerous ACLU staffers told me that one of the most vocal and effective advocates for a more \u201c nuanced \u201d free speech approach was Chase Strangio , the ACLU \u2019 s Deputy Director for Transgender Justice of its LGBT & HIV Project , who I also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ excellent lawyer who earned my admiration from his years of dedication

with no sense of shame opens up to public gaze the the cynicism , callousness and sheer power-crazedness of US policy on Syria , conducted as though it were a video game or a game of Monopoly .\nYou can read the Al-Monitor piece here : Outgoing Syria envoy reflects on Turkey , the Kurds and what everyone got wrong .\nUS Special Representative for Syria Engagement James Jeffrey at Syria-Turkish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jeffrey makes no bones about it .\nIt \u2019 s not about ending the Syrian conflict , it \u2019 s about prolonging it : Basically , first and foremost is denial of the [ Assad regime ] getting military victory\u2026.And of course , we \u2019 ve ratcheted up the isolation and sanctions pressure on Assad , we \u2019 ve held the line on no reconstruction assistance , and the country \u2019 s desperate for it .\nYou see what \u2019 s happened to the Syrian pound , you see what \u2019 s happened @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it \u2019 s been a very effective strategy\u2026 .\nThe point is , this [ preserving the SDF ] is our plan B .\nWe have a plan A .\nPlan A doesn \u2019 t answer \u2018 how does this all end ?\n\u2019 Plan A \u2019 s whole purpose [ is ] to ensure that the Russians and Assad and the Iranians don \u2019 t have a happy answer to how this all ends , and maybe that will someday get them to accept Plan B .\nMeanwhile , they \u2019 re @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u2019 t see Syria as a victory .\nSo , we don \u2019 t care a jot if Syrian people are suffering greatly , that \u2019 s part of the plan .\nWe are happy to prolong the suffering indefinitely as long as the Russians , Iranians and Assad can \u2019 t claim victory .\nPlan B , by the way , requires implementation on US terms of UN resolution 2254 , which would amount effectively to a suicide note for Assad as under those terms it would allow millions of Syrians outside @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fate of those still inside .\nAt no point in this lengthy interview does Jeffrey even mention the Syrian people .\nThe only Syrians ( condescendingly ) mentioned are the Kurdish militia SDF : The SDF , they \u2019 re clean kids .\nI \u2019 ve gotten to know them and their leadership very , very well .\nThey really are phenomenal , by Middle Eastern standards .\nThey \u2019 re a highly disciplined Marxist offshoot of the PKK .\nSo , let \u2019 s get this straight : the US is supporting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Syria to stop Assad getting the much needed oil for the Syrian people and is indifferent to the fact that Idlib is controlled by a bunch of Islamist fanatics ?\nJeffrey in fact does not say a single word about the character of the opposition to acknowledge their Islamist extremism , or about the likely consequences if Plan B were to succeed and deliver the keys of Damascus to Islamist radicals .\nIn this game \u2013 and a game is clearly how callous power-crazed Washington policy makers see it \u2013 only preventing victory @ @ @ @ @ @ @ emerges as relatively sensible , which is saying a lot .\nThe president was uncomfortable with our presence in Syria .\nHe was very uncomfortable with what he saw as endless wars .\n\u2026 Trump kept asking , \u201c Why do we have troops there ?\n\u201d The reason that Trump pulled the troops out was I think because he was just tired of us having come up with all these explanations for why we \u2019 re in there .\nWe at the State Department never provided any troop numbers to the president @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nWe didn \u2019 t try to deceive him .\nHe kept on publicly saying numbers that were way below what the actual numbers were , so in talking to the media and talking to Congress , we had to be very careful and dodge around .\nBut the Syria mission is the gift that keeps on giving .\nWe and the SDF are still the dominant force in [ northeast ] Syria .\n\u2018 Not our job ?\n\u2019 The deviousness of this is breathtaking .\nThe US State Department deliberately withheld @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to get their way on keeping their counters on the Monopoly board which for them is Syria .\nIt \u2019 s no surprise that someone of Jeffrey \u2019 s calibre boasts about helping Israel to pulverise Syria : We then also had the Israeli air campaign .\nThe US only began supporting that when I came on board .\nI went out there and we saw Prime Minister Netanyahu and others , and they thought that they were not being supported enough by the US military , and not by intelligence .\nAnd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ US government , and we won the battle .\nThe argument [ against supporting Israel \u2019 s campaign ] was , again , this obsession with the counterterrorism mission .\nPeople didn \u2019 t want to screw with it , either by worrying about Turkey or diverting resources to allow the Israelis to muck around in Syria , as maybe that will lead to some blow-back to our forces .\nIt hasn \u2019 t .\nAll that matters is \u2018 stabilizing the situation \u2019 to US advantage : So that was how we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nestled under the overall Iran policy .\nThe result has been relative success because we \u2014 with a lot of help from the Turks in particular \u2014 have managed to stabilize the situation .\nThe only change on the ground to the benefit of Assad has been southern Idlib in two and a half years of attacks .\nThey are highly unlikely to continue , given the strength of the Turkish army there and the magnitude of the defeat of the Syrian army by the Turks back in March .\nIt would be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nAs long as the US puts stymieing its adversaries ahead of any genuine concern for the suffering and prospects of the Syrian people , including the millions of refugees condemned by this policy to indefinite exile , no end is in sight .\nIt \u2019 s worth bearing in mind that Jeffrey worked with Obama long before he worked with Trump .\nAnybody who expects the Biden administration to follow a different path on Syria must be seriously deluded , unless by \u2018 different \u2019 is meant an even more reckless , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u2018 stabilising \u2019 .\nAnd there is no Trump there now to apply the brakes .\n*** Author Peter Ford is the former British Ambassador to Syria ( 2003-2006 ) and Bahrain ( 1999-2002 ) .\nThis article originally

News \u2018 Dana Blanton adds that \u201c [ m ] ost Democrats @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remember Trump as one of the worst presidents , up from 58 percent in 2016.\n\u201d Already prior to the election , Fox founder Rupert Murdoch was reported to have been distancing himself from his one-time favourite , which clearly resulted in Fox News becoming \u201c the first to call Arizona in Joe Biden \u2019 s favour.\n\u201d Subsequently , even India \u2018 s Narendra Modi and Israel \u2019 s Benjamin Netanyahu ( aka Bibi ) , two international allies of the U.S. Presdient , were among the first to \u201c congratulate the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Still , the President has his supporters too .\nAnd one should not forget that the 2016 election outcome was actually pretty close , or \u201c far more normal than coverage of the campaign would suggest , \u201d as expressed by the journalist Ezra Klein .\nIn fact , if not for the Electoral Colege , Hillary Clinton would have moved back to the White House in 2016 \u2013 Clinton receiving 65,853,625 votes ( 48.0 % ) and Trump , 62,985,106 votes ( 45.9 % ) , leading to the latter \u2019 s @ @ @ @ @ @ @ electoral votes .\nThe real meaning of this odd numbers

wider geographic reach , thereby arguably reflecting more accurately the will of the people in the whole of the nation , rather than expressing the volition of the inhabitants of a number of certain more populous ( and Clinton-leaning ) states .\nThe real-estate-developer-turned-political-leader \u2019 s journey to the White House started in the summer of 2015 .\nOn 16 June 2015 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u201c Donald Trump \u2019 s road to the White House started on an escalator \u201d in the Trump Tower , going down to make this announcement to the world : And that was how The Donald ( as he was

life in the U.S. , as seems to be the message of such popular movements like Black Lives Matter and its now all-encompassing ideology of Critical Race Theory .\nBut Trump has clearly also tapped into the wider population \u2019 s belief systems and mythological vocabulary , as exemplified in the phrase of the American Dream .\nThis ubiquitous phrase stems from the pen of the popular historian James Truslow Adams ( 1878-1949 ) and his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The candidate Trump promised to revive that defunct ideal , which primarily found expression in the advertising phrase \u2018 Make America Great Again \u2019 or MAGA , emblazoned upon innumerable hats on top of numerous Americans \u2019 heads \u2013 arguably leading to profitable sales figures of \u2018 official MAGA hats .\nThe only place you can buy the official hat is at the Trump Store.\n\u2019 The mere fact that Trump \u2019 s running mate-turned-vice president was clearly chosen to appeal to the religious right seems to underline the importance of Trump \u2019 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ narratives .\nThe sociologist Dr Philip Gorski , for instance , quite self-assuredly posits that \u201c Trump \u2019 s most loyal supporters were and are white evangelicals.\n\u201d Religion in the Trump Era : Speeding up the Rapture The past four years have seen a sudden resurgence of religion in the United States on a political level .\nIn his \u2018 folksy Midwestern drawl , \u2019 Trump \u2019 s Vice President , Mike Pence makes no bones about his personal bond with the good lord up above and his son , Jesus .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ the town of Anderson , in his home state Indiana , the VP finished his pep talk in this way : \u201c It \u2019 s a good time to pray for America .\n.\n.\nIf His people who are called by His name will humble themselves and pray , He \u2019 ll hear from heaven , and He \u2019 ll heal this land !\n\u201d Born into a Catholic family , Pence discovered his personal Jesus when he was in college , attending a \u201c contemporary Christian music festival.\n\u201d Sitting on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in 2017 , Pence told the crowd his personal conversion story : From that day forward , the one-time Catholic boy became a fervent Evangelical Christian , eager to please his Lord and keen to convert his fellow man .\nIt thus seems safe to say that Pence \u2019 s example persuaded \u201c fully eight-in-ten self-identified white , born-again/evangelical Christians \u201d to cast their vote for Trump in 2016 , as indicated by the Pew Research Center .\nBut not just the Vice President is eager to profess his faith , Trump \u2019 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ equally keen .\nIn October 2019 , Pompeo addressed the American Association of Christian Counselors in Nashville , Tennessee , with a speech insightfully entitled \u201c Being a Christian Leader.\n\u201d Trump \u2019 s close ties to Bibi , in combination with these two Christian leaders under his wing , have already made the White House move the U.S. Embassy to Israel to Jerusalem , in a theologically significant manner that Trump \u2019 s Evangelical base likely regards as the first step towards fulfilling God \u2019 s plan , as I explained in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the now U.S. Secretary of State adheres to even more outrageous points of faith .\nIn June 2015 , when Pompeo was but a Kansas congressman , he headlined a so-called \u2018 God and Country Rally \u2019 at Wichita \u2019 s Summit Church and there and then , Pompeo made this profession of faith : In fact , for Christian believers like Pence and Pompeo , \u201c returning Jerusalem to the Jewish people is a key to the second coming of Christ , \u201d which is also a prerequisite for the \u201c @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the above quotation .\nThe pastor , Dr Richard Mayhue elucidates that the \u201c English noun/verb \u2018 rapture \u2019 comes from the Latin noun raptura/verb rapio that is used 14 times in the \u201d New Testament .\nAnd though the noun and verb have different meanings and connotations , it is the \u201c perfect word to describe God suddenly taking up the church from earth to heaven as the first part of Christ \u2019 s second coming , \u201d adds Mayhue .\nBelievers like Pompeo , sometimes known as millenarianists , adhere @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the world to be imminent and the return of Jesus within reach .\nThat return will be followed by the establishment of a Divine Kingdom on earth , but before \u201c He establishes His kingdom on earth , Jesus will come for His Church , an event commonly referred to as the \u2018 Rapture.\n\u2019 At that time the dead in Christ will be raised and living Christians will be caught up to meet the Lord in the air and be with Him forever , \u201d as explained on a website emanating @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Chicago-based fundamentalist Christian institution of higher education established in 1886 .\nThese admittedly rather outlandish beliefs rely on the Bible , or rather on a literalist interpretation of scripture , as a reflection of the inerrancy of the Bible .\nAs expressed by the one-time Rapture enthusiast Harold Camping ( 1921-2013 ) , the \u201c Bible is God \u2019 s word .\nIn the original languages of the Bible , mainly Hebrew and Greek , every word , and every letter of every word , is from the mouth of God.\n\u201d This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back to an article published in the Princeton Review on 11 April 1881 .\nThe piece is called \u201c Inspiration \u201d and was written by Archibald A. Hodge ( 1823-86 ) and Benjamin Warfield ( 1851-1921 ) .\nHodge and Warfield claim that the \u201c scriptures not only contain , but ARE THE WORD OF GOD , and hence that all their elements and all their affirmations are absolutely errorless , and binding the faith and obedience of men.\n\u201d They thus put forward that \u201c God [ had been ] co\u00f6perating with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Holy Scripture.\n\u201d And that really means that the Trump White House has been conducting important parts of its foreign policy in accordance with very specific interpretations of particular Biblical precepts and judgements .\nOr , otherwise put , the real-estate-developer-turned-political-leader that is Trump has supervised Christian leaders to enact policy decisions they deem to be a direct reflection of the word of God .\nWhen Trump controversially visited St. John \u2019 s Church across the park from the White House on 2 June 2020 , using \u201c the federal force \u201d to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the resultant photo-op had him not coincidentally pose with a Bible in his hand .\nThe picture was clearly aimed at his Evangelical base , showing them that his guidance came from the inerrant Holy Scripture , defying Black Lives Matter protesters .\nA shocked world has now lived through four years of a Trump White House and is presently breathing a collective sigh of relief : \u201c World leaders have acknowledged \u2014 and even celebrated \u2014 the victory of President-elect Joe Biden and Vice President-elect Kamala Harris in the 2020 United @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unabashedly anti-Trump public-yet-corporate-sponsored American broadcaster NPR on 7 November 2020 .\nThis year \u2019 s election outcome had Biden gather no less than 81,283,098 votes ( 51.3 % or 306 electoral votes ) and Trump , 74,222,957 ( 46.8 % or 232 electoral votes ) .\nAs a result of this year \u2019 s special circumstances , many , supposedly Democratic leaning , voters opted for postal ballots , rather than casting their votes in person .\nHence the delayed outcome , victorious Democrats say .\nBut , Trump and his supporters are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\ninstead , they are crying foul loudly and have urged recount upon recount .\nThe news broadcaster CNN , exquisite purveyor of Fake News , in Trump \u2019 s words , \u201c reports that Trump not only insists he actually won the 2020 election but has maintained at times that he will not vacate the premises on January 20 , when his term ends.\n\u201d In contract , the U.S. media and a good part of the American population hold that Joe Biden won this year \u2019 s electoral contest and that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the White House .\nAnd that means that his VP will join him , a black woman of mixed Indian-Jamaican-American descent , Kamala Harris .\nBut that is still for next year , following the inauguration and the peaceful handover .\nThe fact that the Biden team picked a non-white woman for the job was a deliberate decision , a decision reflecting the prevailing mood in the country .\nThe United States , ( and parts of the rest of the world as well , ) are currently totally in the grip of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an ideology most people currently call \u2018 Social Justice \u2019 and its derivative popular outgrowth known as Woke culture .\nPresident-elect Biden is getting ready to replace Bible-beholden Trump and become a Woke president adhering to current ideological fashions and catch phrases .\nGoing back to 1977 and the publication of The Combahee River Collective Statement , the concept of identity politics is ubiquitous these days , which means that now \u201c everything is about race , \u201d as claimed by Ted G. Waechter in 2016 .\nActing accordingly , the President-elect is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of ethnic and/or sexual minorities to fill the spots : \u201c We \u2019 ll have more people of color than any Cabinet ever .\nWe \u2019 ll have more women than any Cabinet ever .\nWe \u2019 ll have a Cabinet of barrier-breakers .\nA Cabinet of firsts \u201d ( 16 December 2020 ) .\nUnder Biden , America \u2019 s war machine will be operated by a black man , Lloyd Austin , while U.S. trade representation will be handled by the \u201c first woman of color and first Asian American to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nThe position of Secretary of the Interior will be filled by Deb Haaland , a New Mexico native and member of the Laguna Pueblo tribe .\nAnd , \u201c Joe Biden will [ also ] nominate Pete Buttigieg to be his transportation secretary , \u201d turning his erstwhile presidential rival into the \u201c first Senate-confirmed LGBTQ Cabinet secretary.\n\u201d In this way , it is apparently expected that the appearance of the rulers of United States will more or less coincide with the actual make up of the bulk of the population @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to a large extent dominated by the Christian Bible and various resultant outlandish beliefs , the next four years seem set to be adhering to a secular religion of sorts , namely to the ideological construct usually referred to as Critical Social Justice \u2013 which is a concept that \u201c recognizes inequality as deeply embedded in the fabric of society ( i.e.\n, as structural ) , and actively seeks to change this , \u201d as postulated by \u00d6zlem \u015eensoy and Robin DiAngelo in their seminal 2012 book , Is Everyone Really Equal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ holding up the Bible , Biden is now clearly paying lip service to Black Lives Matter protesters and their many sympathizers in society at large \u2013 in this way .\nshowing himself to be Woke-in-Chief in spite of his advanced years .\nAs such , \u015eensoy and DiAngelo \u2019 s seminal text and the whole Critical Social Justice ideology have proven that ostentatiously secular constructs can also lead the way towards espousing blatantly outlandish beliefs .\nTaking the whole race discourse to its logical conclusion two black women , the real estate agent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Renee Walters have founded the Freedom Georgia Initiative , as a means to fulfill a mission of \u2018 Healing From Racial Trauma.\n\u2019 The project consists of 19 Black families who have collectively purchased 96.71 acres of rural land in Toomsboro , Georgia .\nThe aim is to develop a \u2018 self-contained Black community , \u2019 as a town of a few hundred people .\nIn other words , in order to overcome racism , this Initiative has effectively set up a segregated community where whites are not welcome as a way of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ black families.\n\u201d Whereas , the world of academia these days is in thrall of the unholy trinity of diversity , equity , and inclusion ( DEI ) and an academic like Dr Ibram X. Kendi propagates the idea that the \u201c opposite of \u2018 racist \u2019 isn \u2019 t \u2018 not racist.\n\u2019 It is \u2018 anti-racist \u2019 , \u201d which sounds as logical and counter-intuitive as instituting segregation to combat racism and discrimination .\nBiden clearly won \u2019 t be holding a Bible in his hand , but will instead have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chose from in order to be able to put the right words in his mouth while addressing his voters and their expectations .\nAt the same time , many people also express the hope that the Bidens in the White House will restore a sense of normality to the U.S. and its political life .\nIran \u2019 s President Rouhani , for his part , seemed to give voice to such an opinion when he said that \u201c [ w ] e are not overjoyed about Mr. Biden \u2019 s arrival , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u201d as reported by EHA News .\nBut Biden \u2019 s first task will be to tackle COVID-19 .\nThe Presdent-elect himself has come out saying that \u201c [ d ] ealing with the coronavirus pandemic is one of the most important battles our administration will face.\n\u201d Yet remaining realistic , also declaring that the \u201c end of the battle against COVID-19 is still months away.\n\u201d In his published plans to combat the health crisis , Biden recognizes the need to bring an end to the economic fallout produced by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been put in place .\nThe Biden Plan calls for a \u201c decisive economic response that starts with emergency paid leave for all those affected by the outbreak and gives all necessary help to workers , families , and small businesses that are hit hard by this crisis.\n\u201d Many blame Trump for the Covid fatalities in the U.S. and Biden wants to show himself as the leader who beat the virus and restored the nation to health .\nBut more than anything else , a Biden presidency aims to be a return @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that means continuity and not change , whatever the colour may be .\nPresident Obama continued George W. Bush \u2019 s war policies , with the former overseeing more drone strikes in his first year in the White House than the latter carried out during his entire 8-year presidency .\nAnd , Trump , in turn , did his best to outdo his predecessor as well .\nAnd now , it will be up to Joe Biden to continue this grand tradition after he has shuffled into the White House , all the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 21WIRE

think how the entire American media and political Establishment has been banging on ad nauseum for the last four years running , telling the public that the biggest threat to the integrity of their fragile western democracy and fleeting freedoms \u2013 was the Russians .\nWe \u2019 re now told that the Democratic Party \u2019 s opening act for the 2020 Presidential Elections \u2013 the Iowa Caucuses , has descended into chaos after the release of voting results from the state \u2019 s precincts were delayed due to \u201c inconsistencies in voter data \u201d which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a new digital mobile app commissioned by esteemed members of the party \u2019 s elite high committee .\nNormally , Iowa results are released a few hours after the polls close , but this year that didn \u2019 t happen .\nNumerous internal party arguments have now broken out , with opposing camps attacking different people , all but guaranteeing more in-fighting and controversy in what is already turning out to be the ultimate internecine war .\nThe biggest loser here , clearly , is front-runner Bernie Sanders , who has been deprived @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had with the announcement of a resounding victory in Iowa .\nAs a result of the chaos , more marginal candidates like Amy Klobuchar and Pete Buttigieg , are now claiming to have \u2018 won \u2019 the state , although it will be hard to tell

then , those may be contested now that confidence in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u2018 glitch \u2019 came about after Democratic Party activists manning some 1,700 precincts had downloaded the new app on their smart phones in order to submit voter data from the caucus sites , over to the party \u2019 s central headquarters .\nIt \u2019 s still unknown exactly how the app distorted the voting results , and will no doubt be the subject of much argument and speculation in the coming days and weeks .\nThe firm behind the shady app is called Shadow Inc , owned by the Democratic Party nonprofit group @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many of the people behind this new election technology are former Hillary Clinton staffers .\nThis may just be a coincidence , but it is certain to fuel existing distrust and skepticism among Democrat voters , especially in light of the previous exposure of how the 2016 Hillary Clinton campaign had colluded with the Democratic National Committee ( DNC ) operatives to prevent candidate Bernie Sanders from winning his party \u2019 s nomination .\nNone of this should come as any surprise to voters who have been raising the alarm about voting fraud @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this situation is unprecedented .\nMany suspected a scandal was afoot on Sunday , after it was announced that the traditional benchmark Des Moines Register poll of likely Iowa Democratic caucus goers \u2013 would not
