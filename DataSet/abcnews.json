impeachment trial of President Donald Trump : It \u2019 s just possible that common sense and reality have a shot at prying open the doors to the Senate chamber after all .\nAfter Republican senators claimed that it was perfectly reasonable to put a United States president on trial without hearing from any witnesses , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of recognizing that the truth matters .\nOr , at least , that the American people believe it does .\nWhat \u2019 s changed ?\nShocking but not surprising revelations from John Bolton \u2019 s book manuscript , which The New York Times reported over the weekend , have made impossible to ignore what everyone has known for months : President Trump withheld hundreds of millions of dollars in military aid to Ukraine to benefit himself politically , and against the strenuous objections of his top aides and both parties in Congress .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Utah , said , \u201c I think it \u2019 s increasingly likely that other Republicans will join those of us who think we should hear from John Bolton.\n\u201d It \u2019 s refreshing to hear those words .\nAnd yet the fact that such a statement is noteworthy at all tells you how far from responsible governance Republicans have strayed .\nThey hold 53 seats in the Senate , and yet the nation is waiting on just four \u2014 four !\n\u2014 to do the right thing and agree to call Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and other key witnesses to testify in Mr. Trump \u2019 s impeachment trial .\nA far more representative attitude in the Republican caucus was expressed by Roy Blunt , of Missouri , who said on Monday , \u201c Unless there \u2019 s a witness that \u2019 s going to change the outcome , I can \u2019 t imagine why we \u2019 d want to stretch this out for weeks and months.\n\u201d With this tautology Senator Blunt gives away the game : All witness testimony to date \u2014 all presented as part @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only strengthened the case against Mr. Trump , but Republicans will not vote to convict him under any circumstances .\nBy definition , then , no witness in the Senate could possibly change the outcome .\nThe reporting on Mr. Bolton \u2019 s manuscript , which is scheduled for publication in March , has scrambled that strategy .\nMr. Bolton \u2019 s foreign-policy disagreements with Mr. Trump have been public knowledge for months .\nLast fall , Fiona Hill , a Russia expert and former Bolton aide , testified in the House that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u2019 s aid-for-investigations scheme , which Mr. Bolton characterized as a \u201c drug deal.\n\u201d In the manuscript , detailed descriptions of which were leaked to The Times , he recounts nearly a dozen instances in which he and other top administration officials pleaded with Mr. Trump to release the aid , to no avail .\nHe describes Mr. Trump \u2019 s fixation on conspiracy theories about Ukrainian interference in the 2016 election , and about the supposed corruption of Marie Yovanovitch , the American ambassador to Ukraine .\nHe says that Secretary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him that he knew there was nothing to the theories regarding Ms. Yovanovitch , whom Mr. Trump fired last spring .\nMr. Bolton , a hard-line conservative with decades of service in Republican administrations , is no anti-Trump zealot , which makes his allegations against the president that much more devastating .\nAnd his decision to tell these stories publicly nearly certainly waives any claims of executive privilege Mr. Trump might try to assert over their communications .\nLet \u2019 s not forget the newly revealed evidence that came to light on Saturday @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recording released by the lawyer for Lev Parnas , who had worked for Rudy Giuliani , the president \u2019 s personal lawyer , in the Ukraine scheme .\nMr. Trump has denied even knowing Mr. Parnas , but on the tape the two men can be heard in conversation at a dinner in April 2018 .\n\u201c Get rid of her , \u201d Mr. Trump said of Ms. Yovanovitch .\n\u201c Get her out tomorrow .\nTake her out .\nO.K.\n?\nDo it.\n\u201d In a late-night tweet , Mr. Trump angrily @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u201c I NEVER told John Bolton that the aid to Ukraine was tied to investigations into Democrats , including the Bidens , \u201d Mr. Trump wrote .\nYou know what would be a good way to figure out who \u2019 s telling the truth ?\nSubpoena Mr. Bolton to testify under oath .\nThis isn \u2019 t a close call .\nA majority of Americans of all political stripes want to hear from Mr. Bolton , at the least .\nThey believe , as do congressional Democrats , that you can \u2019 t @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from office without getting the fullest possible account of his alleged offenses .\nBut Senate Republicans have so far refused to hear from any witnesses or to demand any documents , following the lead of Mitch McConnell , the majority leader , who has never hesitated to undermine the country \u2019 s institutions if he thinks doing so will help his party .\nMr. McConnell and nearly all in his caucus seem to imagine that if they block their eyes and ears and let their mouths run , the turbulence of impeachment will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strategy .\nOne reason good lawyers insist on deposing witnesses and subpoenaing documentary evidence is to avoid any unwelcome surprises at trial .\nMr. Bolton has now provided the latest of those surprises .\nIt is surely not the last .\nThe most galling part is that Republicans have already admitted how bad the president \u2019 s behavior was .\nBack in September , Senator Lindsey Graham , the South Carolina Republican and one of Mr. Trump \u2019 s staunchest defenders , said : \u201c What would \u2019 ve been wrong is if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ government that if you don \u2019 t do what I want you to do regarding the Bidens , we \u2019 re not going to give you the aid .\nThat was the accusation ; that did not remotely happen.\n\u201d Except that it did , as Mr. Bolton is apparently willing to say under oath .\nRepublicans don \u2019 t want him to do that because they don \u2019 t want Americans to exercise the simple good judgment that Mr. Graham once did .\nThe Washington Times on the suspension of Felicia Sonmez @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : Felicia Sonmez , a

Bryant violated The Post newsroom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , to recap : A Washington Post journalist was suspended for the \u201c crime \u201d of tweeting a link to a factual article about a famous celebrity who

Chicago-area Holocaust remembrance in 1985 .\n\u201c I was healthy and went to the labor camp while the rest of my family went the other way.\n\u201d The terror at Auschwitz was both systematic and indiscriminate .\nThe Germans murdered 1.1 million people at the extermination camp in Nazi-occupied Poland .\nMost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were gassed , shot or beaten to death .\nThousands of inmates survived , though barely , as slave laborers .\nSome worked in mines or rock quarries .\nSome sorted the confiscated possessions of others prisoners to be shipped back to Germany .\nOne small group , surely

brutalized were sets of twins who became the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ experiments .\nMost were killed afterward so their bodies could be dissected .\nOne pair was sewn together as if to create a conjoined set .\nThey died of gangrene .\nEva Kor remembered being tied down and stuck with a needle .\n\u201c They wanted to know how much blood a person can lose and still live , \u201d she said years later .\nOn

@ @ @ .\nOn the 40th anniversary in 1985 , ABC News anchor Peter Jennings visited Auschwitz with Elie Wiesel , the Nobel laureate and Auschwitz survivor , to consider the horror of Nazi genocide .\nJennings asked a logical question : How could the Jews of Europe have become victims in their own countries ?\nHow did they not recognize the German intention to exterminate the Jews ?\nWhy did they seemingly submit so easily ?\nWiesel had taken up this same question in his acclaimed memoir \u201c Night , \u201d in which Moishe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after he survived a far-off Nazi massacre .\nNo

\u2019 s Final Solution was too well-conceived to fail : \u201c We came from one world into another , \u201d Wiesel said .\n\u201c The killers killed and the victims died and the sky was blue and

to a religious issue that he \u2019 s staked repeated claim to : the global freedom to worship .\nThe day after Trump touted his support for domestic religious liberty in his State of the Union address , the State Department rolled out a list of 26 nations that have joined the International Religious Freedom Alliance .\nTrump lauded the alliance in Thursday remarks at the National Prayer Breakfast , vowing that his administration is \u201c @ @ @ @ @ @ @ minorities all around the world , like nobody has ever done.\n\u201d But the president \u2019 s elevation of global religious freedom

government , and Austria .\nThat member nations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for religious freedom , \u201d Campbell added , is \u201c shocking , and a continuation of this very narrow perspective of what religious freedom is \u201d that the administration has put forth .\nSecretary of State Mike Pompeo , addressing representatives from the member nations in Washington on Wednesday night , lauded them as \u201c an alliance of like-minded partners who treasure and fight for international religious freedom for every human being.\n\u201d While Trump took flak from some on the left for leading with Christian references in his invocations of religious freedom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ minority populations that include the Yazidi sect in Iraq and the Rohingya Muslim population in Myanmar .\nAndrew Lewis , an associate

places where they \u2019 ve not been as supportive.\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ s slashing of the nation \u2019 s refugee admissions cap , a move that limited resettlement options for some religious minorities who face persecution at home .\nSupporters of the administration \u2019 s work on international religious freedom , which is also led at State by ambassador-at-large Sam Brownback , lauded the alliance as a substantive sign that religious freedom is becoming a higher global priority .\n\u201c We \u2019 re very confident at this point that the priority is going to be focused on religious freedom as a broad human rights issue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ director at the Christian human rights advocacy group 21Wilberforce .\n\u201c That includes people who have theistic beliefs and people who have nontheistic

President Donald Trump more evidence for his assertion that the economy is flourishing under his watch .\nIt may also complicate the argument his Democratic presidential rivals are making that the

, have built campaigns around the argument that the middle class has been mostly left out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ served the wealthy .\nHow the election plays out will likely at least partly depend on whether

in Friday \u2019 s jobs report , though his Democratic opponents can cite some evidence for their contrasting views , too .\nRobust hiring has picked up from earlier this year , when the trade war

\u2014 ages 25 through 54 \u2014 who either have a job or are looking for one has reached its highest point since September 2008 , just before the recession intensified .\nEconomists typically focus on the prime-age population because it filters out the effects of retirement among the vast baby boomer generation .\nTrump officials are also stressing that the job market is now benefiting a wider range of demographic groups .\n\u201c We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Asians , young people , women \u2014 all ... are either at their all-time employment lows or very nearly so , \u201d Larry Kudlow , the White

jobs often pay less than factory jobs of the past .\nWages are also a mixed bag .\nHourly pay rose 3.1 % in January from a year earlier , a decent pace but below a peak of 3.5 % reached last summer .\nThe last time the unemployment rate fell below 4 % , in the late 1990s , wages were rising much faster \u2014 about 4.5 % annually .\nStill , pay is picking up for many low-income workers , a trend that Trump has repeatedly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of workers , wages rose 4.6 % year-over-year in December , the most recent month for which data is available , compared with 3 % for the richest quarter , according to the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta .\nThose outsize gains began in 2015 and have been fueled in part by higher minimum wages in many states .\nYet there are many soft spots in the economy that Democrats can work with , Furman said .\nFor example , a Congressional Budget Office report in December concluded that Trump \u2019 s 2017 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The CBO , a nonpartisan institution , forecasts that the richest 1 % of Americans will enjoy roughly triple the gains in after-tax income compared with the bottom fifth .\nNor has the economy \u2019 s growth reversed

Bulger juror says she regrets murder conviction", "content": "EASTHAM , Mass .\n-- The notorious crime boss James \u201c Whitey \u201d Bulger terrorized Boston from the 1970s into the 1990s with a campaign of murder , extortion , and drug trafficking , then spent 16 years on the lam after he was tipped to his pending arrest .\nIn 2013 , Janet Uhlar was one of 12 jurors who found Bulger guilty in a massive racketeering case , including involvement in 11 murders , even after hearing evidence that the mobster was helped by corrupt agents in the Boston office of the FBI .\nBut now Uhlar says @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any of the murder charges .\nHer regret stems from a cache of more than 70 letters Bulger wrote to her from prison , some of which describe his unwitting participation in a secret CIA experiment with LSD .\nIn a desperate search for a mind control drug in the late 1950s , the agency dosed Bulger with the powerful hallucinogen more than 50 times when he was serving his first stretch in prison \u2014\u2014 something his lawyers never brought up in his federal trial .\n\u201c Had I known , I would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ charges , \u201d Uhlar told The Associated Press in a recent interview .\n\u201c He didn \u2019 t murder prior to the LSD .\nHis brain may have been altered , so how could you say he was really guilty ?\n\u201d At the same time , Uhlar says she would have voted to convict Bulger on the long list of other criminal counts , meaning he still would likely have died in prison .\nUhlar has spoken publicly about her regret before but says her belief that the gangster was wrongly convicted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reading a new book by Brown University professor Stephen Kinzer : \u201c Poisoner in Chief : Sidney Gottlieb and the CIA Search for Mind Control.\n\u201d The book digs into the dark tale of the CIA \u2019 s former chief chemist and his attempts to develop mind control techniques by giving LSD and other drugs to unsuspecting individuals , including colleagues , and observing the effects .\n\u201c It was encouraging to know I wasn \u2019 t losing my mind , thinking this was important , \u201d Uhlar said .\n\u201c It told @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mean , how many lives were affected by this ?\nWe have no idea.\n\u201d Gottlieb \u2019 s secret program , known as MK-ULTRA , enlisted doctors and other subcontractors to administer LSD in large doses to prisoners , addicts and others unlikely to complain .\nIn Bulger \u2019 s case , the mobster and fellow inmates were offered reduced time for their participation and told they would be taking part in medical research into a cure for schizophrenia .\n\u201c Appealed to our sense of doing something worthwhile for society , \u201d @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reviewed by the AP .\nBut nothing could have been further from the truth .\n\u201c The CIA mind control program known as MK-ULTRA involved the most extreme experiments on human beings ever conducted by any agency of the U.S. government , \u201d Kinzer said .\n\u201c During its peak in the 1950s , that program and it \u2019 s director , Sidney Gottlieb , left behind a trail of broken bodies and shattered minds across three continents.\n\u201d After Bulger was found guilty by Uhlar and the other jurors , a federal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plus five years .\nBut his life behind bars ended a little more than a year ago , at age 89 , when he was beaten to death by fellow inmates shortly after arriving in his wheelchair at the Hazelton federal prison in Bruceton Mills , West Virginia .\nNo criminal charges have been filed .\nAlthough much had been written about the CIA \u2019 s mind control experiments before Bulger \u2019 s trial , Uhlar said she knew nothing about them until she began corresponding with the renowned gangster following his conviction @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said , because she was troubled by the fact that much of the evidence against him came through testimony by former criminal associates who were also killers and had received reduced sentences in exchange for testifying against their former partner in crime .\n\u201c When I left the trial , I had more questions , \u201d she said .\nAfter Bulger started returning her letters , Uhlar noticed he often dated them with the time he had started writing in his tight cursive style .\n\u201c He always seemed to be writing at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the morning and when I asked him why , he said it was because of the hallucinations , \u201d Uhlar said .\nWhen Uhlar asked him to explain , Bulger revealed what he had already told many others : that since taking part in the LSD experiments at a federal prison in Atlanta , he \u2019 d been plagued by nightmares and gruesome hallucinations and was unable to sleep for more than a few hours at a time .\n\u201c Sleep was full of violent nightmares and wake up every hour or so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 57 , \u201d he wrote .\n\u201c On the Rock at times felt sure going insane , \u201d he wrote in another letter , referring to the infamous former prison on Alcatraz Island , in San Francisco Bay , where he was transferred from Atlanta .\n\u201c Auditory & visual hallucinations and violent nightmares \u2014 still have them \u2014 always slept with lights on helps when I wake up about every hour from nightmares.\n\u201d The mobster also recalled the supervising physician , the late Carl Pfeiffer of Emory University , and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the LSD , asking him questions such as , \u201c Would you ever kill anyone ?\nEtc.\n, etc.\n\u201d That questions struck a nerve with Uhlar .\nAfter hearing from Bulger about MK-ULTRA , \u201c as if I should have known about it , \u201d she visited him at a Florida federal prison on three occasions to discuss the experiments and started reading everything she could find about them .\nAt one point , she reviewed the 1977 hearings by the U.S. Senate Committee on Intelligence , which was looking into MK-ULTRA @ @ @ @ @ @ @ top-secret program .\nThe hearings included testimony from CIA director Stansfield Turner , who acknowledged evidence showing that the agency had been searching for a drug that could prepare someone for \u201c debilitating an individual or even killing another person.\n\u201d \u201c That \u2019 s just horrifying , in my opinion , \u201d Uhlar said .\n\u201c It opens up the question of whether he was responsible for the murders he committed.\n\u201d According to at least two of the several books written about Bulger and his life of crime , associates including @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they assumed Bulger would use the LSD experiments to mount an insanity defense , if he were ever caught and tried .\nBut in 2013 Bulger \u2019 s Boston attorneys , J.W .\nCarney Jr. and Hank Brennan , unveiled a novel defense in which they admitted Bulger was a criminal who made \u201c millions and millions of dollars \u201d from his gangland enterprise , but was enabled by corrupt law enforcement officers , especially those in Boston office of the FBI .\nNeither Carney nor Brennan would comment on their decision \u2014 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ s death .\nBut Anthony Cardinale , a Boston attorney who has represented numerous organized crime defendants , said he would have opted for an insanity defense , in part because of the abundant evidence against Bulger .\n\u201c I would have had him come into court like Harvey Weinstein , all disheveled , and in a wheelchair , \u201d he said .\nStill , Cardinale acknowledged there would have been challenges to presenting an insanity defense , including the fact that Bulger spent 16 years out-witting several law enforcement agencies , before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Monica , Calif. , where he \u2019 d been living quietly with his longtime girlfriend while on the FBI \u2019 s Ten Most Wanted List .\n\u201c The problem is , he lived for a very long time on the lam in a very secretive and a very smart way , \u201d Cardinale said .\n\u201c But that doesn \u2019 t diminish the notion that , based on the LSD experiments , and the doses he was experiencing , he could have convinced himself of things that were not true , including that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do whatever he wanted.\n\u201d To his dying day , Bulger insisted he \u2019 d received criminal immunity from a deceased federal prosecutor who once headed the New England Organized Crime Strike Force .\nJohn Bradley , a former Massachusetts federal prosecutor and assistant district attorney , agreed that defense lawyers would have faced high hurdles waging an insanity defense , noting that most end in convictions.\n\u201c The flip side is that jurors are sometimes swayed by morality more than legality , \u201d he said .\n\u201c The whole shtick that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ monster , uses him as an informant and then goes after him \u2014 that \u2019 s an argument that could affect one or two jurors.\n\u201d And it only takes one to vote not guilty on all the criminal charges to produce a hung jury , Bradly noted , forcing prosecutors to decide whether to retry a case .\nGiven Bulger \u2019 s decades as a crime boss who corrupted the Boston office of the FBI , paying cash and doing favors in exchange for information that helped him thwart multiple investigations , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ certainty .\nNevertheless , Cardinal said , a hung jury in the Bulger case \u201c would have been a monster victory \u201d for the defense .\nEven if Bulger were

off .\nFollowing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tweeted about \u201c how brave Patty Blagojevich is , \u201d McKinney said .\nAt one point , Trump told reporters on Air Force One that he thought Rod Blagojevich had

referring to Wuhan or China is payback for Chinese disinformation and for Beijing \u2019 s delay in letting the world know of the outbreak .\nOf course , it is possible to hold the Chinese government accountable for its handling of the crisis and its spread of misinformation without maligning a nation of more than 1.3 billion people or the people of Chinese descent who make their homes in nations

as states reopen and the economy , especially consumer confidence , start to pick up again .\nThose who can point to any positives under Trump \u2019 s watch are targets for belittling and bullying by the left .\nIt will be interesting to see who is laughing in November .\nThe Los Angles Times on President @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You have to say one thing for President Trump : He has yet to find a crisis he can \u2019 t try to exploit for his own political gain .\nTrump tweeted late Monday that he intends to sign an executive order halting all immigration to the U.S. ( never mind that closed government offices have already effectively made it impossible to immigrate legally ) ; reports out of the White House Tuesday said he intended to freeze new green cards for relatives of existing green card holders and for people expecting to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nNotably , he didn \u2019 t attribute the decision to fears that new arrivals could exacerbate the spread of the coronavirus , but because they would compete with U.S. workers for jobs , which have been disappearing at a stunning rate in recent weeks .\nTrump won election in part through bashing immigration , both legal and illegal , and has worked diligently since then to limit new arrivals while ramping up arrests of people here without permission .\nHe has sharply lowered the cap on the number of refugees accepted for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ asylum claims by denying them from people who did not present themselves at a legal port of entry .\nThat policy went into effect despite an immigration law that states plainly that any foreign national \u201c who is physically present in the United States or who arrives in the United States ( whether or not at a designated port of arrival\u2026 ) \u201d is eligible to apply .\nThe administration also has forced those applying at ports of entry to remain in Mexico while the lengthy process plays out .\nBut as the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nearly all non-trade traffic at the southern and northern borders \u2014 including asylum seekers .\nNow , citing the massive job losses from widespread stay at home orders , Trump intends to halt all immigration .\n\u201c In light of the attack from the Invisible Enemy , as well as the need to protect the jobs of our GREAT American Citizens , I will be signing an Executive Order to temporarily suspend immigration into the United States !\n\u201d the president tweeted .\nPress Secretary Kayleigh McEnany followed that up with a statement @ @ @ @ @ @ @ committed to protecting the health and economic well-being of American citizens as we face unprecedented times .\nAs President Trump has said , \u2018 Decades of record immigration have produced lower wages and higher unemployment for our citizens , especially for African-American and Latino workers.\n\u2019 At a time when Americans are looking to get back to work , action is necessary.\n\u201d But the president \u2019 s assertions just aren \u2019 t true .\nNumerous studies have found that new arrivals tend to take jobs that employers have trouble filling \u2014 often @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and involve hard physical labor .\nThose workers tend to compete with and dampen wages for the immigrants who preceded them into the country .\nBut the new arrivals also add to the economy and help create higher-paying , less physically strenuous jobs for native-born workers .\nAs the Brookings Institute reported in 2012 , \u201c immigrants and U.S.-born workers generally do not compete for the same jobs , \u201d and \u201c low-skilled immigrant laborers allow U.S.-born farmers , contractors , and craftsmen to expand agricultural production or to build more homes \u2014 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ U.S. workers.\n\u201d And they also help support local retail shops , restaurants and other businesses .\nThe economic impact of immigrant workers tilts heavily to the positive end of the scale .\nDoes that change during an economic crisis like this ?\nIn some ways , yes .\nIs it reasonable to declare a short-term hiatus ?\nPerhaps .\nBut that has already been put into effect by the shuttering of government offices that process visa applications , by the restrictions on travel , and by the collapse of the labor market @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for jobs that don \u2019 t exist ) .\nIt \u2019 s hard to assess whether the president \u2019 s metaphorical barricading of the border will help or damage the economy until we see what , exactly , he will do .\nBut bear in mind that the current disruption of the economy is not permanent , and that the president himself has argued vociferously for a ( too rapid ) lifting of the restraints on commerce .\nNo one can offer a reliable sense of what the future economy will look like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whether they are new-arriving immigrants or laid-off native-born Americans .\nIt \u2019 s no coincidence that his call for a ban on new immigrants dovetails with one of his signature campaign issues at a time when the vibrant economy he had planned to campaign on has cratered .\nThis is about saving one job \u2014 the president \u2019 s .\nThe Washington Post on protesters demanding businesses be reopened : Public fatigue with stay-at-home orders to fight the novel coronavirus pandemic is inevitable and understandable .\nNot understandable , nor forgivable , is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disrespect for his own government \u2019 s guidelines , which are unquestionably essential for the public health .\nRelatively small protests have broken out in the United States in recent days against the strictures designed to slow the spreading virus .\nPeople have a right to protest , if they conduct themselves without endangering others .\nBut leaders have an obligation to point out that the behavior the protesters are encouraging could reignite the virus and cost lives .\nTens of millions of Americans in recent weeks have willingly complied with stay-at-home guidelines @ @ @ @ @ @ @ governors , a commendable showing of cohesion and collective good judgment .\nFor many , it came at a steep personal sacrifice .\nNext will be hard choices about reopening .\nDoing so too soon risks reigniting a firestorm that has already cost more than 168,000 lives globally .\nOpening must be done with special protections , testing and data , as Mr. Trump \u2019 s own phased-in guidelines would suggest .\nThe protesters in the United States carried signs such as \u201c Live Free or Die in Lockdown \u201d and \u201c Re-Open @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bad example , without masks or social distancing .\nBut what was most concerning was the message that somehow all this sacrifice can be quickly abandoned in the name of liberty and rights .\nThis is wrong .\nThe pursuit of liberty does not mean a license to endanger the lives of others .\nMr. Trump was exceedingly reckless to incite protests with three tweets on Friday saying \u201c LIBERATE \u201d Michigan , Minnesota and Virginia , all of which have Democratic governors .\nHe undermined his own

additional disobedience and spark new outbreaks and another round of restrictions that would be even harder to impose .\nSuch a cycle must be avoided .\nThere is no arguing with the facts : The virus jumps from person to person and can kill .\nA responsible leader would express empathy with the millions of Americans who have followed the rules , reinforce why they are necessary and offer reasonable expectations about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this is to fail at a central function of the presidency .\nSome protests may reflect a genuine cry for help \u2014 from hunger , desperation and fear .\nThese voices must be listened to , and their needs addressed as fast and far as possible .\nIn the end , our fate in this pandemic will be determined by what we do now , in the months or more before a vaccine .\nWe must accept strategies that are working to keep as many people alive as possible .\nShouting \u201c liberate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Times on employers protecting essential workers : Shelter-in-place orders are an effective means to slowing the spread of the coronavirus , yet millions of Americans have no choice but to leave home to go to work every day .\nDeemed essential for their jobs in manufacturing , grocery stores , pharmacies , warehouses , retailing and restaurants , they face daily risks by working alongside colleagues and customers who may be carriers of the coronavirus .\nAt grocery stores and sprawling warehouses , workers say not enough is being done to protect them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ instance , say they lack sufficient sanitizing supplies and protective gear and are forced to congregate in spaces that put them well within a six-foot radius of co-workers .\nAt meat processing plants , where production lines often require working shoulder to shoulder , the risks are particularly acute .\nAnd mass-transit workers say they haven \u2019 t been provided masks or personal cleaning supplies .\nWhen their shifts end , they go home to their families , putting more people at risk .\nWeeks into the pandemic , it \u2019 s apparent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to protect these front-line workers , even as their continued labor ensures that a semblance of normality endures for their fellow Americans .\nThe Department of Labor \u2019 s primary worker safety enforcement arm , the Occupational Safety and Health Administration , has taken a largely hands-off approach to the pandemic .\nOnly last week did OSHA put a priority on investigating health care facilities for complaints about coronavirus safety procedures , while effectively giving a free pass to some of the nation \u2019 s largest employers .\nWithout a clear set of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them up as they go .\n\u201c As long as OSHA doesn \u2019 t take a position , these employers have a pass to say workers got sick elsewhere and it \u2019 s not their responsibility , \u201d said Marc Perrone , international president of the United Food and Commercial Workers union , which represents some 1.3 million laborers .\nThe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention issued sensible guidelines on the federal level that can protect workers , such as standards for social distancing , sanitizing stations and using masks in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made the guidelines mandatory for workplaces \u2014 the C.D.C .\nitself doesn \u2019 t enforce them \u2014 nor has OSHA adopted other new rules that could help ensure worker safety during the pandemic .\nIt should do so now .\nRequiring businesses to follow the C.D.C.\n\u2019 s guidelines would allow OSHA to enforce them with inspections and fines .\nInstead , a patchwork of rules \u2014 led primarily by governors in New York , Washington State and California \u2014 serve as an unsatisfactory substitute by mandating masks in all public settings and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But these haven \u2019 t been aimed specifically at workplaces , many of which need more guidance .\nOSHA said its prior rules for worker safety apply during the pandemic , though the agency last week did give agents leeway to investigate coronavirus claims so long as they were confined to health care facilities and met certain other criteria .\nIn a statement to The New York Times , OSHA said that \u201c employers are , and will continue to be , responsible for providing a safe and healthy workplace \u201d and that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a worker is killed or seriously injured on the job , known as the General Duty clause .\nThe agency \u2019 s Covid-19 guidance for employers , however , acknowledges upfront it \u201c is not a standard or regulation , and it creates no new legal obligations.\n\u201d In the meantime , OSHA offices are fielding thousands of coronavirus complaints but don \u2019 t have the wherewithal to investigate them .\nIn Oregon alone , by early this month the local OSHA office had received 2,747 complaints about workplace conditions but had issued @ @ @ @ @ @ @ told The Portland Tribune .\nAn OSHA official in Illinois wrote in an email to a local union that , though she had been receiving daily complaints for weeks , \u201c these recommended measures are not enforceable by OSHA since they are guidance and not OSHA law.\n\u201d OSHA also told a lawyer representing an Illinois Walmart worker who died after contracting the coronavirus that \u201c OSHA does not have any jurisdiction on enforcing anything related to Covid-19 at this time , \u201d according to The Milwaukee Journal Sentinel .\nAs part of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ companies should conduct their own investigations and report back to the agency .\n\u201c The message from OSHA to employers and their workers is : You \u2019 re on your own , \u201d said Debbie Berkowitz , a former OSHA official and now program director of the National Employment Law Project .\nThat means a formal complaint lodged with the agency \u2019 s California division , known as Cal/OSHA , by Amazon warehouse workers in Eastvale , Calif. , last week isn \u2019 t likely to result in an inspection , let alone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nWorkers there allege that , in Amazon \u2019 s rush to get customers their essential goods , they have had to work well within six feet of one another and aren \u2019 t given sufficient time or materials to sanitize their hands or their workstations .\nAmazon \u2019 s chief executive , Jeff Bezos , said the company was working on expanding testing capacity for its hundreds of thousands of workers and called for regular universal testing to arrest the virus \u2019 s spread .\nOSHA also can and should go beyond @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as staggered shifts and lunch breaks and construction of barriers to protect employees in jobs like manufacturing and meatpacking that require close quarters .\nAnd it should carefully evaluate updated C.D.C .\nguidelines that permit employers to bring some workers back to the job after potential Covid-19 exposure before a two-week quarantine .\nSome say the new policy , meant to keep essential businesses running , risks re-exposing workers .\nMinnesota \u2019 s Department of Health , by contrast , has maintained a recommendation for a 14-day quarantine for workers after exposure .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ tougher rules .\nDuring the H1N1 flu outbreak , it made C.D.C .\nrules enforceable , requiring the use of face masks and other measures to slow transmission .\nIt has failed to act so far this time , however .\nCompanies may say new rules would be onerous and expensive , but the cost of prolonging the coronavirus \u2019 s spread can be far more costly : Smithfield Foods was forced to indefinitely close its Sioux Falls , S.D.\n, plant \u2014 responsible for roughly 5 percent of the country \u2019 s @ @ @ @ @ @ @ impose safety measures even as hundreds of its workers contracted the virus .\nThe retailer Gap Inc. , by contrast , told customers this month to expect slower delivery times after voluntarily following C.D.C .\nguidelines .\nOSHA has taken steps to protect health care workers by prioritizing inspections of hospitals and other \u201c high risk \u201d facilities .\nBut during the pandemic , warehouses and slaughterhouses , city buses and grocery stores have become high-risk facilities , too .\nIf the spread of the disease is to slow , millions of workers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the anniversary of the Deepwater Horizon explosion : The traumatic events of the explosion and massive oil spill ensuing off the cost of Louisiana 10 years ago are hardly forgotten .\nMost of all , of course , the families of 11 men killed working on the Deepwater Horizon platform \u2014 another 17 were injured \u2014 had their lives forever altered in that moment of horror .\nThose were not the only families affected .\nSuch a massive spill damaged the coast of our state .\nThen-Gov .\nBobby Jindal mobilized a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coastline and wildlife .\nThousands of workers and volunteers helped .\nThe images of birds coated in oil made an indelible impression upon the American public and that of the rest of the world , as did video of oil still spewing out many days later .\nThe economic impact on our region was serious , with a decline in tourism and even people curtailing purchases of seafood .\nAfterward , there was that was the inevitable consequence of things going very badly : a government reorganization .\nA new bureau in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , safety procedures changed , a moratorium on offshore production was declared by the Obama administration .\nAnd just as inevitably , there were debates over the debate : Workers in the Gulf oil regions felt they were being penalized by BP \u2019 s mistakes , companies criticized revisions in safety procedures .\nAnd the latter debates continue today , with environmentalists arguing that the Trump administration has further eroded the complex safety rules that underlie oil and gas production in offshore .\nFor those with shorter memories , the way that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the news is in the payouts of billions of dollars to governments as well as nonprofits in civil and criminal penalties levied on BP and other responsible companies .\nThose are long-lasting , in that the payments are large .\nThose payments have begun and will fund coastal protection and restoration efforts for some years to come .\nThat may be a lasting legacy of the events of a decade ago , although benefits that were purchased at the cost of lives and huge environmental and economic consequences .\nLouisiana remains at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even if recent events have driven prices for those commodities to lows not seen in decades .\nAnd Louisiana \u2019 s coastline continues to be a rich and varied economic and environmental asset for fisheries and tourism , even if recent events involving coronavirus outbreaks have also sharply diminished those activities as well .\nWe see two permanent lessons .\nOne is that economic progress , while important , can not override safety for humans or for the environment we hold in trust for future generations .\nAnother is that Louisiana \u2019 s @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and while the BP settlement pays for a lot , it \u2019 s not enough .\nAmerica paid attention 10 years ago .\nLet \u2019 s hope the U.S. government continues to help , a lot , in future years .\nThe Toronto Star on the mass killings in Nova Scotia : Over and over , the same phrases were uttered by men and women across Nova Scotia .\n\u201c Surreal.\n\u201d \u201c Senseless.\n\u201d \u201c No words.\n\u201d \u201c Why ?\n\u201d But the full measure of shock and grief at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ t come from the lips .\nIt came from the eyes .\nHaunted , red , glazed , bewildered .\nEyes seeking , in some obscure middle distance , rational answers to a horrifically irrational act .\nA 51-year-old man cut a murderous swath through rural Nova Scotia from late Saturday night to Sunday morning , killing at least 18 people , leaving homes burned to the ground and cars torched at 16 separate crime scenes .\nOdds are it will get even worse .\nChief Supt .\nChris Leather , of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the death toll to rise as burned-out residences are searched .\nAs much as anyone , Prime Minister Justin Trudeau best described things when he said the slaughter , on top of the COVID-19 lockdowns that make it impossible for stricken family and friends to gather and mourn , is \u201c heartbreak on top of other heartbreaks.\n\u201d On hearing the news , he said , many Canadians probably asked themselves \u201c how much more can we take ?\n\u201d Trudeau has grown sadly familiar with the role of national consoler .\nCanadians @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at a Ste .\nFoy mosque and on Toronto \u2019 s Danforth , in the Yonge Street van attack , in the Humboldt Broncos bus crash , in the downing of Flight 752 .\nThe prime minister was able once again , by dint of emotional intelligence or political shrewdness , to strike the right notes .\nEven as Opposition Leader Andrew Scheer once again misread the moment , going on about the need for enhanced parliamentary sittings on a day when most Canadians could have cared less .\nThe newest devastation unfolded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the suspect eluding police for some 12 hours by driving a mock RCMP cruiser and wearing a police uniform remarkable in their detail .\nIt seems unlikely such extraordinary materials would have been assembled by someone who simply snapped .\nRather , they seem to suggest extraordinary planning .\nYet no one acquainted with the killer seems to have noticed anything untoward .\nLocal MP Lenore Zann said she heard from people who \u201c went to school with him , said he was such a nice guy , talked to him all the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fine.\n\u201d The rampage began in the community of Portapique , a cottage area so sleepy that signs around town spell it different ways .\nIt \u2019 s a place few Canadians had likely heard of , but a place that has become forever notorious after the killer left a list of dead that could have been pulled from a Tim Hortons ad .\nA grade-school teacher .\nA nurse .\nA volunteer firefighter .\nHealth-care workers from the Victorian Order of Nurses .\nIn the Commons , Trudeau said RCMP Const .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ , \u201c embodied the values that built this country .\nIntegrity , honesty , compassion.\n\u201d Trudeau acknowledged the acute pain of mourners being unable to come together .\nBut he and health authorities properly insisted that social-distancing measures in effect to combat the coronavirus pandemic must be maintained .\nGrieving will be done , but there will be few hugs .\nRather , a \u201c virtual vigil , \u201d in the style of spring , 2020 .\nOn Monday , there remained large missing pieces in the story and many unanswered questions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for example , did the killer

"source": "abcnews", "title": "Officials: US seeks indefinite UN arms embargo on Iran", "content": "UNITED NATIONS -- The United States has circulated a draft U.N. resolution that would indefinitely extend a U.N. arms embargo on Iran set to expire in October , a move almost certain to spark opposition from Russia , which has made no secret of its desire to resume conventional weapons sales to Tehran , U.S. officials and U.N. diplomats said Tuesday .\nThe draft document , which as of Tuesday had been circulated only to a small number of Security Council members , would strike the expiration of the arms embargo from the council resolution that endorsed the 2015 nuclear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , according to Trump administration officials and U.N. diplomats , who were not authorized to discuss the matter publicly and spoke on condition of anonymity .\nThe U.S. officials said the aim is to present the resolution for a vote in May when Estonia , a NATO member and close U.S. ally that is not party to the nuclear deal , holds the rotating presidency of the Security Council .\nThe arms embargo was not a part of the landmark 2015 accord , but Iran has long sought its removal and its expiration @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a reward for Iranian compliance with the agreement 's nuclear restrictions .\nSince Iran is admittedly no longer complying with several elements of the nuclear deal , according to the International Atomic Energy Agency , the administration believes it has a case to make that the embargo should not be lifted , the officials said .\nStill , any attempt to extend the embargo will likely face stiff opposition from Russia and China , two veto-wielding permanent members of the Security Council who have argued it should be removed and want to resume @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been more outspoken on the matter and has derided U.S. attempts to bring the matter up for discussion , criticizing President Donald Trump for withdrawing the U.S. from the nuclear deal in 2018 and re-imposing tough American sanctions on Iran .\nDespite that opposition , which is almost certain to see the American effort fail , the U.S. officials said the administration is not planning at this point to raise the controversial matter of \u201c snapback \u201d \u2013 or restoring all U.N. sanctions against Iran that had been lifted or eased under the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the administration pulled out from the deal two years ago , the U.S. maintains that it retains the right to invoke a sanctions snapback that the deal envisaged in the event of \u201c significant non-performance \u201d by Iran .\nThat position rests on a novel State Department legal argument that was first presented in December and asserts that although the U.S. is no longer in the nuclear deal , it remains an original \u201c participant \u201d under the terms of the Security Council resolution that enshrined it .\nThat resolution does , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 2015 agreement by name , but numerous diplomats have said the American argument is specious because the Trump administration has made such a point about no longer participating in the deal .\nThe U.S. risks sparking a diplomatic war and throwing the already damaged credibility of the Security Council into further jeopardy should it decide to invoke snapback because it is unlikely that either the Chinese or the Russians , and possibly other members , would go along with the re-imposition of U.N. sanctions or enforce them .\nThe Chinese , Russians and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ impact that the unilateral U.S. sanctions have had on Iran , crippling its oil

Investigation considering one of the suspects , Greg McMichael , was a former county officer ?\nWhat part did the Brunswick District Attorney \u2019 s Office play in the investigation since McMichael was also a former investigator for the office ?\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ the weekend when the district attorney and county commission , which was acting on behalf of the county police department , gave

.\nThe county \u2019 s official statement said the reason the county police didn \u2019 t involve the GBI right away was because none of the officers working the case were with the department when Greg @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to 1989 .\nThat was an incredibly shortsighted and naive decision by the individual who made it .\nThe county didn \u2019 t say who made that decision , leaving out a key detail in this puzzle .\nThe stink of impropriety would still be on the public \u2019 s mind , even if none of the people involved in the investigation didn \u2019 t work with McMichael when he was with the department .\nIt isn \u2019 t hard for someone to assume that he got preferential treatment because he was a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ needed to be free from all implications of bias .\nIt should have been turned over immediately to the GBI , something that has since been acknowledged by the interim county police chief Jay Wiggins , who was not chief when the shooting occurred .\nThe district attorney \u2019 s office also made a questionable call when it comes to perception of bias .\nWhile district attorney Jackie Johnson told The News the two assistant district attorneys recused themselves when contacted by police , police still needed legal advice .\nAccording to Johnson @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an attorney from the Ware County district contact police .\nThe only problem with that scenario was that George Barnhill , the Ware district attorney , had a familial connection to an assistant district attorney in Johnson \u2019 s office .\nWe have to imagine that Johnson knew about that connection and still thought it was best to contact Barnhill , who met with police the day after the shooting .\nThat decision is just as myopic as the county \u2019 s decision not to hand over the investigation to the GBI .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ bias free as possible , choosing someone who has a connection to the Brunswick District Attorney \u2019 s Office to provide legal advice for the police when one of the suspects is a former investigator for the DA was not the wisest decision .\nWho is to blame for the lack of action in the Arbery death has become the latest salvo in a political battle between the county and the

Infectious diseases are not conflicts between countries .\nNo military power is used .\nExpressions such as \u201c attack \u201d and \u201c war \u201d can cause people to lean toward condemnation of other countries , forgetting that the enemy is a virus .\nLeaders should avoid such easy analogies .\nThe Wall Street Journal on former President Barack Obama 's comments on the \u201c false statements \u201d case of former National Security Advisor Michael Flynn : Barack Obama is a lawyer , so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ventured into the Michael Flynn case in a way that misstated the supposed crime and ignored the history of his own Administration in targeting Mr. Flynn .\nSince the former President chose to offer his legal views when he didn \u2019 t need to , we wonder what he \u2019 s really worried about .\n\u201c There is no precedent that anybody can find for someone who has been charged with perjury just getting off scot-free , \u201d Mr. Obama said in the Friday call to about 3,000 members of the Obama Alumni @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Yahoo News and confirmed by Mr. Obama \u2019 s spokeswoman to the Washington Post and other outlets .\nMr. Obama added : \u201c That \u2019 s the kind of stuff where you begin to get worried that basic\u2014not just institutional norms\u2014but our basic understanding of rule of law is at risk .\nAnd when you start moving in those directions , it can accelerate pretty quickly as we \u2019 ve seen in other places.\n\u201d Even discounting for Mr. Obama \u2019 s partisan audience , this gets the case willfully wrong .\nMr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which is lying under oath in a legal proceeding .\nMr. Flynn pleaded guilty to a single count of lying to the FBI in a meeting at the White House on Jan. 24 , 2017 that he was led to believe was a friendly chat among colleagues .\nAs for \u201c scot-free , \u201d that better applies to former President Bill Clinton who lied under oath in a civil case and was impeached for perjury but was acquitted by the Senate .\nWe understand why Mr. Obama wouldn \u2019 t bring that up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ read Thursday \u2019 s Justice Department motion to drop the Flynn prosecution .\nIf he does ever read it , he \u2019 ll find disconcerting facts that certainly do raise doubts about whether \u201c our basic understanding of rule of law is at risk , \u201d though not for the reasons he claims .\nStart with prosecutorial violation of the Brady rule , which Mr. Obama knows is a legal obligation that the prosecution must turn over potentially exculpatory evidence to the defense .\nYet prosecutors led by special counsel Robert Mueller didn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ agents at the time didn \u2019 t think that Mr. Flynn had lied about a phone call with the Russian ambassador .\nWorst of all , as a legal matter , is that they never told Mr. Flynn that there was no investigative evidentiary basis to justify the interview .\nThe FBI had already concluded there was no evidence that Mr. Flynn had colluded with Russia in the 2016 election and had moved to close the case .\nJames Comey \u2019 s FBI cronies used the news of Mr. Flynn \u2019 s phone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ excuse to interview the then national security adviser and perhaps trap him into a lie .\nAll of this was moved along politically by leaks to the media about Mr. Flynn \u2019 s phone call with the Russian .\nThe U.S. eavesdrops on foreign officials as a routine , but names of innocent Americans on those calls are supposed to be shielded from review to protect their privacy .\nYet senior Obama officials have had to acknowledge that they \u201c unmasked \u201d Mr. Flynn \u2019 s name and others in their last months @ @ @ @ @ @ @ surprise , news of Mr. Flynn \u2019 s call and its contents pop up in the Washington Post .\nDid someone say \u201c institutional norms \u201d ?\nAll of this raises questions about the role the Obama Justice Department and White House played in targeting Mr. Flynn .\nWe already know the FBI had opened up a counterintelligence probe into Mr. Flynn and other Trump campaign officials , yet it had come up with no evidence of collusion .\nDonald Trump \u2019 s victory increased the chances that this unprecedented spying on a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would have been politically embarrassing at the very least .\nTargeting Mr. Flynn\u2014and flogging the discredited Steele dossier\u2014kept the Russia collusion pot boiling and evolved into the two-year Mueller investigation that turned up no evidence of collusion .\nThis among other things is what U.S. Attorney John Durham is investigating at the request of Attorney General William Barr .\nMaybe that \u2019 s why Mr. Obama is so eager to distort the truth of the Flynn prosecution .\nThe New York Times on U.S. Attorney General William Barr 's decision to drop the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is written by the winners , \u201d William Barr , the attorney general , said Thursday when asked how he thought future generations would assess his decision to drop all criminal charges against Michael Flynn , President Trump \u2019 s former national security adviser , who had pleaded guilty twice to breaking the law .\n\u201c So it largely depends on who \u2019 s writing the history.\n\u201d In service to Mr. Trump , Mr. Barr is abusing his power not to write , but to erase , some of the most important @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scandal , with its revelations of how dangerous a renegade White House could be , led to reforms meant to ensure an independent Justice Department , one faithful to the law rather than to the Oval Office .\nThe nation had seen firsthand how much harm a president with no respect for the rule of law could do \u2014 particularly when he used the Justice Department , under a compliant attorney general , to protect allies , punish adversaries and cover up wrongdoing .\nAmong the key reforms were stronger transparency and ethics @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inspectors general to root out waste , fraud and abuse in the executive branch .\n( Mr. Trump has been firing inspectors general he thinks are not loyal to him . )\nThere were also new limits on presidential power , like the Congressional Budget and Impoundment Control Act .\n( President Trump broke that law last year , according to the nonpartisan Government Accountability Office , when he withheld hundreds of millions of dollars in military aid to Ukraine . )\nTo Mr. Barr , these reforms were obstacles to a vision @ @ @ @ @ @ @ decades , he has pushed to give presidents \u2014 Republican presidents , anyway \u2014 maximum authority with minimal oversight .\nIn a 2018 memo criticizing the Russia investigation , he argued that the president \u201c alone is the Executive branch , \u201d in whom \u201c the Constitution vests all Federal law enforcement power , and hence prosecutorial discretion.\n\u201d For the attorney general , that discretion includes cases involving the president \u2019 s own conduct .\nIf you \u2019 re having trouble distinguishing Mr. Barr \u2019 s vision of the presidency from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ re not alone .\n\u201c George III would have loved it , \u201d said Douglas Kmiec , who led the Justice Department \u2019 s Office of Legal Counsel under Presidents Ronald Reagan and George H.W .\nBush .\n\u201c Bill Barr \u2019 s America is not a place that anyone , including Trump voters , should want to go , \u201d wrote Donald Ayer , who served as deputy attorney general under the first President Bush .\n\u201c It is a banana republic where all are subject to the whims of a dictatorial @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u2019 s America is the one we \u2019 re now living in .\nThe Justice Department , in the midst of a presidential campaign , has become a political weapon .\nHaving absorbed the lessons of Watergate , mainstream Republicans once balked at the politicization of the Justice Department \u2014 even by Republican presidents .\nWhen President George W. Bush \u2019 s attorney general Alberto Gonzales fired eight United States attorneys because they were not aggressive enough in prosecuting Democrats , the outrage was bipartisan , and he was forced to resign .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ could be most effective in defending the integrity of American justice , appear either too afraid of Mr. Trump or too eager for short-term partisan advantage to confront the danger to the country .\nMr. Barr \u2019 s decision to drop the charges against Mr. Flynn may be his most egregious abandonment of his role as the public \u2019 s lawyer , but it \u2019 s certainly not the first .\nLast year , barely a month after he was confirmed to his post , he stood before the American people and misrepresented @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Robert Mueller , the special counsel who investigated ties between the Trump campaign and the Russian government in 2016 .\nThe report itself , at 448 pages , documented extensive evidence of those ties , as well as multiple instances of lying and obstruction of justice by Mr. Trump and other top government officials .\nMr. Barr \u2019 s four-page summary claimed the opposite \u2014 that Mr. Mueller had found no collusion or obstruction of justice .\nMr. Mueller protested , and yet weeks passed before Americans could see the report themselves and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ twisted its findings to benefit Mr. Trump .\nIn March , a federal judge called Mr. Barr \u2019 s characterization of the report \u201c distorted \u201d and \u201c misleading , \u201d and said his \u201c lack of candor \u201d called his credibility into doubt .\nBut Mr. Barr didn \u2019 t stop there .\nHe also rejected a report by the Justice Department inspector general finding that there was sufficient evidence to open the Russia investigation .\nHe referred to the investigation as \u201c spying \u201d and ordered a criminal inquiry into its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of two of Mr. Trump \u2019 s top advisers , Mr. Flynn and Roger Stone , for whom he recommended a lighter sentence than his own prosecutors had sought .\nAnd he declined to open a criminal investigation into last fall \u2019 s whistle-blower complaint against Mr. Trump , saying it did not qualify as an \u201c urgent concern.\n\u201d The complaint ultimately led to Mr. Trump \u2019 s impeachment .\nLast month , Mr. Barr went on Fox News and called the Russia investigation \u201c one of the greatest travesties in American @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We \u2019 re not dealing with just mistakes or sloppiness , there was something far more troubling here ; and we \u2019 re going to get to the bottom of it.\n\u201d With these remarks , Mr. Barr appears to have violated Justice Department policy against publicly discussing current investigations .\nHis insistent attempts to undermine the legitimacy of the Russia investigation and absolve Mr. Trump of any wrongdoing also appear to violate department policy against taking any actions that could be seen to have a partisan political purpose , especially in an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is doing extends beyond policy violations .\nHe has weakened the morale of the department by undercutting career prosecutors \u2014 men and women who devoted their lives to the rule of law .\nFour of them quit the case against Mr. Stone , who was convicted of federal crimes including perjury , wire fraud and witness intimidation , when Mr. Barr intervened to ask for a lighter sentence .\nAnother quit the case against Michael Flynn shortly before the department filed its request with the court to drop all charges .\nPresident Trump @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He has shown little sense of the law , other than that whatever it is , he must be above it .\nHe has never given the slightest hint he thinks the Justice Department exists for a reason other than to protect his interests .\nAnd no wonder , since he took his cues from President Richard Nixon himself .\n\u201c I learned a lot from Richard Nixon , don \u2019 t fire people , \u201d Mr. Trump said on Thursday .\n\u201c I learned a lot .\nI study history.\n\u201d One @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He had tapes all over the place .\nI wasn \u2019 t guilty , I did nothing wrong .\nAnd there are no tapes .\n\u201d", "author":

"content": "WASHINGTON -- President Donald Trump ' has had many targets in his war against the media , but perhaps none is more surprising than the Voice of America , the venerable U.S.-funded institution created during World War II to broadcast independent news and promote American values to the world .\nTrump and his supporters have accused the outlet of \u201c disgraceful \u201d reporting and are now pushing hard to install their choice to run the government agency that oversees VOA and its affiliates .\nThat battle is about to hit Congress , where partisan lines have been drawn amid a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the future of the global broadcaster .\nOver the objections of Democrats , the Senate Foreign Relations Committee plans Thursday to vote on Trump 's nominee to head the U.S. Agency for Global Media , which runs VOA and its sister outlets like Radio Free Asia , Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty and the Cuba-focused Radio Marti .\nThe Republican-controlled committee is expected to advance the nomination .\nDemocrats fear that candidate , conservative filmmaker and former educator Michael Pack , could turn the organization into a Trump propaganda machine funded with more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ taxpayer money .\nTrump has mused about his desire to control a media outlet .\nPack has dismissed concerns he would allow that to happen , but the recent furor has reignited those concerns .\nThe spat has dismayed many who watch the issue closely , including some who believe USAGM and VOA need reform , particularly as changes to the agency \u2019 s governing rules mean its next chief will be able to bypass its board in making personnel and policy decisions .\n\u201c All of this is a distraction from what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what its role should be , \u201d said Tom Kent , a former Associated Press editor who went on to head Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty .\n\u201c It needs to be clear whether VOA \u2019 s role is to advocate for democracy and American values in general or whether it is supposed to be a PR agent for the president and the State Department on current issues.\n\u201d The White House did not respond to inquiries about Pack \u2019 s nomination or the VOA controversy .\nThe Democrats ' stated objections to Pack @ @ @ @ @ @ @ adviser Steve Bannon , center in part on his refusal to answer questions about his previous business dealings .\nYet , the uproar over Voice of America and its recent coverage of China 's handling of the coronavirus pandemic is likely to feature prominently .\nIt has become a touchstone in the Trump administration 's efforts to criticize Chinese authorities for the outbreak and deflect criticism of the U.S. response as the 2020 presidential campaign heats up .\nTrump and his allies have long viewed VOA with suspicion , regarding it as an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trying to thwart their policies .\nBut that hostility burst open on April 9 when Trump communications adviser Dan Scavino posted a VOA story about China to his official Twitter account with the comment \u201c American taxpayers\u2014paying for China \u2019 s very own propaganda , via the U.S. Government funded Voice of America !\nDISGRACE !\n!\n\u201d The story that VOA posted \u2014 about the lifting of the lockdown in the Chinese city of Wuhan , where the new coronavirus first emerged , was actually an Associated Press report \u2014 but the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ publication accused VOA of using taxpayer money \u201c to speak for authoritarian regimes.\n\u201d Trump weighed in several days later , calling VOA 's coverage \u201c disgusting \u201d and demanding that the Senate confirm Pack .\nVOA director Amanda Bennett fired back .\n`` One of the big differences between publicly funded independent media , like the Voice of America , and state-controlled media is that we are free to show all sides of an issue and are actually mandated to do so by law as stated in the VOA Charter , \u201d @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nA representative of the State Department , which holds a seat on the USAGM board , advised the agency to avoid doing anything to endorse Bennett 's response , which it did , according to three people familiar with the matter .\nAnd , an April 14 virtual meeting of the USAGM board came to no conclusion about how , or if , to respond , according to those people who were not authorized to discuss the meeting publicly and spoke on condition of anonymity .\n\u201c All USAGM networks , including @ @ @ @ @ @ @ support of the agency , '' the agency 's current CEO Grant Turner said in an email statement provided to AP .\n`` We have , and will continue to serve the American public by staying true to our mission \u2014 informing , engaging and connecting our audiences in support of freedom and democracy .\nBennett ,

however uncomfortable it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ opportunity for us , \u201d she wrote in the memo , a copy of which was obtained by The AP .\n\u201c Difficult times call for us to be our best selves \u2014 to redouble our commitment to be the ethical , professional journalists that we know we all are.\n\u201d On Wednesday , Turner issued a similar pep talk , lamenting that attacks on journalists have increased and are more dangerous than ever .\n\u201c Personal attacks ... and the subsequent oppressive media environment they create , are just two strategies for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the pandemic , \u201d he said .\nWatching from the wings , former officials who follow the matter are concerned .\nMatt Armstrong , a former Republican appointee to the board of the USAGM 's predecessor , the Broadcasting Board of Governors , said the Trump administration had shown a `` gross misunderstanding the agency \u2019 s mission \u201d in attacking VOA .\nHe also questioned why the administration

\u201d he said .\n\u201c The Trump administration \u2019 s tantrum over VOA is huffing and puffing over something they could have done years ago .\nThis episode further reveals their inability to

Patterson writes , Grant \u2019 s decision to save Pickett , with whom he had served in the Mexican-American war , was a classic act of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ s crimes were set aside , his ineptitude in combat should have ruled him out of consideration when federal authorities were naming military installations .\nBy the time the federal government sought out military training facilities in the South in preparation for war abroad , the school of mythology known as the Lost Cause movement \u2014 forged by groups like The United Daughters of the Confederacy \u2014 had rewritten Civil War history .\nThis telling valorized the Ku Klux Klan ; cast even the most execrable Confederate officers as saints ; and portrayed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who doted on happy black retainers .\nThe Lost Cause era also ushered in a reign of racial terror during which African-Americans were stripped of basic rights and murdered in public for reasons such as competing with whites in business , seeking the vote or even failing to give way on the sidewalk .\nAdolf Hitler himself took notice , praising the United States as the near epitome of the racist state .\nThe Nazi movement normalized its agenda in Germany by pointing out that \u201c racist policies and practices \u201d had been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nThe federal government embraced pillars of the white supremacist movement when it named military bases in the South .\nConsider , for example , Fort Benning , Ga. , which honors a Confederate general , Henry Lewis Benning , who devoted himself to the premise that African-Americans were not really human and could never be trusted with full citizenship .\nBenning was widely influential in Southern politics and served on the Supreme Court of Georgia before turning his attentions to the cause of secession .\nIn a now famous speech in 1861 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that his native state of Georgia had left the union for one reason \u2014 to \u201c prevent the abolition of her slavery.\n\u201d Benning \u2019 s statements strongly resemble that of present-day white supremacists \u2014 and reference the race war theme put forward by the young racist who murdered nine African-Americans in Charleston five years ago .\nBenning warned , for example , that the abolition of slavery would one day lead to the horror of \u201c black governors , black legislatures , black juries , black everything.\n\u201d This , he opined @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mercy of African-Americans with the same rights as white people .\n\u201c We will be completely exterminated , \u201d he said , \u201c and the land will be left in the possession of the blacks , and then it will go back into a wilderness.\n\u201d By naming yet another Georgia base for a Confederate general , John Brown Gordon , the federal government venerated a man who was a leader of the Georgia Ku Klux Klan after the Civil War and who may have taken on a broader role in the terrorist @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a former Confederate general , Nathan Bedford Forrest \u2014 suffered declining health .\nAs a politician , Gordon championed the late-19th-century campaign that stripped African-American Southerners of the citizenship rights they had briefly held during the period just after the Civil War known as Reconstruction .\nAmong the other Confederate officers honored at Southern military bases are merely undistinguished or flatly incompetent commanders like the irascible Gen.

\u201c represent individuals , not causes or ideologies.\n\u201d The first problem with this argument is that , as individuals , these men were traitors .\nThese rebel officers , who were willing to destroy the United States to keep black people in chains , are synonymous with the racist ideology that drove them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the base names were agreed upon as part of broader accommodation in which the military embraced stringent segregation so as not to offend Southerners by treating African-Americans as equals .\nThe names represent not only oppression before and during the Civil War , but also state-sponsored bigotry after it .\nBlack recruits who volunteered to die for their country were mainly shut out of combat units , commanded by white Southerners who often resented being assigned to colored units .\nIn some contexts , black servicemen were treated worse than prisoners of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Horne , for example , flew into a rage during World War II when she arrived at a military camp to entertain only to find that the best seats \u2014 in the \u201c white \u201d section of the audience \u2014 had been reserved for German P.O.W.s .\nThe racist conventions applied on Southern military bases were exported to bases in the North and West as well .\nWhen commanders sought to police the leisure time conduct of black soldiers , those conventions spilled over into surrounding towns that had never known Jim Crow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ II , for example , Southern white officers at a base not far from Philadelphia reacted in vintage Deep South style when they saw black soldiers dating white women .\nOne officer decreed that \u201c any association between the colored soldiers and white women , whether voluntary or not , would be considered rape \u201d \u2014 an offense that had long been subject to the death penalty under military law .\nThe Army surgeon general blew a kiss to racists in 1941 when he justified the Red Cross policy of segregating the wartime @ @ @ @ @ @ @ though there was no scientific reason for doing so .\nThe point was to assure white recipients that they would receive only \u201c white \u201d plasma .\nAfrican-American newspapers quickly pointed out that a black doctor , Dr. Charles Drew , who directed the first Red Cross blood bank , had pioneered the techniques that made large-scale blood plasma storage possible .\nPresident

@ @ @ religion or national origin.\n\u201d Fifteen years later , a young African-American Army officer named Colin Powell marveled at the contrast between the fairness and opportunity he experienced at Fort Benning , Ga. , and the racist treatment he suffered at off-base restaurants that refused to serve him .\nIn his memoir \u201c My American Journey , \u201d Mr. Powell describes the racially

results are from before the coronavirus pandemic upended everything .\nNow , there \u2019 s a chance the outbreak will do what rising anger about income inequality has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ compensation lower .\nHundreds of CEOs across the country have already said they \u2019 ll forgo some or all of their salary .\nAnd the turmoil in the stock market and the global economy could make it tougher for CEOs to meet performance targets and threaten the stock awards and bonuses that make up the majority of their pay .\nBoards of directors could make changes to compensation plans to help shield CEOs from the damage caused by a recession that no one saw coming .\nConsultants and investors say such adjustments are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Executive pay was already under greater scrutiny among those ultimately in charge of how much CEOs get paid : investors who own the company \u2019 s stock and elect the directors to the board .\n\u201c I think there has been a growing sense \u2014 not by all , but a growing portion of institutional investors \u2014 that CEOs are overpaid , \u201d said Amy Borrus , deputy director of the Council of Institutional Investors .\n\u201c It \u2019 s not so much that they \u2019 re overpaid but that it \u2019 s @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She said pay packages are often built on goals set by boards that are difficult for investors to understand and that do n't always incentivize performance .\nThe AP \u2019 s compensation study included pay data for 329 CEOs at S & P 500 companies who have served at least two full fiscal years at their companies , which filed proxy statements between Jan. 1 and April 30 .\nCEOs in the AP \u2019 s survey had a median compensation valued at $ 12.3 million last year , which means half made more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and cash bonuses , that includes stock awards and option grants that CEOs will get the full value of only if the company \u2019 s stock price rises in the future .\nIn many cases , big chunks of the compensation were for stock and options that companies granted their CEOs in 2019 for their performance in 2018 and earlier years .\nThe 4.1 % rise in median pay was a slowdown for S & P 500 CEOs , who had seen their pay jump 7.2 % the year before and by even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the slowdown was because of a drop in how much cash the CEOs got for hitting various performance targets .\nAt Eastman Chemical , for example , the value of CEO Mark Costa \u2019 s compensation dropped 11 % to $ 14 million last year , according to the survey , in part because he fell short in some performance metrics set by the board of directors .\nEastman \u2019 s board said Costa exceeded the goals set for \u201c growth and innovation \u201d in 2019 , but he only partially met the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ generated , as well as for employee safety and other measures .\nHe received $ 377,000 in what the company calls its \u201c unit performance plan , \u201d down from the $ 1.5 million he got from the plan a year earlier .\nThe slowdown in CEO pay across the S & P 500 is partly due to the increased voice investors have gotten on the subject , shareholder advocates say .\nIt \u2019 s been nearly a decade since the U.S. government began requiring companies give their investors a \u201c Say on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them a non-binding up-or-down vote on executive compensation .\nShareholders are giving most companies an overwhelming thumbs up .\nBut the

executive compensation at As You Sow , a shareholder advocacy group .\n\u201c We might find out just how well the system works next year , \u201d she said .\n\u201c I fully expect some companies will keep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and there will be fewer bonuses.\n\u201d Because companies have tied more of their CEOs \u2019 compensation to corporate performance \u2014 and because many boards set their financial goals early this year , before everyone fully appreciated how badly the COVID-19 outbreak would wreck the global economy \u2014 many CEOs are likely to fall short of all the pay they could have been in line for .\nThe S & P 500 lost as much as a third of its value earlier this year , when worries about the recession were at their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ measure for CEO pay , are also expected to crater .\nAcross the S & P 500 , earnings per share will likely sink 33 % this year , strategists at Goldman Sachs say .\nThe economy \u2019 s deep freeze has caused massive layoffs and furloughs , and nearly 39 million U.S. workers have filed for unemployment benefits in the two months since the outbreak took hold in the country .\nIt 's just one of the ways that companies are preserving cash to survive the sudden recession , along with suspending @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) plans and cutting dividend payouts to shareholders .\nTo show that they \u2019 re sharing in the pain , many top executives have volunteered to give up some or all of their salaries .\nAt Disney , which has furloughed 120,000 of its workers , Iger agreed to forgo all his salary through the end of the fiscal year , except for what he \u2019 s contributing to participate in the corporate health benefit plan .\nHe stepped aside as Disney \u2019 s CEO earlier this year and became its executive chairman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Comcast \u2019 s Brian Roberts , pledged to donate all his salary to charities that support COVID-19 relief efforts \u201c for the duration of this situation.\n\u201d A CEO \u2019 s salary , though , typically makes up less than 10 % of total compensation each year .\nWhat will hit CEOs \u2019 pocketbooks more is what happens to companies \u2019 share prices , which will affect the value of stock and options they were already granted , as well as the bonuses they would have been in line for .\n`` @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some significant decrease in outstanding value for executives , \u201d said Kelly Malafis , partner at Compensation Advisory Partners .\nThe economy \u2019 s sudden , unexpected downdraft has investors on guard for boards of directors to rejigger CEOs \u2019 performance goals and make them easier to achieve .\nBoards could also give CEOs bigger grants of stock to make up for the plunges in price earlier this year , as many companies did after the 2008 financial crisis .\n\u201d The risk is that if there is a strong rebound in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ profits for executives , \u201d said Borrus of the Council of Institutional Investors , which represents pension funds and other big investors .\nSome boards are already discussing whether they should make changes to compensation , consultants say .\nBut most are in a wait-and-see mode given all the uncertainty about where the economy is heading , and given how much scrutiny is sure to be cast on pay packages next year .\nBesides , the stock market has already recovered more than half its earlier losses .\n\u201d

& Electric 's $ 58 billion plan for getting out of a bankruptcy caused by a series of deadly wildfires , despite ongoing worries about the utility 's ability to safely operate its crumbling electrical grid .\nThe vote by the Public Utilities Commission came just a few hours after a federal judge ripped the company for continuing to engage in reckless behavior that he believes is endangering even more lives .\nU.S. District Judge William Alsup blasted PG & E for \u201c flim flamming \u201d him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ previous hearings .\nHe also raised worries that state power regulators haven \u2019 t done enough to prevent \u201c a recalcitrant criminal \u201d from causing more death and destruction as the risk of wildfires rises with the summer temperatures .\n\u201c If there ever was a corporation that deserved to go to prison , it is PG & E , \u201d Alsup said .\nAfter enduring Alsup 's scorn , PG & E cleared a key hurdle to end its nearly year-and-half bankruptcy with the PUC 's approval of a complex plan resolving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ losses after the company was blamed for igniting a series of catastrophic wildfires in 2017 and 2018 .\nThe Northern California fires killed more than 100 people and destroyed more than 27,000 homes and other buildings .\nPG & E used the bankruptcy process to settle those claims for $ 25.5 billion , including $ 13.5 billion earmarked for wildfire victims , although some survivors are convinced they will wind up getting much less .\nHalf of the $ 13.5 billion consists of PG & E stock that critics worry will be worth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is blamed for causing more fires this year .\nBefore regulators voted , a litany of speakers urged the company 's chief regulator to reject the complex proposal , saying it does n't do enough to ensure the nation 's largest utility will act to protect the 16 million people who rely on it for power .\n\u201c More communities are angry , frustrated and finished with PG & E , '' commission President Marybel Batjer acknowledged before the agency 's vote .\nAfter the approval , PG & E issued a statement @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bill Johnson said the plan \u201c will help PG & E become the utility that our customers and communities expect and deserve . ''\nAlsup , the federal judge , wants to crack down on PG & E by ordering the utility to hire more people to inspect its power lines , trim trees and adhere to other potentially expensive requirements aimed at reducing the fire risks from its poorly maintained equipment .\nThe company is appealing his proposed restriction on the grounds that those policing powers should be left to the Public @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mandate as part of a five-year probation that PG & E began serving in January 2017 for felony convictions stemming from an explosion in its natural gas lines that killed eight people in San Bruno , California , in 2010 .\nIf it were up to Alsup , PG & E would be serving time behind bars instead of providing power to a service territory with a population larger than all but a handful of states .\nCompanies ca n't be imprisoned , though , an issue likely to be highlighted again next @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plead guilty to 84 felony counts of involuntary manslaughter for a 2018 wildfire that wiped out the town of Paradise , California .\nPG & E will pay a maximum fine of $ 4 million for those crimes .\nIn Thursday 's hearing , Alsup repeatedly expressed frustrations about the company 's past assurances that it had become more vigilant about trimming trees and upgrading its equipment , only to ignite more fires .\nThose promises \u201c ring hollow after awhile , '' Alsup scolded PG & E 's lawyers before labeling past @ @ @ @ @ @ @ power lines as \u201c crappy . ''\nWhile Alsup was raising the idea of more safety hearings , one of PG & E 's top executives delivered reassurances about the company 's future direction during Thursday 's hearing in a federal bankruptcy court trial , which will determine whether PG & E \u2019 s plan also can gain the required court approval by a June 30 deadline .\nChristine Hammond , an attorney for the PUC , told Alsup that state regulators believe PG & E has been making significant progress toward operating @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to \u201c do more , do better , do faster . ''\nMichael Aguirre , a lawyer representing two PG & E customers , urged Alsup not to trust the commission or the company that it regulates .\n\u201c Keep the pressure on , \u201d he pleaded .\nThe plan approved by regulators clears a path for them to revoke PG & E 's state license and make it easier for the state to turn the utility into a not-for-profit cooperative .\nIt also requires PG & E to break up its sprawling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ board of directors .\nThe company plans to replace 11 of its 14 current board members , including Johnson , who will step down as CEO on June 30 after only 14 months on the job .\nBut the reforms included in PG & E 's plan still might not be enough , acknowledged Clifford Rechtschaffen , one of the the five PUC board members .\n\u201c It 's not perfect from any stakeholder 's perspective , '' he said before voting in favor of the plan .", "author": "", "url": "https://abcnews.go.com/US/wireStory/judge-rips-pges-safety-record-key-bankruptcy-vote-70938606", "published": "Thu, 28 May 2020 19:09:48 -0400", "published_utc": 1590707388, "collection_utc": 1590712225}, {"id": "abcnews--2020-05-29--Twitter adds 'glorifying violence' warning to Trump tweet", "date": "2020-05-29", "source": "abcnews", "title": "Twitter adds 'glorifying violence' warning to Trump tweet", "content": "WASHINGTON -- Twitter has added a warning to one of President Donald Trump 's tweets about protests in Minneapolis , saying it violated the platform 's rules about \u201c glorifying violence .

in 2022 , saying in a Thursday ruling that the ballot summary is deceptive because it does n't clearly state that a grandfathering clause applies to the owner , not the gun itself .\nA group called Ban Assault Weapons Now sponsored the proposed constitutional amendment , inspired by the mass shooting at a Parkland high school that left 17 people dead .\nIt would have banned the possession of any

the Florida Department of Law Enforcement .\nBut the court in a 4-1 opinion said the ballot summary was misleading because it said weapons lawfully possessed before the initiative was passed would be

legally owned a weapon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or give it to someone else .\n\u201c While the ballot summary purports to exempt registered assault weapons lawfully possessed prior to the Initiative \u2019 s

Consequently , the Initiative should be placed on the ballot.\n\u201d If the language was approved and group had gathered enough petitions to place it on the ballot , it would have needed 60 % voter approval to pass , The ruling prompted a strong reaction from Ban Assault Weapons now .\nThe group is chaired by Gail Schwartz , whose 14-year-old nephew Alex @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Marjory Stoneman Douglas

who will only approve initiatives they agree with politically.\n\u201d The state had certified about 175,000 of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to place the proposal on the ballot .\nBut since the petitions used the language the court says is invalid , the group can \u2019 t simply tweak the ballot summary .\nIt would have to start over .\nAttorney General Ashley Moody opposed the ballot initiative , as did the

civil rights , equal justice and common sense , the Supreme Court ruled on Monday that federal law bars employers from firing workers for being lesbian , gay , bisexual or transgender .\nThe vote was 6 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unanimous .\nAs Justice Neil Gorsuch explained for the court \u2019 s majority , the right result could not be clearer .\nThe federal law at issue , Title VII of the 1964 Civil Rights Act , prohibits employment discrimination \u201c because of sex.\n\u201d And \u201c an employer who fires an individual for being homosexual or transgender fires that person for traits or actions it would not have questioned in members of a different sex , \u201d Justice Gorsuch wrote .\n\u201c Sex plays a necessary and undisguisable role in the decision @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In separate cases consolidated for argument , three plaintiffs \u2014 two gay men and a transgender woman \u2014 had sued their employers for firing them after learning of their sexual orientation or transgender status .\nIt does not matter , the court said , whether the employer might have had additional reasons for the firing .\n\u201c Intentionally burning down a neighbor \u2019 s house is arson , even if the perpetrator \u2019 s ultimate intention ( or motivation ) is only to improve the view , \u201d Justice Gorsuch wrote .\nNor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ s prohibition by claiming it treats all men the same or all women the same .\nThe bottom line , he wrote , is that Congress wrote a law with intentionally broad language , and \u201c ours is a society of written laws.\n\u201d Monday \u2019 s decision will soon have ripple effects , including the likely invalidation of the Trump administration \u2019 s decision last week to eliminate protections against discrimination in health care for transgender patients .\nIn a lengthy dissent that sounded like it was written in 1964 , Justice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Thomas , argued that the court \u2019 s job is to interpret statutes to \u201c mean what they conveyed to reasonable people at the time they were written.\n\u201d It \u2019 s hard to imagine these justices applying the same logic to the meaning of the Second Amendment , which reasonable people at the time understood to apply to bayonets and muskets .\nBut we digress .\nJustice Alito \u2019 s point was that the lawmakers who passed the Civil Rights Act could not possibly have anticipated \u201c sex \u201d to cover discrimination @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gender identity .\nThat \u2019 s true , of course .\nThey also could not have imagined that it would cover sexual harassment of male employees \u2014 and yet in 1998 the Supreme Court found unanimously that it did .\n\u201c Statutory prohibitions often go beyond the principal evil to cover reasonably comparable evils , and it is ultimately the provisions of our laws rather than the principal concerns of our legislators by which we are governed , \u201d the court said then , in an opinion written by Justice Antonin Scalia .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the bench , reiterated this basic concept on Monday : \u201c The limits of the drafters \u2019 imagination supply no reason to ignore the law \u2019 s demands .\nWhen the express terms of a statute give us one answer and extratextual considerations suggest another , it \u2019 s no contest .\nOnly the written word is the law , and all persons are entitled to its benefit.\n\u201d While we \u2019 re on the subject of legislators \u2019 intentions , it is worth noting the historical irony behind the inclusion of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ law \u2014 which was , after all , targeted primarily at racial discrimination .\nThe term was added at the last minute by Representative Howard Smith , a staunch segregationist from Virginia , in the hope that lawmakers would see it as a bridge too far and vote down the entire bill .\nMr. Smith \u2019 s failed gambit continues to pay off in ways that he surely never could have dreamed .\nStill , there are reasons to be cautious .\nJustice Gorsuch \u2019 s commitment to textualism , a method of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plain words , achieved a just result in this case , but when applied too rigidly it can lead to very unjust results .\nIn his previous job on a

Seoul", "content": "SEOUL , South Korea -- North Korea on Tuesday said it has no immediate intent to resume a dialogue with the United States as U.S. Deputy Secretary of State Stephen Biegun arrived in South Korea for discussions on stalled nuclear diplomacy .\nIn a statement released through the North 's official Korean Central News Agency , senior North Korean foreign ministry official Kwon Jong Gun also ridiculed \u201c nonsensical \u201d calls by South Korea for revived negotiations between the U.S. and North Korea , saying it has lost its relevance as a mediator .\nThe State Department said Biegun , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ s special representative for North Korea , will discuss cooperation on a range of issues in meetings this week with officials in South Korea and Japan , including the \u201c final , fully verified denuclearization \u201d of North Korea .\nKwon 's statement came hours before Biegun arrived at a U.S. air base near Seoul .\nThe U.S. Embassy said Biegun , members of his delegation and the military air crew were being tested for COVID-19 at the base and would proceed to Seoul after confirmation that all had negative test results .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ Un have met three times since embarking on high-stakes nuclear diplomacy in 2018 .\nBut negotiations have faltered since their second summit in February last year in Vietnam , where the Americans rejected North Korean demands for major sanctions relief in exchange for a partial surrender of its nuclear capability .\nAmid the stalemate in talks , North Korea has repeatedly said in recent months that it would no longer give Trump the gift of high-profile meetings he could boast of as foreign policy achievements unless it gets something substantial in return .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ pressure on the South , cutting off virtually all cooperation and blowing up an inter-Korean liaison office in its territory last month , following months of frustration over Seoul \u2019 s unwillingness to defy U.S.-led sanctions and restart joint economic projects that would help the North 's broken economy .\n\u201c Explicitly speaking once again , we have no intention to sit face-to-face with U.S. , \u201d Kwon said in the statement .\nSome analysts believe North Korea will avoid serious talks with the Americans for now and instead focus on pressuring the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bargaining power before an eventual return to negotiations after the U.S. presidential election in November .\nThey say North Korea likely doesn \u2019 t want to make any major commitments or concessions when there is a chance U.S. leadership could change .\nBut Leif-Eric Easley , a professor at Ewha University in Seoul , said the prospects of a fourth Trump-Kim meeting shouldn \u2019 t be ruled out .\n\u201c Normally a U.S. president wouldn \u2019 t take such a gambit ahead of an election , but down in the polls , Trump @ @ @ @ @ @ @ script , \u201d he said .\nKim may also see a closing window of opportunity if Trump is expected to leave office and could possibly attempt to exchange reversible denuclearization steps for sanctions relief and South Korean investment , Easley said .\nKwon \u2019 s statement came days after North Korean First Vice Foreign Minister Choe Sun Hui , whom Biegun has described as his potential counterpart when talks resume , insisted the North wo n't resume negotiations unless Washington discards what it describes as \u201c hostile \u201d policies .\nShe criticized the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ North as \u201c nothing more than a tool for grappling its political crisis.\n\u201d Without naming him outright , Kwon also took a jab at Moon , who in a video conference with European leaders last week expressed hope that Trump and Kim would meet again before the U.S. elections .\n\u201c ( Choe \u2019

Democratic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u201c We feel sorry to see ( the South ) trying so hard to become the \u2018 mediator \u2019 but it may try as much as it wants if it cherishes so strong wish to try it to the end .\nTime will show whether its efforts will succeed or it will only suffer a loss and ridicule.\n\u201d Biegun is to meet with South Korean Foreign Minister Kang Kyung-wha and other South Korean officials on Wednesday before leaving for Japan on Thursday , Kang 's ministry said .", "author": "", "url":

, \u201d days after the negotiator said Pyongyang wo n't resume talks with Washington because of its \u201c hostile \u201d policies .\nThe comments by Deputy Secretary of State Stephen Biegun were a

Washington may not be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\n\u201c I \u2019 ve seen some recent press reporting that the North Koreans are not prepared to meet with me on this visit , \u201d Biegun told reporters after talks with South Korean officials .\n\u201c We did not request a meeting with the North Koreans .\nThis visit is to meet with our close friends and allies , the Republic of Korea , and we had an excellent discussion.\n\u201d Biegun was likely referring to recent North Korean state media reports that cited Vice Foreign Minister Choe Sun Hui as saying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unless Washington discards what she described as \u201c hostile \u201d policies .\nChoe , who has been deeply involved in the nuclear talks , also slammed the U.S. for its \u201c shallow tactic \u201d to use North Korea for domestic political gains .\n\u201c I also want to be very clear on one point .\nI do not take my direction from ( Choe ) , nor from Ambassador John Bolton , \u201d Biegun said .\nAlong with Choe , Biegun was referring to President Donald Trump \u2019 s former national security adviser @ @ @ @ @ @ @ accused him of pursuing an \u201c unhealthy negotiation path \u201d by demonstrating a willingness to negotiate a step-by-step deal advocated by North Korea .\n\u201c Both are locked in an old way of thinking , focused on only the negatives and what is impossible , rather than thinking

almost identical to the written statement .\nIt wasn \u2019 t immediately @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not include that comment .\nSouth Korean media speculated that Biegun may have been trying not to provoke North Korea too much , though he could have simply accidentally missed those parts .\nIn both his verbal and written remarks , Biegun , who has previously described Choe as his potential counterpart when talks resume , said the U.S. would be ready for talks with North Korea when his dialogue interlocutor is named , in his apparent disapproval of Choe as his counterpart .\n\u201c When Chairman Kim appoints a counterpart to me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on these issues , they will find us ready at that very moment , \u201d Biegun said , referring to North Korean leader Kim Jong Un .\nNorth Korea \u2019 s state news agency on Wednesday didn \u2019 t issue any fresh statements on the United States .\nEarlier in the day , it reported that Kim had visited a mausoleum in Pyongyang to pay tribute to his late grandfather and state founder Kim Il Sung on the 26th anniversary of his death .\nTrump and Kim have met three times since 2018 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ apart since their second summit in February last year in Vietnam .\nNorth Korea has repeatedly said in recent months that it would no longer give Trump the gift of high-profile meetings he could boast of as foreign policy achievements unless it gets something substantial in return .\nNorth Korea recently dialed up pressure on South Korea by cutting off virtually all cooperation and blowing up an inter-Korean liaison office in its territory last month .\nThat followed months of frustration over Seoul \u2019 s unwillingness to defy U.S.-led sanctions and restart joint @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u2019 s broken economy .\nSome analysts believe North Korea will also avoid serious talks with the Americans for now and instead focus on pressuring the South in a bid to increase its bargaining power before an eventual return to negotiations after the U.S. presidential election in November .\nThey say North Korea likely doesn \u2019 t want to make any major commitments or concessions when there is a chance that U.S. leadership could change .", "author":

we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back off and let us do this.\n\u201d What to do with the site has been a source of contention since the home was heavily damaged in a magnitude 9.2 earthquake in 1964 , the second most powerful ever recorded .\nOne of the three main buildings was damaged and demolished after the quake .\nThe boarding school was eventually moved to Anchorage , and the Seward site has sat unused since .\nCity officials said the home has deteriorated more in the last decade between engineering studies , but Neal offered another @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that concluded while there has been deterioration in the last seven years , \u201c restoration is a viable option , \u201d but must be done quickly .\nAttempts by individuals and a group over the years to refurbish the home have sputtered and stalled .\nSeward Mayor Christy Terry said when the Friends of the Jesse Lee Home lost a multimillion-dollar state grant a few years ago , ownership reverted to the city .\nThe Legislature allocated $ 1 million of that to the city .\n\u201c We do not have the capacity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a building that \u2019 s so degraded because of the inaction , frankly , of a group that was their very last chance to make that happen , that the state funded incredibly well , \u201d Terry said .\n\u201c Something like that is never going to happen again.\n\u201d She said there is no rush to demolish the site but the council has a June 30 , 2021 , deadline to use state funding .\n\u201c For them to blame us for where we are now , they are sorely mistaken , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ want to come in at the 13th hour .\nNo one has a check .\nNo one has any ideas about how that property can be operated or what to do with it.\n\u201d If the council approves the demolition measure , the city would use the state money to remove hazardous materials like asbestos , demolish the remaining two buildings and haul the material away .\nThe proposal also calls for building a memorial at the site .\nThat design would involve community input , Terry said , adding she has her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ include .\nShe would like to salvage any usable beams and incorporate them into a pavilion that would include storyboards spelling out the home \u2019 s place in Alaska history .\nThe pavilion could be rented out , she said .\nTerry would also like to include a new playground at the site and close another nearby playground , turning that lot into single-family housing .\nIf the council doesn \u2019 t vote for demolition , they will then later consider other options , including one that would begin refurbishing the buildings .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Jesse Lee Home was an important institution in state history , noting that the Army used the buildings during World War II and even camouflaged them using paint to protect them from the enemy .\n\u201c It \u2019 s just sort of disappointing that the city and the residents have never embraced trying to fix up the buildings that remain and find a good use for them , \u201d she said

tweeted last Wednesday , after several high-profile accounts on his site were hacked .\nThis was an understatement .\nThe security breach the social media network experienced last week was alarming not only for what happened but also for what could have happened .\nAccounts from Warren Buffett to Kanye West to Joe Biden promised to double money sent to a Bitcoin address .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ community due to covid-19 !\n\u201d former president Barack Obama , another victim , appeared to declare .\nThe perpetrator made off with about $ 118,000 .\nBut imagine trusted accounts hijacked to share false news of a massive terror attack and unleash financial meltdown \u2014 or imagine them taken over on Election Day to give voters false information about polling places .\nThese worse-case scenarios point to the risks when public and even government figures carry out essential functions on a single private platform .\nThe mishap should teach elected officials not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or anything else to communicate with constituents .\nBut it should also teach platforms to adopt smarter cybersecurity practices .\nTwitter hasn \u2019 t yet provided a full post-mortem , but a blog post from the company combined with reporting from multiple outlets offers a peek : A hacker lurking on a forum generally used for stealing and then selling credentials to accounts with coveted short-character screen names ( often an individual letter or number such as @ 6 or @ y ) boasted that he had access to Twitter \u2019 s internal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ social engineering \u201d \u2014 which could mean phishing of employees or bribery or even an insider-initiated attack .\nOnce he had done so , he could bypass all the safeguards people are always being told are essential to responsible security .\nOf course , these safeguards are still essential .\nBut companies such as Twitter must also take steps to ensure the integrity of their platforms , primarily when it comes to administrative tools employees use to touch the most sensitive information .\nSites should require more sources of authentication for getting into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u2019 t be enough .\nThey should also scale back the number of workers who can use the systems , and institute robust monitoring programs that alert them when something suspicious is happening behind the scenes .\nAnd they ought to

remember that the struggle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that it will not come cheaply nor easily , that the path can be dangerous and the pain very real , and that it will almost certainly never be over .\nWe can remember too , though , that it can be rewarded \u2014 that things can get better \u2014 and that Lewis \u2019 sacrifice , along with those of the Freedom Riders and so many advocates for reform , bequeathed to us a better nation , where we more fully , if still imperfectly , embrace the individual dignity of each @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of their basic human rights .\nLewis , who died at 80 Friday , had his skull cracked with a billy club as a young man to help bring us to this place where we are .\nAnd even as violence was done upon him , he rejected violence in return .\nThe undeniable moral authority that he carried on the Edmund Pettus Bridge in Selma , Ala. , in 1965 was the authority that finally mattered .\nIn considering his legacy , we must also consider the work that remains .\nPoverty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and codified racism still track our country .\nLewis supported the marches in opposition of police violence against Black Americans and considered them an extension of his work as a young man .\nWe also hope , as we memorialize his life and all he did as a protester , organizer and congressman , that we don \u2019 t fail to recognize the truth that his work mattered because it made a real difference in our country and in improving the lives of Black Americans .\nThe America that John Lewis died in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ born into as the child of sharecroppers .\nIt is not the same America that disenfranchised Black Americans as a matter of law denied them basic human rights .\nIt is an America that took his search for justice and equality seriously , that cared his body was beaten and his skull fractured , that rejected the forces of inequality , segregation and racism .\nThat better America is an America we must work toward every day .\nThe struggle is renewed over and over in each of us as individuals and in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ John Lewis has died .\nBut in a good and ever better America , John Lewis will live forever .\nThe Wall Street Journal on charges brought against a Missouri couple for displaying guns at protesters during a demonstration outside their mansion : By now all America knows Mark and Patricia McCloskey from the video showing the St. Louis couple holding legal firearms as they defended themselves and their home from a crowd of protesters trespassing on their property .\nA politically motivated prosecutor on Monday charged the couple with unlawful use of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because they pointed their weapons at protesters .\nMr. McCloskey said he did so because he was \u201c scared for my life , \u201d and that of his wife .\nNo shots were fired .\nYet now prosecutor Kim Gardner is charging them on grounds they made the trespassers fear for their safety .\nThe good news is that there \u2019 s been plenty of official blowback .\nMissouri Gov .\nMike Parson tweeted that \u201c We will not allow law-abiding citizens to be targeted for exercising their constitutional rights.\n\u201d He has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ convicted .\nAttorney General Eric Schmitt is working to get the case dismissed , noting that , in addition to the U.S. and Missouri constitutions , Missouri law recognizes the \u201c castle doctrine.\n\u201d This allows residents to use force against intruders , including deadly force , based on self-defense and the notion that your home is your castle .\nMs. Gardner contends that those who surrounded the McCloskeys were \u201c peaceful , unarmed protesters , \u201d and the couple were therefore interfering in the crowd \u2019 s First Amendment rights .\nIt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Ms. Gardner that the guns they carried may be a reason events didn \u2019 t turn violent .\n\u201c I really thought it was Storming the Bastille , that we would be dead and the house would be burned and there was nothing we could do about it , \u201d Mr. McCloskey told KSDK in an interview .\nEven if the charges are dismissed , or the McCloskeys are pardoned after being convicted , again we have a public official responsible for upholding law and order wink at a mob while treating @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can not be counted on to deal with mobs , it \u2019 s even more vital that law-abiding Americans are free to exercise their Second Amendment right to protect themselves .\nThe Los Angeles Times on President Donald Trump sending federal law enforcement officers to Portland , Oregon : The deployment of federal agents in Portland , Ore. , over the objection of state and local officials , to shoot and gas protesters and to snatch people from the street to stuff them into unmarked vans is an unconscionable assault on democracy and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tension .\nPresident Trump \u2019 s action in defiance of Oregon \u2019 s governor and Portland \u2019 s mayor has predictably given new life to nonstop protests that began after the May 25 death of George Floyd in Minneapolis police custody but at last had begun to peter out .\nThe president has thus employed his wretched talent for exacerbating division and inflaming discord at precisely the time the nation needs a leader to calm overheated passions and fears .\nPresidents have broad power to deploy troops to quell lawlessness , but they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ request assistance , or when the commander-in-chief himself determines that state authorities are failing to deal with the problem .\nThey send in federal forces to protect people or to enforce the Constitution , as when President Eisenhower sent troops to Little Rock , Ark.\n, in 1957 to enforce the right of Black students to enroll in a previously all-white high school and to make clear that the famous Supreme Court ruling in Brown vs. Board of Education would be enforced , that the doctrine of \u201c separate but equal \u201d had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could not defy the basic American principle that all people are equal under law .\nTrump , by contrast , directed federal agencies to use their muscle to protect statues , monuments and other federal properties , not people or the Constitution .\nAnd he said Monday that he plans to do this in more cities \u2014 evidently , because he thinks displaying force against the citizenry is going to help him in November .\nThis has become part of his pattern .\nIn the weeks before overreacting to the Portland protests , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for a photo op near the White House .\nHe set forth his doctrine that \u201c when the looting starts , the shooting starts.\n\u201d He articulated his principle that states should \u201c dominate the streets , \u201d and if they didn \u2019 t , that he would override their authority .\nIt is a fact that some individuals have used the protests in Portland as an opportunity to destroy property and inject chaos into the demonstrations .\nIt fell to Portland leaders to strike the proper balance .\nThey could respond with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u2019 hands by presenting police engaged in precisely the kind of actions that were being protested ; or they could monitor the situation , give protesters the room to make their case , tolerate some property losses and allow the demonstrations to die down on their own .\nThey made their choices , and they may well have made some bad ones .\nPortland has been on edge for weeks .\nBut Mayor Ted Wheeler is the person answerable to the city \u2019 s people .\nHe did not need , and did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u2019 s insistence on federalizing the situation on his own undermines Portlanders \u2019 control of their own city , and exacerbates the violence far more than the protesters \u2019 actions did .\nThe president has in effect equated people protesting police brutality with terrorists , and is treating them as such .\nIn October , before Trump \u2019 s impeachment , before the COVID-19 pandemic , before the death of Floyd and before the nationwide protests , the president signed an order creating a Commission on Law Enforcement and the Administration of Justice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ takes , this one appeared to be geared directly toward undoing an action of the Obama administration , in this case the creation of the 2015 President \u2019 s Task Force on 21st Century Policing .\nThe Obama task force delved into police brutality , racial disparities in arrests and prosecutions , and other challenges facing modern-day policing in the U.S. Its recommendations included enhancing civilian oversight , improving training and building trust and legitimacy .\nMany of its efforts were rolled back by the Trump administration .\nIn launching Trump \u2019 s @ @ @ @ @ @ @ included as a central question something that apparently baffles him as well as the president : Why is there a \u201c continued lack of trust and respect for law enforcement \u201d in many communities ?\nThe answer is right under their noses .\nIt is spread out on the street with George Floyd , it is shoved alongside protesters into unmarked federal police vans , it stands agog , with many of us , at actions to protect statues but shoot projectiles at people .\nThe president won \u2019 t look .\nHe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that won \u2019 t open .\nThe South China Morning Post on tensions between the United States and China : The risk of military conflict in the South China Sea between China and the United States is high and tensions are rising .\nIn the midst of the Covid-19 crisis , amid discord on a wide range of issues and shortly after both held naval exercises in the area at the same time , American Secretary of State Mike Pompeo has raised the stakes to even more worrying levels by ending his country @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the contested waters .\nHis siding with Southeast Asian nations over Beijing was to be expected , as was the foreign ministry \u2019 s angry response , but weighing in on so sensitive a row is a further unnecessary provocation that puts the rivals and their allies on a dangerous course .\nWith relations arguably at their worst and seemingly spiraling out of control , there is every need for a diplomatic solution , no matter how remote that may appear .\nBeijing has wasted no time in assuring Southeast Asian countries , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Singapore and Thailand and Foreign Minister Wang Yi contacting his Philippine counterpart .\nWashington \u2019 s refraining from commenting on the South China Sea issue had made a peaceful agreement between China and its neighbors on the various sovereignty claims more possible .\nIncreasingly frequent sailings of US warships through the contested waters were voiced in terms of ensuring freedom of navigation in the busy shipping lanes .\nBut Pompeo discarded the US \u2019 position last week , describing Beijing \u2019 s claims to parts of the resource-rich seas as \u201c completely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time with a 2016 tribunal ruling by the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea , which has not been acceded to by the US .\nNeither side is blameless , but US President Donald Trump \u2019 s administration has taken an increasingly antagonistic approach towards China on a widening range of issues .\nIt has blamed Beijing for the coronavirus pandemic , an unproven claim that is in the way of cooperation to develop a vaccine .\nThe Sino-US relationship is among the most important in the world and talks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ last month between China \u2019 s top diplomat , Yang Jiechi , and Pompeo , was an opportunity to explain positions and visualise limits .\nWang recently laid out a strategy in which he proposed Chinese and American think tanks draw up three lists detailing areas of cooperation and discord so that disputes could be managed and their impact on relations minimised .\nRestraint is a sensible course and also a form of diplomacy .\nPursuing the alternative makes no sense when the world \u2019 s most pressing agenda should be fighting the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and livelihoods .\nDialogue , not confrontation , is urgently needed to avoid crossing red lines .\nThe New York Times on expanding internet access for Americans amid the coronavirus pandemic : When Autumn Lee , a pre-med junior at the University of New Mexico , needs to download lectures or class assignments , she hops in her car and drives 45 minutes to the McDonald \u2019 s nearest to her town of Sanders , Ariz. , to connect to reliable Wi-Fi from her car .\nAfter the university sent students home because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grew frustrated with what she said is expensive and data-restricted internet service in Sanders , an unincorporated village of fewer than 1,000 people in eastern Arizona .\nRelying on her smartphone data plan wasn \u2019 t much of an alternative .\n\u201c It took one or two hours to watch a 20-minute lecture , \u201d she said .\n\u201c I just got so frustrated , I figured there had to be another way.\n\u201d So she made the 40-mile trek several times each week \u2014 and she \u2019 ll likely have to keep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ canceled nearly all in-person classes for the fall .\nLike Ms. Lee , many other Americans sheltering from Covid-19 are discovering the limitations of the country \u2019 s cobbled-together broadband service .\nSchooling , jobs , government services , medical care and child care that once were performed in person have been turned over to the web , exposing a deep rift between the broadband haves and have-nots .\nThose rifts are poised to turn into chasms , as the global pandemic threatens another year of in-person schooling for American children .\nLarge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ George \u2019 s County in Maryland , as well as a variety of colleges and universities , from Hampton to Harvard to Scripps , have canceled in-school instruction at the start of the coming year .\nGov .\nGavin Newsom on Friday announced rules that would require the vast majority of schools in California to begin the year remotely , meaning millions of pupils will need a reliable internet connection throughout the day for instruction .\nAdditional districts that are going online only at the start of the year include Nashville , Houston @ @ @ @ @ @ @ follow , as the raging contagion in their communities gives them little alternative .\nAn adequate connection is no longer a matter of convenience ; it is a necessity for anyone wishing to participate in civil society .\nService is often unavailable or too expensive in rural communities and low-income neighborhoods .\nThis has forced people into parking lots outside libraries , schools and coffee shops to find a reliable signal \u2014 while others are simply staying logged off .\nAt the same time , there is pressure on small businesses that are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or face extinction .\nYet , federal and local initiatives have failed to bring swift internet service to tens of millions of Americans .\nLike electricity , internet service has become a necessity for modern life .\n\u201c What Covid-19 has done is accelerate the pace of technological change , \u201d said Kathryn de Wit , manager of the Pew Charitable Trust \u2019 s broadband research initiative .\n\u201c Getting online isn \u2019 t an option anymore , and if you don \u2019 t have that connection , you \u2019 re pretty much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inequity extend back at least as far as 2009 , when Congress directed the Federal Communications Commission to develop a plan to get broadband service to nearly every American .\nSome 21 million still lack it , according to commissioners \u2019 estimates .\nYet that might be an underestimate : One study puts it far higher , at around 42 million .\nThe Pew Research Center said as many as one in four rural Americans lack high-speed internet service , because of either the cost or a lack of availability .\nMicrosoft and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ data , which relies on self-reporting from internet service providers \u2014 reporting that can indicate an entire census block has service even if service is provided to just one household within the area .\nGetting an accurate count of where broadband is needed is critical , because it helps federal programs like the Rural Digital Opportunity Fund determine where to spend to expand broadband \u2019 s reach , meaning the Opportunity Fund \u2019 s $ 20.4 billion in planned outlays over the next 10 years could still leave many Americans behind .\nTwo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dissented over parts of the funding , citing the faulty accounting .\nTwo bills passed by the House last year would help improve how broadband \u2019 s reach is counted .\nThese bills are encouraging bipartisan steps toward addressing the problem .\nAlso worthy of strong consideration is a bill introduced last month by Representative James Clyburn , Democrat of South Carolina .\nIt was followed by a Senate version this month , that would devote $ 100 billion toward making broadband accessible in underserved areas .\nBut Republicans have indicated that they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In urban areas , the struggle to get reliable or affordable internet service disproportionately affects minorities .\nThe cost of broadband makes it three times more likely that households without internet service can be found in urban , rather than rural , environments , according to John B. Horrigan of the Technology Policy Institute .\nDistance learning over Zoom may be a poor substitute for the real thing , but with school closings amid the coronavirus extending into the fall , students without home internet connections could slip further behind .\nTo help @ @ @ @ @ @ @ distributed Wi-Fi hot spots and laptops to needy students .\nFrancine Hernandez drove to a Tucson , Ariz. parking lot with her 14-year-old daughter every day for nearly a month to access Wi-Fi beamed from yellow district school buses .\nShe said the family had lost service after her husband lost his job , making this the best alternative .\n\u201c It was the only way she could finish her homework , \u201d said Ms. Hernandez .\nShe said she sat in the car with her daughter for three hours at a stretch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Today , broadband is a patchwork of infrastructure and services offered primarily by major corporations like Verizon and AT & T .\nBut swaths of the country have been left with no service , either because of a lack of perceived profits or a lack of the political will to extend fiber to harder-to-reach communities .\nElectrifying the entire country a century ago was made possible by a coordinated federal plan from the administration of Franklin D. Roosevelt The Rural Electrification Administration brought electricity to areas outside city centers through federal loans to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and generators to their communities .\nWhile such a centralized effort may be unlikely today without the urgency of the New Deal , the coronavirus has demonstrated that it is time for the federal government to think more creatively and to act more swiftly to deploy broadband service .\nAs service areas exist today , Geoff Wiggins can not get broadband internet service extended to his house in Liberty Township , Ohio , near Columbus , even though he lives just a few houses in either direction from available service .\nHe said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ d have to pay more than $ 30,000 to get internet cable extended just to his driveway .\nSo he has relied on wireless service from phone providers and weekend excursions to the parking lots of nearby businesses .\nUniversal broadband will be costly , but shelter-in-place orders have demonstrated that it is even more costly to leave so many Americans behind .\nA House bill to accelerate deployment of the $ 20.4 billion overseen by the Rural Digital Opportunity Fund is a start , but the F.C.C .\nhas estimated it could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ every American without broadband .\nHouse Democrats proposed in April that more than $ 80 billion be authorized over five years for broadband expansion .\n\u201c People are afraid of the price tag , \u201d said Mr. Clyburn , a co-sponsor of the bill along with Representative Fred Upton , Republican of Michigan .\n\u201c We can \u2019 t afford not to do it.\n\u201d Perhaps more daunting is the challenge of providing service that is speedy and at a price that even lower-income Americans can afford .\nOne study found that poorer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ month for internet service .\nBut such service is typically at far slower speeds than what is available in more affluent neighborhoods , or for free at Starbucks .\nPrivate industry may have little desire to provide lower-tier broadband service when it can profit far more from higher-end services .\nThe expansion of federal programs , like E-Rate , to allow schools to distribute broadband service directly to students could also help lower costs .\nBut those solutions are not a fix to the broader problem .\nDrawing Wi-Fi from school buses and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ solution .", "author": "", "url": "https://abcnews.go.com/US/wireStory/editorial-roundup-us-71925792", "published": "Wed, 22 Jul 2020 15:06:33 -0400", "published_utc": 1595444793, "collection_utc": 1595464238}, {"id": "abcnews--2020-07-23--Civil rights trailblazer C.T.

about any sustained recovery the rest of the year .\nA huge plunge in consumer spending as people stayed home and avoided shopping , traveling or gathering in crowds as the virus raged is estimated to have sent the economy sinking at a roughly 32 % annual rate in the April-June quarter .\nThat would be more than triple the previous worst quarterly economic fall , a 10 % drop set in 1958 .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ investment , home construction and government spending also likely contributed to the worst quarterly contraction on records dating to 1947 .\nOn Thursday , the government will issue its first

is still fragile .\nThe president remained out of sight Friday , beginning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ New Jersey , golf club .\nHis Democratic opponent , Joe Biden , was quick to blame Trump for the potentially

Biden said .\nMany economists are urging Congress to extend various forms of economic aid to sustain a recovery .\nA supplemental $ 600 weekly federal unemployment payment expired last week .\nHouse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Senate Republicans want to reduce it to $ 200 .\nAn eviction moratorium for federally subsidized housing has also ended .\nBoth sides have agreed to another $ 1,200 stimulus payment but

\u2019 s handling of the Jussie Smollett case , even though a special prosecutor this week concluded that nothing she or her staff did qualified as criminal .\nWhile stopping short of alleging criminal behavior , special prosecutor Dan Webb said Cook County State 's Attorney Kim Foxx and her staff abused their discretion and misled the public before and after tossing charges that accused the former \u201c Empire \u201d actor of staging a racist , anti-gay attack against himself in January 2019 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ earlier this year , but no trial date has been set as the pandemic has stalled Illinois court proceedings .\nFoxx , 48 , the first Black woman to serve in her post , is seeking a second four-year term in November .\nHere 's a look at the possible implications of Webb 's findings concerning her office : Q : WHAT WERE THE MAIN CRITICISMS OF FOXX ?\nA : The most serious accusations leveled by Webb , a former U.S. attorney , was that Foxx and a top deputy made at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ case .\nFoxx said publicly she had stopped communicating with a Smollett relative after doubts began to arise about his attack claims .\nBut Webb found Foxx continued to communicate with the relative , the actor \u2019 s sister .\nWebb did say , however , that he found no evidence Foxx \u2019 s communications with the sister and others outside the office influenced the decision to drop charges .\nFoxx also said publicly that the dropping of charges against Smollett was the kind of thing prosecutors had done thousands of times before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his conclusions , Webb said \u201c there were not thousands \u201d or \u201c arguably any \u201d similar such cases .\nWebb accused Foxx of also making false public statements in explaining why she recused herself from the Smollett investigation weeks after the actor filed what authorities say was a false police report .\nQ : HOW DOES THE DISCIPLINARY BODY COME INTO IT ?\nA : The false statements may have violated professional codes of conduct , including those that prohibit lawyers from engaging in \u201c conduct involving dishonesty , fraud , deceit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Monday .\nHe said he was obliged to forward the allegations about the false statements to the Illinois Attorney Registration & Disciplinary Commission , an agency overseen by the Illinois Supreme Court that assesses whether lawyers violated ethical and regulatory norms .\nThe ARDC only confirms it is looking into allegations after it formally accuses a lawyer of wrongdoing .\nAny such decision can take months .\nQ : IF THE COMMISSION FINDS A VIOLATION , COULD FOXX LOSE HER LAW LICENSE ?\nA : Disbarment or a temporary suspension of Foxx 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even if it 's a theoretical possibility should the ARDC ever conclude Foxx violated rules of conduct .\nChicago-based attorney Daniel Meyer , who has represented prosecutors accused of wrongdoing before the ARDC , says any discipline against a prosecutor for public comments would be unusual .\n\u201c In almost all instances , ( disciplinary commission ) charges brought against a prosecutor relate to the manner in which he or she prosecuted an actual case , \u201d Meyer said , citing examples such as trying to bury evidence that could help the defense @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as serious .\nIf the body concludes she did violate ethical rules , a less severe reprimand or censure would also be a possibility .\nThe state \u2019 s highest court makes the final determination on punishments .\nQ : DO THE FINDINGS PUT HER REELECTION PROSPECTS AT RISK ?\nA : Probably not .\nFoxx is a Democrat in an overwhelmingly Democratic city .\nAnd Chicago Democrats who win their primary races almost always go on to win the general election .\nThe last Republican Cook County state \u2019 s attorney was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ defeated by Democrat Dick Devine in 1996 .\nEven before the special prosecutor \u2019 s findings were released Monday , the GOP candidate for Cook County state \u2019 s attorney , former county Judge Pat O \u2019 Brien , sought to make Smollett a campaign issue .\nHe said at a news conference in March that Foxx \u2019 s handling of the case demonstrated her \u201c lack of integrity.\n\u201d But it seems unlikely such attacks will work .\nHer challengers in the Democratic primary also made the Smollett case a central line @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the race handily , with just over 50 percent of the vote .\nThe remainder of the vote was split between two challengers .\nWith many voting groups , Foxx remains popular for having adopted criminal justice reforms long before recent nationwide protests demanding reforms .\nHer policy changes included a decision to treat certain nonviolent crimes , such as shoplifting , as lower priorities .\nThat change angered Chicago \u2019 s police union and chiefs of police across Cook County , but it solidified Foxx 's support among reform advocates .\nA @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yet .\nA brief statement from Foxx \u2019 s office Monday said it welcomed Webb \u2019 s findings that no one on the staff committed a crime and that no outside influence affected prosecutors \u2019 charging decisions .\nBut it added it \u201c

"title": "It's US against most of UN council on Iran sanctions", "content": "UNITED NATIONS -- The United States and most of the rest of the U.N. Security Council dug in their heels Thursday on diametrically opposed positions over the restoration of international sanctions on Iran .\nIn increasingly intense rhetorical terms , U.S. officials insisted they had acted legitimately in triggering a so-called \u201c snapback \u201d mechanism that would re-impose all U.N. sanctions Iran next month .\nThey said the re-imposition of sanctions is a done deal and nothing can stop it .\n\u201c Last week , the U.S. triggered the 30-day process to restore virtually all UN sanctions on Iran after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mission to maintain international peace and security , \u201d Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said in a tweet .\n\u201c These sanctions will snap back at midnight GMT on September 20.\n\u201d But as they did when Pompeo traveled to the U.N. to invoke snapback , almost all other council members flatly rejected that position , repeating their position that the U.S. had lost its legal standing to act after President Donald Trump withdrew from the 2015 Iran nuclear deal two years ago .\nAt the heart of the dispute is the Security @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Plan of Action , or JCPOA , between Iran and six major powers \u2014 the U.S. , Russia , China , United Kingdom , France and Germany .\nIt allows \u201c a JCPOA participant state \u201d to trigger the \u201c snapback \u201d mechanism .\nThe U.S. insists that as an original JCPOA participant it has the legal right even though it ceased participating in 2018 .\nThe impasse sets the stage for a potential crisis in the Security Council next month with the United States claiming to have re-imposed the sanctions and most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Trump administration \u2019 s action is illegal and ignoring it .\nThe president of the council on Tuesday said there was overwhelming opposition in the 15-member body to the U.S. position and that it was unlikely there would be any action on Washington \u2019 s demand .\nBut Pompeo said that wouldn \u2019 t matter , citing the process for sanctions re-imposition outlined in council resolution that enshrined the nuclear deal .\nUnder the terms of that resolution , if a participant in the deal accuses Iran of \u201c significant non-performance , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ continue sanctions relief .\nThe U.S. would veto any such resolution .\n\u201c If any member of the UN Security Council introduces a resolution to continue sanctions relief , the U.S. will oppose it , \u201d Pompeo said .\n\u201c If no resolution is introduced , the sanctions on Iran will still return on September 20 .\nThat \u2019 s how UNSCR 2231 works.\n\u201d The European Union \u2019 s foreign policy chief , who coordinates the JCPOA \u2019 s Joint Commission , reiterated in response to Pompeo \u2019 s latest statement that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in 2018 \u201c it can not ... be considered to be a JCPOA participant state for the purposes of possible sanctions snapback foreseen by the resolution.\n\u201d EU High Representative Josep Borrell added that he \u201c will continue to do everything possible to ensure the preservation and full implementation of the JCPOA by all , \u201d saying it remains \u201c a key pillar \u201d of global nonproliferation that contributes to regional stability .\nThe EU announced last Friday that the six remaining parties to the JCPOA will meet in Vienna on Sept. 1 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dmitry Polyansky tweeted Thursday : \u201c Under intl law you can \u2019 t withdraw from an agreement and then claim you can still benefit from its provisions .\nUnder ` rules-based intl order \u2019 where the rules are defined by the US this seems to be OK provided it serves US interests.\n\u201d The Trump administration has been waging war on the nuclear deal for years .\nDuring the 2016 presidential campaign candidate Trump denounced it as the worst deal ever negotiated and has made no secret of his desire to blow it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is fatally flawed because certain restrictions on Iran 's nuclear activity gradually expire and will allow the country to eventually develop atomic weapons .\nJCPOA supporters warn that if the deal blows up or Iran pulls out it could pursue nuclear weapons .\nPompeo came to the United Nations last week to demand restoration of U.N. sanctions after the Security Council resoundingly rejected a U.S. resolution to indefinitely extend the U.N. arms embargo on Iran , which is set to expire Oct. 18 , in one of the first restrictions to be lifted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ United States .\nFormer Trump national security adviser John Bolton , who has long questioned the validity of the administration \u2019 s argument for snapback , told The Associated Press : \u201c The lesson you take away from this is for the United States it \u2019 s perfectly honorable to stand alone at the U.N. in vindication of our principles .\nBut at least you ought to try and do it smartly , and not so that you look foolish.\n\u201d \u201c I think we look foolish , \u201d he said .\n\u201c @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see here is what happens when you get into this kind of foolishness .\nIt really is too cute by half and now it is coming back to bite the United States , and it was entirely predictable

War have athletes made such a powerful statement .\nTo take the platform that they command and tell not just fans but politicians and officials that injustice can no longer be tolerated is a message that can \u2019 t be ignored .\nThe Bucks called on the Wisconsin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ take the court and represent Milwaukee and Wisconsin , we are expected to play at a high level , give maximum effort and hold each other accountable , \u201d the Bucks \u2019 George Hill said , reading from a statement by the players .\n\u201c We hold ourselves to that standard , and in this moment we are demanding the same from lawmakers and law enforcement.\n\u201d Few Black people command the undivided attention of millions like the Black players who compose 75 % of the NBA .\nWhether fans will understand the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the cancellation of a hotly anticipated playoff game , that \u2019 s a risk that these players took Wednesday ( and Thursday , when more teams postponed games ) .\nPredictably , President Trump dismissed the move and accused the NBA of becoming \u201c a political organization.\n\u201d His son-in-law , Jared Kushner , the ultimate child of privilege and wealth , snidely remarked in a television interview that it was easy for wealthy players to take a night off .\nIt may have been a night off from playing but it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ men , or from feeling a responsibility to use their clout to try to change a society where white officers gun down people who share the players \u2019 skin color .\nYes , there \u2019 s some anger behind this kind of protest , but there \u2019 s more anguish .\nHis voice breaking with emotion , Clippers Coach Doc Rivers said Tuesday : \u201c It \u2019 s amazing why we keep loving this country and this country does not love us back.\n\u201d That \u2019 s a heartbreak that everyone should try @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it would resume playoff games Friday or Saturday .\nWe wish the players could stay off the court until all law enforcement officers acted as if Black lives mattered , or at least until sports fans across the country recognized the problem of systemic racism and took it upon themselves to solve it .\nBut , then , who knows when the NBA would ever play again .\nThe Chicago Tribune on Kyle Rittenhouse and the Wisconsin protests : This much we can say with certainty : A 17-year-old visibly armed with a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ violent protest is a powder keg by itself .\nKyle Rittenhouse of Antioch has been arrested and charged as an adult so far in connection with two deaths in Kenosha .\nThis much we also can say : The tragedy that unfolded was avoidable .\nThere was a heavy law enforcement presence in Kenosha late Tuesday and into Wednesday .\nThere was a curfew in place .\nThere were demonstrators defying the curfew , breaking glass with hammers , and setting buildings and vehicles on fire .\nAnd there were groups of armed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of whom were self-organized in what they called the Kenosha Guard .\nIn the middle of it was Rittenhouse , earlier seen being interviewed on camera , rifle dangling near his side , speaking with confidence about his \u201c job \u201d and responsibilities .\n\u201c People are getting injured .\nOur job is to protect this business , \u201d he said in footage compiled by The New York Times .\nAnother video posted on Twitter from the account @ ElijahSchaffer of BlazeTV , a conservative outlet , shows what appeared to be a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pants pocket and aiming it at cameras .\nSome people at the protests were peaceful .\nSome were armed and angry .\nThat \u2019 s a powder keg , too .\nThere \u2019 s a lot we don \u2019 t know about the shootings and their aftermath , whether Rittenhouse was in Kenosha on his own or belonged to a group .\nWisconsin allows the open carry of weapons , which gives citizens the right to be armed in many public places .\nKenosha County Sheriff David Beth said he was asked to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enforcement during the protests , to which he replied : \u201c Oh hell no.\n\u201d Rightly .\nBut let \u2019 s be clear : Individuals can arm themselves to protect private property in the state of Wisconsin .\nThey can do it here , too , with proper registration .\nDuring on-and-off looting in Chicago and surrounding communities this summer , some business owners and groups organized to stave off further looting .\nIllinois is not an open carry state , but it does allow concealed carry for gun owners who undergo training @ @ @ @ @ @ @ state law forced by court challenge and carried out by a Democratic legislature .\nAccording to at least one report , gun sales this year are up an estimated 72 % nationally compared with this time last year , the Washington Times reported , a reflection of growing insecurity in safety across the country and in several demographic groups .\nThe problem with armed militias , though , should be an obvious one : They \u2019 re not trained as law enforcement personnel and should have no role assisting police during a riot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ car dealership is different from patrolling the streets .\nThe first may be acceptable in emergency situations ; the second is dangerous and irresponsible .\nAnd the fact that Rittenhouse , age 17 , was there at all with a loaded weapon presented a grave risk to everyone .\nHe was too young to open carry , according to the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel .\nHe was violating curfew .\nHe was too inexperienced to act as armed security .\nHe reportedly had an infatuation with law enforcement but had no legitimate reason to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that night .\nAnd so : Just as we should expect legitimate , peaceful protesters in cities across the country to police themselves \u2014 to assume some responsibility when rioters invade their midst and begin engaging violently with police \u2014 we should expect self-described militia organizations to obey the law , respect the role of law enforcement , police themselves \u2014 and assume some responsibility for rogue vigilantes who join their cause .\nPlenty went wrong in Kenosha this week .\nThe result has been tragic .\nFor anyone needing a reminder , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Vladimir Putin \u2019 s sphere of influence has been all too apparent this week .\nThe leader of the Belarusian democracy movement , Svetlana Tikhanovskaya , remains in exile in Lithuania , as President Alexander Lukashenko keeps in close touch with Moscow on the phone and rounds up opponents in Minsk .\nMeanwhile , Alexei Navalny , the Russian opposition leader and thorn in Mr Putin \u2019 s side , lies in a medically induced coma having almost certainly been poisoned , according to the German doctors treating him .\nMr Navalny was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his family , after falling ill on a flight from Siberia to Moscow last week .\nAs the medical team at the Charit\u00e9 hospital gave its diagnosis , the German chancellor , Angela Merkel , called for a full and transparent investigation by Russian authorities and demanded that those responsible be brought to justice .\nShe will not be holding her breath .\nLast year , Ms Merkel directly confronted Mr Putin over the killing of another political opponent in Berlin .\nTwo Russian diplomats were eventually expelled after Moscow refused to cooperate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ state agents charged with the novichok poisoning of the former spy , Sergei Skripal , in Salisbury , are safely back in Russia and will almost certainly never face trial .\nMr Navalny \u2019 s bravery in prosecuting his anti-corruption crusade over the last decade can not be overstated .\nHe has been imprisoned on 13 occasions for organising anti-Putin protests , has endured physical attacks and was hospitalised after a mysterious \u201c allergic attack \u201d last year .\nThe day before he collapsed last week , a group of young supporters reportedly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ t you dead yet ?\n\u201d Thankfully , although Mr Navalny \u2019 s long-term prognosis remains unclear , it seems likely he will survive this grim episode .\nIn Belarus , enormous levels of civic courage are also in evidence , as protests against Mr Lukashenko \u2019 s effective dictatorship continue into a third week after the rigged election of 9 August .\nOn Sunday , for the second successive weekend , vast crowds turned out on the streets of Minsk , defying security forces who President Lukashenko had ordered to \u201c solve @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yesterday of two opposition leaders suggest the regime intends to pick off prominent critics and tough things out until numbers drop and a crackdown can take place .\nOver the weekend , the Russian foreign minister , Sergei Lavrov , indicated the Kremlin \u2019 s backing for the president , claiming that Ms Tikhanovskaya \u2019 s movement was seeking to provoke \u201c bloodshed \u201d in Belarus .\nThe disregard for democracy and civil rights in Russia and Belarus is clear .\nWhat the west , and the European Union in particular , can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The EU has refused to recognise the Belarusian election result and will impose sanctions on those involved in orchestrating electoral fraud and repression .\nIt is understandably reluctant to go further , for fear of vindicating claims in Moscow and Minsk that the protests are a convenient vehicle for western interests .\nBut in the event of more bloody repression , or a direct Russian intervention , more robust action may be unavoidable .\nRelations with Mr Putin have been close to freezing since the Skripal poisoning , but Mr Navalny himself has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Mr Putin with connections to the west .\nMs Merkel \u2019 s backing of the Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline between Russia and Germany is also likely to come under renewed scrutiny in light of ongoing events .\nThese are not easy matters to assess when the wrong move could be damagingly counter-productive .\nEurope will need to continue to deal and engage with Russia .\nIn Belarus , it may be that mediation by the neutral Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe becomes the appropriate avenue to lobby towards .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ rights are trampled with impunity can not be an option .", "author": "", "url":

"content": "UNITED NATIONS -- Born out of World War II \u2019 s devastation to prevent the scourge of conflict , the United Nations marked its 75th anniversary Monday with an appeal from Secretary-General Antonio Guterres to preserve the longest period in modern history without a military confrontation between the world \u2019 s most powerful nations .\nThe U.N. chief told the mainly virtual official commemoration that \u201c it took two world wars , millions of deaths and the horrors of the Holocaust for world leaders to commit to international cooperation and the rule of law , \u201d and that commitment produced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u2014 which so many had feared \u2014 has been avoided , \u201d Guterres said .\n\u201c This is a major achievement of which member states can be proud \u2014 and which we must all strive to preserve.\n\u201d His appeal came at an inflection point in history , as the United Nations navigates a polarized world facing a pandemic , regional conflicts , a shrinking economy , growing inequality and escalating U.S.-China tensions .\nU.S. President Donald Trump was on the speaker list for the commemoration , but he did not speak .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the United States was represented by its acting deputy U.N. ambassador , Cherith Norman Chalet .\nThe White House had no immediate comment .\n\u201c In many ways , the United Nations has proven to be a successful experiment , \u201d Chalet said .\nBut for too long , she added , it has resisted \u201c meaningful reform , \u201d lacked transparency and been \u201c too vulnerable to the agenda of autocratic regimes and dictatorships.\n\u201d \u201c New threats require new agility from the U.N. , \u201d she said , citing theft @ @ @ @ @ @ @ undermine internet freedom.\n\u201d Guterres cited other major U.N. achievements over 75 years : peace treaties and peacekeeping missions , decolonization , setting human rights standards , \u201c the triumph over apartheid \u201d in South Africa , eradication of diseases , a steady reduction in hunger , development of international law and landmark pacts to protect the environment .\nBut today , he warned , \u201c climate calamity looms , biodiversity is collapsing , poverty is rising , hatred is spreading , geopolitical tensions are escalating , nuclear weapons remain on hair-trigger alert.\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ technologies have produced opportunities \u201c but also exposed new threats.\n\u201d In an AP interview in June , Guterres said the U.N. \u2019 s biggest failing was its inability to prevent medium and small conflicts .\nAnd 25 years after world leaders meeting in Beijing adopted a 150-page platform to achieve equality for women , he said Monday that \u201c gender inequality remains the greatest single challenge to human rights around the world.\n\u201d Appealing for the world \u2019 s nations and people to work together , Guterres said , \u201c the COVID-19 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ s fragilities \u201d which can only be addressed together .\n\u201c Today we have a surplus of multilateral challenges and a deficit of multilateral solutions , \u201d the secretary-general said .\nGuyana \u2019 s President Irfaan Mohamed Ali , the head of what 's called the Group of 77 and China \u2014 the main U.N. bloc of developing countries that now has 134 member states \u2014 said the commemoration \u201c must send a strong and positive signal to the peoples of the world of our commitment to multilateralism and our resolve to strive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Chinese President Xi Jinping urged U.N. members to renew a commitment to multilateralism and \u201c work to promote a community with a shared future for mankind.\n\u201d \u201c Unilateralism is a dead end , \u201d he said .\n\u201c No country has the right to dominate global affairs , control the destiny of others or keep advantages in development all to itself .\nEven less should one be allowed to do whatever it likes and be the hegemon , bully or boss of the world.\n\u201d While the U.N. has been criticized for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its primary mission of ensuring global peace , it nonetheless remains the one place that its 193 member nations can meet to talk .\nAs frustrating as its lack of progress often is , especially when it comes to preventing and ending crises , there is also strong support for the U.N. \u2019 s power to bring not only nations but people of all ages from all walks of life , ethnicities and religions together to discuss critical issues like climate change .\nThe United Nations marked its actual 75th anniversary \u2014 the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Francisco on June 26 , 1945 by delegates from about 50 countries \u2014 on that date this year at an event scaled down because of the coronavirus pandemic .\nMonday \u2019 s mainly virtual official commemoration was not a celebration .\nIt included some grim video footage of the crises and conflicts during the U.N. \u2019 s history , as well as high points and successes .\nOne highlight : the adoption of a declaration on the U.N. \u2019 s 75th anniversary , approved by diplomats from all U.N. member states in June @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the U.N. \u2019 s successes and failures over more than seven decades and vows to build a post-pandemic world that is more equal , works together , and protects the planet .\n\u201c The urgency for all countries to come together , to fulfill the promise of the nations united , has rarely been greater , \u201d it says , while praising the United Nations as the only global organization that \u201c gives hope to so many people for a better world and can deliver the future we want.\n\u201d Even at times @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the U.N. promoted decolonization , freedom , development , human rights and equality for women and men , \u201c and worked to eradicate disease.\n\u201d And it \u201c helped mitigate dozens of conflicts , saved hundreds of thousands of lives through humanitarian action and provided millions of children with the education that every child deserves.\n\u201d As for disappointments , the declaration says the world \u201c is plagued by growing inequality , poverty , hunger , armed conflicts , terrorism , insecurity , climate change and pandemics.\n\u201d It says the poorest and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ decolonization is not complete , and people are forced to make dangerous journeys in search of refuge .\n\u201c It \u2019 s very unfortunate that it \u2019 s going to be a pretty gloomy celebration for the U.N , \u201d said Richard Gowan , U.N. director for the Crisis Group , a Brussels-based think tank .\nA year ago , Guterres warned leaders attending the General Assembly \u2019 s high-level meeting of the looming risk of the world splitting in two , with the United States and China creating rival internets , currency @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their own zero-sum geopolitical and military strategies.\n\u201d Former Trump national security adviser John Bolton , a longtime U.N. critic who previously served as U.N. ambassador , said the United Nations did not meet expectations at the end of the Cold War in the early 1990s \u201c that with Cold War gridlock removed , it would once again be effective.\n\u201d Bolton said Trump isn \u2019 t going to tackle the U.N. reforms that he would like to see if he wins a second term .\n\u201c I think he doesn \u2019 t @ @ @ @ @ @ @ care about it , like much of the world of foreign policy , \u201d Bolton said .\nIf Democratic candidate Joe Biden wins , \u201c they \u2019 ll want to do more through the U.N. , but I don \u2019 t think they \u2019 ve thought it through either , \u201d Bolton said .\n\u201c So I think you \u2019 re at a period of uncertainty that \u2019 s going to last for some time.\n\u201d Longtime international correspondent Edith M.

meeting", "content": "UNITED NATIONS -- Kept apart by a devastating pandemic and dispersed across the globe , world leaders convened electronically Tuesday for an unprecedented high-level meeting , where the U.N. chief exhorted them to unite and tackle the era \u2019 s towering problems : the coronavirus , the \u201c economic calamity \u201d it unleashed and the risk of a new Cold War between the United States and China .\nAs Secretary-General Antonio Guterres opened the first virtual \u201c general debate \u201d of the U.N. General Assembly , the yawning gaps of politics and anger became evident .\nChina and Iran clashed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ videos from home \u2014 and leaders expressed frustration and anger at the handling of the COVID-19 pandemic , which the U.N. chief has called \u201c the number one global security threat in our world today.\n\u201d As he began his speech , the secretary-general looked out at the vast General Assembly chamber , where only one mask-wearing diplomat from each of the U.N. \u2019 s 193 member nations was allowed to sit , socially distanced from one another .\n\u201c The COVID-19 pandemic has changed our annual meeting beyond recognition , \u201d Guterres @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it more important than ever.\n\u201d While the six-day mainly virtual meeting is unique in the U.N. \u2019 s 75-year history , the speeches from leaders hit on all the conflicts , crises and divisions facing a world that Guterres said is witnessing \u201c rising inequalities , climate catastrophe , widening societal divisions , rampant corruption.\n\u201d In his grim state of the world speech , he said \u201c the pandemic has exploited these injustices , preyed on the most vulnerable and wiped away the progress of decades , \u201d including sparking the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nThe secretary-general called for global unity , foremost to fight the pandemic , and sharply criticized populism and nationalism for failing to contain the virus and for often making things worse .\nTurkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan criticized how \u201c countries were left on their own \u201d at the onset of the pandemic , stressing that \u201c effective multilateralism requires effective multilateral institutions.\n\u201d He urged rapid U.N. reforms , starting with the Security Council , the most powerful body with five veto-wielding members \u2014 the U.S. , China , Russia , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro , whose country has reported the second-highest coronavirus death toll after the U.S. , trumpeted his focus on the economy in dealing with the pandemic .\nBolsonaro lambasted \u201c segments of the Brazilian media \u201d for \u201c spreading panic \u201d by encouraging stay-at-home orders and prioritizing public health over the economy .\nHe 's downplayed the severity of the coronavirus and repeatedly said shutting down the economy would inflict worse hardship on people .\nGuterres told the virtual audience that \u201c too often , there has also been a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ year ago , he warned about the rising U.S.-China rivalry , saying Tuesday : \u201c We are moving in a very dangerous direction.\n\u201d \u201c Our world can not afford a future where the two largest economies split the globe in a great fracture \u2014 each with its own trade and financial rules and internet and artificial intelligence capacities , \u201d Guterres said .\n\u201c We must avoid this at all costs.\n\u201d The rivalry between the two powers was in full display as President Donald Trump , in a very short virtual @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hold Beijing \u201c accountable \u201d for failing to contain the virus that originated in the Chinese city of Wuhan and has killed over 200,000 Americans and nearly 1 million worldwide .\nChina \u2019 s ambassador rejected all accusations against Beijing as \u201c totally baseless.\n\u201d \u201c At this moment , the world needs more solidarity and cooperation , and not a confrontation , \u201d U.N .\nAmbassador Zhang Jun said before introducing President Xi Jinping \u2019 s prerecorded speech .\n\u201c We need to increase mutual confidence and trust , and not the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Emmanuel Macron said the pandemic should be \u201c an electric shock \u201d to encourage more multilateral action .\nOtherwise , he warned , the world will be \u201c collectively condemned to a pas de deux \u201d by the U.S. and China in which everyone else is \u201c reduced to being nothing but the sorry spectators of a collective impotence.\n\u201d Tensions with the U.S. also dominated a fiery speech by Iranian President Hassan Rouhani , whose country is facing the worst COVID-19 crisis in the Middle East .\nHe lashed out at U.S. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not submit to U.S. pressure .\nRouhani said the United States can \u2019 t impose negotiations or war on Iran , stressing that his country is \u201c not a bargaining chip in U.S. elections and domestic policy.\n\u201d He used the May death of Black American George Floyd under the knee of a white Minneapolis police officer as a metaphor for Iran \u2019 s \u201c own experience \u201d with the United States .\n\u201c We instantly recognize the feet kneeling on the neck as the feet of arrogance on the neck of independent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tensions have run dangerously high this year , and Trump signed an executive order this week to enforce all U.N. sanctions on Iran because it \u2019 s not complying with a 2015 nuclear deal with world powers \u2014 a move he touted in his U.N. speech but that most of the world rejects as illegal .\nSimilarly , Russian President Vladimir Putin stressed the need for multilateral cooperation against the pandemic , urging an end to \u201c illegitimate sanctions \u201d against his country and others that he said could boost the global economy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cyril Ramaphosa , speaking on behalf of the African Union , said rich nations haven \u2019 t been

Wade , the landmark 1973 decision , has been an animating political issue exploited by both sides .\nHer writings and speeches show a commitment to originalism , a concept that involves justices endeavoring to decipher original meanings of texts in assessing whether someone \u2019 s rights have been violated .\nMany liberals say that approach is too rigid and doesn \u2019 t allow the

as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reasoned arguments .\nAra Lovitt , who clerked with her , recalled at her investiture ceremony for the 7th Circuit that Scalia had high praise for her .\nOn Saturday , Barrett also referenced the close friendship between Ginsburg and fellow opera lover Scalia , saying Ginsburg showed that justices can disagree on principles \u201c without rancor in person.\n\u201d Before becoming a judge , Barrett discussed how court precedents provide welcome stability in the law .\nBut she seemed to leave the door open to the possibility of reversing ones about which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a precedent is deeply rooted , '' a 2017 article in the University of Pennsylvania Journal of Constitutional Law , which Barrett co-wrote , said , `` the Court is no longer required to deal with the

after Barrett 's 7th Circuit nomination .\nThat prompted Republicans to accuse Democrats of seeking to impose a religious test on Barrett 's fitness for the job .\nAt Notre Dame , where Barrett began

it too hard to predict how she might rule , concerned she could end up like other seemingly conservatives who wound up more moderate .\nThree years on , her record now includes around 100 opinions and dissents , in which she often illustrated Scalia \u2019 s influence by delving deep into historical minutiae to glean the meaning of original texts .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ case , Barrett argued a person convicted of a nonviolent felony shouldn \u2019 t be automatically barred from owning a gun .\nAll but a few pages of her 37-page dissent were devoted to the history of gun laws in the 18th and 19th centuries .\nBarrett twice joined dissenting opinions asking for abortion-related decisions to be thrown out and reheard by the full court .\nLast year , after a three-judge panel blocked an Indiana

"content": "Excerpts from recent editorials in the United States and abroad : The Republican of Springfield , Massachusetts , on how the U.S. Supreme Court ruling cutting the census short could have lasting impacts : When you don \u2019 t truly believe that all the people count , it only makes sense not to count all the people .\nHow else can one explain the White House \u2019 s efforts to screw up the decennial census , which received the blessing of the U.S. Supreme Court on Tuesday , when justices said the administration could move ahead with its plan to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ White House recently announced that this years enumeration of the people was 99.9 % complete , the figure seemed , well , too good to be true .\nAfter all , the Commerce Department had tried to wrap up the census early , despite reports of widespread problems .\nIn particular , it seemed that specific groups were routinely being undercounted -- minorities , young people and the poor .\nThink it \u2019 s merely a coincidence that folks in those groups aren \u2019 t generally wild about President Donald Trump ?\nThe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ States , mandated by the Constitution , was conducted in 1790 .\nThe idea , seemingly so simple , was actually quite radical : In a nation where the people are the ultimate authority , with the power of those in the federal bureaucracy obtained only by the consent of the governed , it is imperative to have an accurate count of the people , and to know where they live .\nWe \u2019 ve done this every 10 years since , trying always to count everyone .\nUntil now .\nBecause Trump @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be counted .\nAnd while that notion didn \u2019 t initially pass muster in the federal courts , Tuesday \u2019 s emergency ruling from the Supremes effectively hands Trump the win he wanted .\nSadly .\nThis is no way to run our nation \u2019 s 24th census , which should be as free from political interference as can be .\nAnd if we get it badly wrong this time around , there won \u2019 t be an opportunity to fix it until 2030 .\nThe census , of course , is used @ @ @ @ @ @ @ representatives in the House .\nEach state gets one to start with , and then the rest are divvied up by population , in an effort to see that congressional districts are more or less the same size .\nBut that \u2019 s only one aspect of the count .\nVast amounts of federal funds are also handed out based on population figures .\nAs a result , this year \u2019 s undercount will deprive already-underserved communities even further .\nShowing that in the eyes of this administration , they simply don \u2019 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ calls for a ceasefire and the opening up of diplomatic talks in the conflict between Armenia and Azerbaijan : The ongoing fighting between Armenian rebels and the Azerbaijani Army in Nagorno-Karabakh , a self-declared republic within Azerbaijan , risks becoming a wider regional conflict .\nThough Armenia and Azerbaijan agreed to a Russia-mediated ceasefire last week after days of fighting , the truce crumbled immediately amid a blame game .\nWhatever the truth is , an emboldened Azerbaijan , backed by Turkey , seems determined to press ahead with its offensive .\nThe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The region , largely populated by ethnic Armenians , is located within the international boundaries of Azerbaijan .\nUnder the Soviet Union , it was an autonomous province that was part of the Azerbaijan republic .\nIn 1988 , when the Soviet power was receding , the regional assembly in Nagorno-Karabakh voted to join Armenia , triggering ethnic clashes .\nAfter the Soviet disintegration in 1991 , Armenia and Azerbaijan went to war over this largely mountainous , forested enclave .\nBy the time a ceasefire was reached in 1994 , the rebels @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , had established their de facto rule and extended their influence to the Armenian border .\nEver since , the border has remained tense .\nWhat makes the clashes now far more dangerous is the external intervention .\nTurkey has called Armenia a threat to peace in the region ; the Azeris and Turks share ethnic and linguistic bonds .\nAlso , the pre-Soviet Azerbaijan was a local ally of the Ottomans when they invaded Transcaucasia in the last leg of World War I .\nFor Turkey , which , under President Recep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its geopolitical reach to the former Ottoman regions , the conflict over Nagorno-Karabakh is an opportunity to enter the South Caucasus .\nTurkey also has a particularly bad relationship with Armenia .\nBut its problem is that Armenia is a member of the Russia-led Collective Security Treaty Organization ( CSTO ) .\nRussia enjoys good economic and defence ties with both Armenia and Azerbaijan .\nBut Armenia , as a CSTO member and host to a Russian military base , has more weight .\nIn a wider conflict , Armenia could trigger Article @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for Russian help .\nAnd if Moscow responds favourably , that would pit Russia against Turkey , a NATO member .\nRussia , already involved in military conflicts in Syria , Ukraine and Libya , may not like opening another front .\nThat is why it has re-emphasised its neutrality and hosted talks in Moscow for a truce .\nBut it will be forced to take sides if the conflict spills into Armenia .\nBoth sides should understand the volatile situation and call off the hostilities .\nNagorno-Karabakh has in the past witnessed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a regional war , Azerbaijan , Armenia and the Karabakh rebels should go back to the ceasefire and open up diplomatic channels .\nThe Washington Post on Facebook 's new policies aiming to reduce misinformation ahead of the U.S. general election : Facebook last week unveiled an expansion of its previously announced policies to fight confusion , misinformation and general malfeasance as election results roll in next month .\nThese steps include a much-discussed suspension of all social issue , electoral and political ads after polls close on Nov. 3 , in addition @ @ @ @ @ @ @ political ads in the previous week .\nThe change is more distraction than solution ; political ads were only the problem insofar as they were a loophole through which false claims could slip .\nThose false claims are the real menace \u2014 which is why Facebook \u2019 s other efforts are more important , and why on their own they \u2019 re unlikely to be enough .\nThe debate over political ads started as a fight about fact-checking .\nA freeze on ads after the election might do some good by preventing President @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , yet it will also prevent his opponents from correcting the record , should he continue to churn out the lies he is accustomed to sharing in his normal , unmonetized posts .\nAnd because the president has also rallied around him a right-wing apparatus of fringe personalities ready to share his latest claim , he holds the advantage .\nFacebook \u2019 s proposals on this front are promising , but their effects on democracy will be in the details .\nFacebook already planned to append \u201c informational \u201d labels to premature declarations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ labels to content concerning the legitimacy of the election .\nNow it will extend its partnership with Reuters to put notifications of the latest results atop Facebook and Instagram \u2014 plus , after major media outlets announce a victor , it will add that person \u2019 s name to posts from both candidates .\nThe question is what these labels will look like .\nDoes a post from Mr. Trump claiming he has won before ballots have been tallied deserve the same label as a post from Joe Biden counseling supporters to wait @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out explicitly as incorrect ?\nThen there \u2019 s the content Facebook theoretically will remove outright , such as posts calling for poll watchers that include militaristic or otherwise intimidating language .\nWhere will the platform draw its lines ?\nThis last update to Facebook \u2019 s policies cuts to the core of the problem .\nThe company is essentially playing catch-up to the president and his allies , who have been exhorting supporters to \u201c defend \u201d their ballots or join an \u201c army.\n\u201d Tweak after tweak responds to the unprecedented @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the integrity of the election .\nA recent paper from scholars at Harvard University tracking the disinformation campaign surrounding mail-in voting determined that social media played only a supporting role in an effort that was driven by mass media and elites .\nFacebook could and should fact-check more , or take down more , and it could even adjust its underlying algorithm that rewards sensationalism .\nBut the platform can not fix Donald Trump .\nIt can only try to manage his deceptions .\nThe Wall Street Journal on partisan divides during Amy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hearings : The Senate confirmation hearings for Amy Coney Barrett may lack for political drama , but they are still instructive .\nThey are revealing the deep fault lines over the Supreme Court , and how Democrats view it as a mini-legislature to achieve policy goals , rather than a real judicial body .\nDemocrats are asking very little about the actual law or Judge Barrett \u2019 s jurisprudential thinking .\nInstead , one after another , Democrats have used their time to focus on a parade of policy horribles if she is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they brought along photo displays of children and women who would supposedly be her victims on health care , abortion , gun violence and more .\nAll of this distorts the role of a judge , who has to rule based on what the law is , not on what she would want it to be .\n\u201c Judges can \u2019 t just wake up one day and say \u2018 I have an agenda .\nI like guns .\nI hate guns .\nI like abortion , I hate abortion \u2019 and walk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their will on the world , \u201d Judge Barrett said Tuesday .\nBut that is lost on Democrats , who are treating the hearings like a campaign rally .\nStart with their focus on Judge Barrett as a threat to health insurance .\nRepublican state attorneys general , joined by the Trump Administration , argue in a case that the Court will hear on Nov. 10 that the Affordable Care Act should be struck down .\nRecall that Chief Justice John Roberts in 2012 upheld the individual mandate to carry health insurance as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reform zeroed out the financial penalty for not being insured .\nThe AGs say that because there now is no tax , the entire law should be struck down .\nAs we \u2019 ve argued , the AG suit is political and legal malpractice because the lawsuit has almost no chance of success .\nThree conservative Justices have suggested in opinions this year that they are wary of throwing out entire laws due to discrete constitutionally defective provisions , and with good reason .\nThe vote could be 9-0 .\nYet Democrats assert @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Court would threaten protections for millions of Americans with pre-existing conditions , insurance coverage for young adults , free mammograms and birth control as well as lead to higher prescription costs for seniors .\n\u201c It \u2019 s all at stake , \u201d Kamala Harris declared .\nImagine if GOP Senators displayed photos of crime victims for a Democratic nominee who had overturned a conviction on appeal ?\nThey would be skewered as demagogues .\nCalifornia Sen. Dianne Feinstein asked how Judge Barrett would handle the ACA \u2019 s lifetime coverage caps @ @ @ @ @ @ @ consider this like any \u201c issue that would arise under the Affordable Care Act or any other statute should be determined by the law\u2014by looking at the text of the statute , by looking at precedent.\n\u201d Good answer .\nCoverage caps are a policy issue for Congress .\nDemocrats also flogged Judge Barrett for criticizing the Chief Justice \u2019 s creative interpretation of the individual mandate as a tax .\nShe joins a long queue there .\nBut Judge Barrett replied : \u201c I am not hostile to the ACA .\nI @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you pass .\n...\nI apply the law .\nI follow the law .\nYou make the policy.\n\u201d She also said \u201c reliance interests , \u201d such as the number of people who gained insurance under ObamaCare , have to be considered now that the law has been in place for six years .\nDemocrats also distorted the risks that the Court will overturn Obergefell v. Hodges that divined a right to same-sex marriage in the Constitution because Justice Antonin Scalia dissented and Judge Barrett was his clerk .\nYet Justice Scalia @ @ @ @ @ @ @ preferences by diktat .\nAs he explained , \u201c the substance of today \u2019 s decree is not of immense personal importance to me , \u201d but the judiciary \u2019 s hubris in divining a new right signified \u201c that my Ruler , and the Ruler of 320 million Americans coast-to-coast , is a majority of the nine lawyers on the Supreme Court.\n\u201d He was right then , but tens of thousands of same-sex Americans have been married since Obergefell .\nThis is the definition of a \u201c reliance interest , \u201d @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There is no way a conservative Court is going to invalidate those marriages .\nThe current \u201c conservative \u201d Court has already shown it is more heterodox than one dominated by liberals .\nThat \u2019 s because originalists seek to interpret laws based on the text and the Constitution rather than merely find a way to arrive at a foregone policy result .\nEverything we know suggests Judge Barrett will rule in the same originalist way , and this should reassure the public that the Court will be properly modest in interpreting the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doing a great disservice to the law and judiciary by treating these hearings like an emotive political ad .\nThey are telling voters that the courts are nothing more than another arena for political disputes .\nKeep doing that and soon the Supreme Court will be as unpopular as Congress \u2014 which may be their real goal as they prepare the ground to pack the Court next year .\nThe Denver Post on the shooting of a Colorado man during a rally to support police : Lee Keltner \u2014 a Denver-area hat maker @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u2014 was shot and killed in downtown Denver while attending a rally to support the police and after a physical altercation with an armed man providing security for a television producer .\nKeltner \u2019 s death , like several across the U.S. that have occurred during protests since the death of George Floyd , is a tragedy .\nAmericans must find ways to gather and express their views , to be vocal and passionate , and to also be peaceful and non-violent .\nAnd we are sure all Americans can agree that no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a verbal or physical fight , spraying mace , resisting arrest , grabbing a police officer \u2019 s spent Taser , serving this country as a police officer , or exercising the right to peacefully assemble .\nWe don \u2019 t pretend to know what transpired before or after Keltner was shot ; we are waiting on additional information from the police investigation .\nAn attorney representing Dolloff \u2019 s family said that Dolloff was protecting a journalist and acted in self-defense .\nJust like thousands of others , we \u2019 ve seen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Richardson captured showing the moments before and after Keltner was shot .\nIt need not be said that Richardson displayed incredible bravery and dedication to her role as a journalist capturing these moments of strife and division in America .\nWe know from Richardson \u2019 s photos that Keltner slaps Dolloff .\nDolloff appears in another photo to be reaching for his gun .\nThen another image shows Keltner spraying a cloud of pepper spray as Dolloff fires his gun ( the photo captures a shell casing in the air . )\nKeltner @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dolloff had been hired as a security guard to accompany a 9News producer who was covering the protests , police and a 9News source have said .\nHowever , it \u2019 s unclear what company , if any , Dolloff was employed through and whether he was properly licensed to be a private security guard in Denver .\nIt doesn \u2019 t matter what Keltner or Dolloff thought of Black Lives Matter or police .\nWhat matters is that one man was killed , and the Denver district attorney must determine if this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We can not help but note the reversal of roles in this situation , and it \u2019 s possible that if Coloradans can step back from this tragedy dispassionately , they could find common ground .\nA man is dead who did not appear to use or threaten lethal force ( we \u2019 ll wait for the investigation to tell us whether he was unarmed or not and what words were exchanged ) , and the question is whether the shooting was in some way justified .\nIt \u2019 s a question that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ times this year .\nAll of these deaths and shootings \u2014 whether it was at the hands of a police officer , a private security guard , an armed teen trying to protect private property , a protester recklessly firing a gun at a moving vehicle or anyone else \u2014 should lead us to question whether our self-defense laws are serving justice or permitting murder .\nAre we empowering people to protect themselves and others or are we making our public spaces unsafe with our laws ?\nAs a society , we must @ @ @ @ @ @ @ across the nation in 2020 and consider the answers to those questions .\nWe must protect the right to assemble .\nThe San Francisco Chronicle on the effects of the Trump administration 's tightening of tech visas : For years Washington has debated the fate of a subset of the immigration picture : the flow of trained , sought-after foreign tech workers allowed entry under a visa lottery program .\nNow the Trump administration is stepping in with a sledgehammer to lower the numbers and tighten the rules .\nIt \u2019 s a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ House that \u2019 s bidding to reduce immigration , especially on the eve of an election .\nBut there are also real problems with the specialized entry permits known as H-1B visas .\nThe Bay Area \u2019 s sprawling tech world has a ringside seat in the brewing situation .\nThe Trump plan devised by the Department of Labor and Homeland Security agency will firmly restrict the prized visas doled out by the luck of the draw .\nThe current lottery reserves 20,000 slots for applicants with a master \u2019 s degree or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to all applicants Under the proposed rules , foreign workers would need to be paid more , their credentials linked more directly to stateside jobs and permitted stays would be shortened in some cases .\nAnd one more thing : The new guidelines would cut the numbers by a third , predicted Homeland Security official Ken Cuccinelli .\nThat estimate comes on top of a prior surge in rejections of tech visa requests .\nThe plan requires that overseas applicants have a college degree , not simply work experience , to qualify for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ next Steve Jobs or Bill Gates , who didn \u2019 t graduate from college , from coming from overseas .\nThe changes also zero in on third-party hiring agencies with compliance rules and a limit of a one-year visa in place of the present three years .\nIt \u2019 s anything but a welcome sign to outside talent .\nSlamming the brakes on H-1B programs is sold as protection for American workers seeking the same jobs .\nWith COVID-19 devastating the economy and a jobless rate stuck at 7.9 % , the Trump @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a scapegoat .\n\u201c America \u2019 s immigration laws should put American workers first , \u201d said Patrick Pizzella , the deputy secretary of labor who took part in presenting the plan .\nThat message has gone out from the early days of the administration .\nBut a package of changes to halt H-1B visas announced in June and tied to the COVID outbreak were stopped by a federal court decision in San Francisco last week .\nNow comes a new strategy .\nIt involves an initiative that doesn \u2019 t need major @ @ @ @ @ @ @ effect quickly .\nThat shortened schedule , though , will invite yet another court challenge that could stall the latest announcement .\nBeyond legal gambits , there are undeniable problems .\nThe tech guest workers in some instances are underpaid compared to U.S. employees pounding out code down the hall .\nLining up foreign workers has led to a small group of personnel agencies that control the market .\nBut the broad stroke plan detailed this week doesn \u2019 t just go after these instances .\nIt goes after the entire H-1B program @ @ @ @ @ @ @ workers is once again in this administration \u2019 s playbook .\nYet there is a defensible need by the tech sector for these workers with a majority coming from India .\nShould the visa limits stick , there \u2019 s sure to be reaction from tech businesses .\nThey \u2019 ll ship jobs overseas , disrupting work here and adding to employment rolls elsewhere .\nThat \u2019 s a self-defeating outcome and the very opposite of the announced goals to save American jobs .\nBoth the tech industry lobbying group TechNet and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in against the visa changes .\nThe visa restrictions capture the harsh White House view on immigration : chase away outsiders in the name of self-preservation .\nIn this case , as with other border controls , it \u2019 s illogical and myopic .\nThis country has thrived on arriving talent who supplement the strengths on hand .\nForeign tech workers are no exception and should be welcomed , not spurned .", "author": "", "url":

muddy his political opponent and abandon its historic resistance to getting involved in elections .\nThe president has promoted an unconfirmed New York Post report published last week that cites an

technology for producing energy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pressuring countries to withdraw from a United Nations-backed disarmament treaty is an unprecedented action in international relations , \u201d Fihn said .\n\u201c That the U.S. goes so far as insisting countries violate their treaty obligations by not promoting the TPNW to other states shows how fearful they are of the treaty \u2019 s impact and

the rationale for its bond purchases by saying they would help support the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ during earlier bond purchases that it engineered to bolster the weak recovery from the 2008 financial crisis .\nIn the past , critics have asserted that the Fed 's aggressive bond buying risked destabilizing financial markets and triggering runaway inflation .\nThat has n't happened .\nAnd given the rising threat of another economic setback , many economists say the Fed will eventually increase the size of its bond purchases or shift the mix of those securities to longer-term securities \u2014 or

responsible profiting politically or financially .\nSocial media has produced an \u201c infodemic \u201d , allowing unfounded claims to spread internationally in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people toward more extreme content .\nUndoing the damage caused by anti-vaccination campaigns can take years or decades .\nThough internet companies are belatedly taking some action , more needs to be done .\nYet the

decisions about people \u2019 s lives ; that medical staff can be dismissive of valid concerns ; and indeed that vaccines @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the US , where there is a horrific history of white scientists experimenting on black people without their consent , and ongoing racial discrimination in healthcare , African Americans are much less likely than whites to say they would take a Covid-19 vaccine ,

of potential risks and uncertainties , putting them into context .\nProf Larson argues that anti-vaccine sentiment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sense of dignity or control over their own lives .\nThe last year has exacerbated such emotions , and they will not disappear when lockdowns end .\nRestoring confidence in immunisation may , in the long run , require the much more fundamental rethink that many hoped this pandemic might produce : a reappraisal of who and what is valued , and how we should be living and relating to each other .\nThe New York Times on COVID-19 cases in prisons and jails : As Americans grapple with how \u2014 or whether @ @ @ @ @ @ @ holiday season , the roughly two million people confined in the nation \u2019 s prisons and jails face an even grimmer challenge : how to stay alive inside a system being ravaged by the coronavirus pandemic .\nLike the nation overall , U.S. correctional facilities are experiencing record spikes in coronavirus infections this fall .\nDuring the week of Nov. 17 , there were 13,657 new coronavirus infections reported across the state and federal prison systems , according to the Marshall Project , which has been tracking these numbers since March .\nThe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ These are by far the highest weekly tolls reported since the pandemic began .\nWith winter descending , the situation threatens to grow bleaker still .\nThe American penal system is a perfect breeding ground for the virus .\nSquabbles over mask wearing and social distancing are essentially moot inside overcrowded facilities , many of them old and poorly ventilated , with tight quarters and with hygiene standards that are difficult to maintain .\nUneven testing , inadequate medical resources and the constant churn of staff members , visitors and inmates further speed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disproportionately from comorbidities , such as high blood pressure and asthma , putting them at an elevated risk for complications and death .\nEight months into the pandemic , the precise shape and scope of the devastation remains difficult to pin down .\nBut the available data is heartbreaking .\nAs of mid-November , more than 196,600 coronavirus infections had been reported among state and federal prisoners .\nMore than 1,450 of those prisoners had died .\nThe case rates among inmates are more than four times as high as those of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is more than twice as high .\nInmates are not the only ones trapped with the virus .\nThe correctional system employs more than 685,000 people \u2014 guards , nurses , chaplains and so on .\nThere have been more than 45,470 reported coronavirus infections and 98 deaths among staff members to date .\nTheir case rates are three times as high as for the general public .\nRemember : These are the reported cases .\nThe real numbers are assumed to be higher .\nThe virus ripples outward from these hot spots @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inmates and workers .\nThe coronavirus does not respect prison walls any more than it respects state or national borders .\nIt will not be confined .\nThis spread poses a particular problem for rural communities \u2014 40 percent of prisons are in counties with fewer than 50,000 residents \u2014 which typically lack the health care infrastructure to deal with such outbreaks .\nEven a modest outbreak can quickly overwhelm local hospitals with scant numbers of ventilators and I.C.U .\nbeds .\nLocal jails face additional challenges .\nWhile prisons report much larger @ @ @ @ @ @ @ jails \u2014 where many people are confined for only a few days or even hours \u2014 enables the virus to circulate swiftly between inmates and the larger community , and makes tracking all the more difficult .\nIn a report last month on outbreaks in the Mountain West , The Times noted that in Cascade County , Mont.\n, infections at the local jail made up about a quarter of all known cases in the county .\nOver two months , the facility knowingly released 29 people who were considered actively infected .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ , this is a problem that should have been dealt with more aggressively early on .\nIn the spring , Attorney General Bill Barr was among those calling on correctional facilities to mitigate risk , with a focus on reducing overcrowding through early release and other decarceration measures .\nWhile some progress has been made , it has been uneven and inadequate .\n\u201c Prisons and jails experienced declines in total population ( approximately 11 percent of the incarcerated population ) in the first half of 2020 , \u201d according to a report @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Academies of Sciences , Engineering and Medicine .\nThe report notes that \u201c these reductions appear to be mainly the result of declines in arrests , jail bookings and prison admissions related to lockdowns and the closure of state and local courts.\n\u201d It continues : \u201c The releases among sentenced jail and prison populations that have occurred have , for the most part , occurred on a case-by-case basis and have been procedurally slow and not well suited to crisis situations.\n\u201d While many jails saw a population drop during the first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ numbers of people being held in jails began climbing again over the summer , according to a September briefing by the Prison Policy Initiative , which analyzed 451 county jails .\n\u201c In 88 counties , jail populations are higher now than they were before the pandemic \u201d the briefing notes .\nSome states have taken legislative action to speed the decarceration process .\nA bill signed by New Jersey \u2019 s governor last month permits prisoners with less than a year left on their sentences to be released up to eight months @ @ @ @ @ @ @ release of more than 2,000 people , with another 1,000 or more releases anticipated .\nAll too often , continued foot-dragging or dysfunction by prison officials requires the courts to step in .\nIn the spring and summer , the San Quentin State Prison in California had a major coronavirus outbreak .\nBuilt in the mid 1800s and early 1900s , the outdated facility suffered from overcrowding , inadequate medical staffing , \u201c exceedingly poor ventilation , extraordinarily close living quarters and inadequate sanitation , \u201d according to a panel of medical experts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , who were brought in to assess the situation in June .\nBy late July , the number of active cases had topped 1,600 .\nTents were erected to house the sick .\nBefore the outbreak faded , around 2,200 inmates had confirmed coronavirus infections , and 28 had died .\nIn addition , 298 staff members were infected , resulting in one death .\nThe problem continued to fester .\nIn late October , a state appeals court ruled that the prison authorities \u2019 efforts to address the issue had been insufficient @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cruel and unusual punishment was still being violated .\nTo deal with the emergency , the prison was ordered to cut its population by around half , through a mix of releases and transfers .\n( The original outbreak was sparked by the transfer to San Quentin of infected inmates from another prison . )\nClearly , more needs to be done .\nThe report by the National Academies outlines best practices for reducing the incarcerated population , broken down into short-term and longer-term solutions .\nThe suggested measures start with a systemic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ noncustodial penalties \u201d for minor infractions , including probation and parole violations , and the limiting of pretrial detentions through means such as reducing or eliminating bail .\nIn addition to offering guidance on a bolder decarceration effort , the report stresses the importance of minimizing risks to the families and communities involved , such as \u201c offering testing prior to release , a place to quarantine in the community , and examination of parole and probation policies and procedures.\n\u201d More comprehensive and more standardized testing and reporting requirements are also needed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not a one-and-done effort , the report emphasizes .\nIt is a process requiring \u201c sustained engagement \u201d by a wide array of actors at all levels .\nIt is all too easy for many Americans to ignore the horrors of what is happening inside the nation \u2019 s prisons and jails .\nInmates are isolated from the broader populace , their suffering kept out of sight .\nBut their welfare in this pandemic remains inextricably linked to everyone else \u2019 s .\nThe nation \u2019 s continued failure to bring the virus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ both a public health catastrophe and a moral one .\nThe Houston Chronicle on the fatal shooting of Joshua Jackson by a Harris County Sheriff \u2019 s Office deputy and the lack of public information on cases involving law enforcement shootings : Just before dawn on April 22 , Joshua Johnson was shot and killed near his parents \u2019 home in Missouri City by an undercover Harris County Sheriff \u2019 s Office deputy .\nHours later , standing behind yellow police tape about 200 feet from where the 35-year-old \u2019 s body lay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ answers .\nIn a recorded conversation with Sgt .\nAllen Beall of the sheriff \u2019 s department , Richard Beary , Johnson \u2019 s stepfather , can be heard asking to see his son and why his body is still on the ground .\nBeall gives what would soon become the official story : How Johnson walked up to the unmarked Ford Explorer where a plainclothes deputy sat on the lookout for a murder suspect .\nHow Johnson allegedly tapped on the window holding a BB gun in one hand and his cellphone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other .\nHow he failed to lower the gun when told to and how the deputy opened fire while seated , hitting Johnson at least twice .\nThe family was distraught .\nHow was the narrative \u2014 that Johnson was the victim of bad luck and poor judgment \u2014 already so neat when the medical examiner hadn \u2019 t arrived yet and , as Beall acknowledges in the recording , he hadn \u2019 t even spoken to the deputy involved ?\n\u201c I \u2019 m tired of this BS , y \u2019 all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , his voice breaking .\n\u201c Police for years been shooting Black people for no reason .\nI \u2019 m not going to say , \u2018 y \u2019 all did it , \u2019 but I want to know the facts about my son.\n\u201d Almost seven months later , the family says they \u2019 re still waiting .\nThe sheriff \u2019 s office has completed its investigation but is not disclosing the results .\nA spokesman said that \u2019 s to avoid compromising a separate review by the Harris County District Attorney \u2019 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its findings to a grand jury .\n\u201c We only have one chance , unless there \u2019 s new evidence , to present a case to a grand jury , \u201d district attorney spokesman Dane Schiller told the editorial board .\n\u201c For the family and for the community , we have to get it right.\n\u201d Officials \u2019 decisions to not disclose more information until after a fair and thorough investigation seems reasonable , even if that \u2019 s no comfort to Johnson \u2019 s family .\nDistrict Attorney Kim Ogg \u2019 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ each officer-involved shooting before taking the case to a grand jury has meant true progress in a county where grand juries once cleared officers in shootings some 300 consecutive times .\nIt can be a slow process , given both COVID-related delays and the sheer number of such shootings : 33 this year alone in Harris County , 16 resulting in civilian deaths .\nStill , nearly seven months is a long time for any parent to wait for answers in the death of a child \u2014 or for the community to learn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u2019 s family is understandable and so is the general mistrust in law enforcement these days given the nauseating pattern of police brutality and deaths in custody across the country .\nJohnson \u2019 s family has launched its own investigation and found support from U.S .\nCongressman Al Green .\nSo far , they have interviewed neighbors and gathered evidence that seems to contradict what officials said happened .\nThey point to neighbor testimony that places the deputy \u2019 s vehicle in a vacant lot several houses over from where the shooting occurred @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that struck a neighbor \u2019 s garage .\nThey wonder if the deputy identified himself .\nThey ask how a mortally wounded Johnson managed to hold on to his BB gun and cellphone as he stumbled back to his car , where he was found by police .\n\u201c They have their theory , \u201d Green said of the sheriff \u2019 s office , \u201c but it doesn \u2019 t seem to coincide with the facts.\n\u201d The family also notes that in 2015 , the deputy who shot Johnson , Tu Tran @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , killed an armed man outside a Houston nightclub while working security .\nA grand jury declined to indict in the shooting .\nThe deputy was later suspended without pay in 2017 after a video showed him striking a handcuffed suspect in the throat after a vehicle chase .\nSheriff Ed Gonzalez met with the family several times and tried to address their concerns , said spokesman Jason Spencer .\nTran is back on active duty .\nSpencer said that except in rare cases , any disciplinary action and disclosure of an investigation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ jury has its say .\nThe skepticism of Johnson \u2019 s family is supported by a long history , in Harris County and elsewhere , of covering up police wrongdoing when it comes to the deaths of civilians , especially Black men .\nThat \u2019 s why each of these cases deserves our attention and vigilance as a community .\nWe have to stop , take notice , and listen when families raise the kinds of concerns that officials and the media used to ignore .\nWe urge agencies investigating to do so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ transparency as possible .\nBut we also have to give law enforcement officials time to do their jobs .\nWe also note that both Ogg and Gonzalez have a record of holding law enforcement accountable .\nThe sheriff fired Deputy Chauna Thompson in 2017 after she helped restrain a man while her husband choked him to death and dismissed Deputy Cameron Brewer after a deadly shooting in 2018 .\nDuring Ogg \u2019 s tenure , six Houston Police officers have been indicted over the botched Harding Street raid , including two counts of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nWe implore Gonzalez and Ogg to show the same integrity in Johnson \u2019 s case , and to never forget that somewhere in each of these cases , there \u2019 s a grieving family who \u2019 s skeptical ,

speed : a \u201c race \u201d to approval , \u201c Operation Warp Speed \u201d and the truly record-breaking timelines .\nBut speed is not the only remarkable aspect of the process that will soon result in vaccines reaching tens of millions of Americans .\nThe first two that are expected to receive emergency use authorization from the Food @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Moderna , rely on an extraordinary advance in technology , never before used on such a scale , with great promise for the future , and some uncertainties .\nIn the past , vaccines were largely based on an inactivated or weakened form of a pathogen that was used to train the body \u2019 s immune system to fight an infection .\nSuch vaccines have been remarkably successful in fighting diseases such as measles and polio , but they have also taken many years and sometimes decades to develop .\nBy contrast , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a tiny piece of synthesized genetic material known as messenger RNA .\nIn nature , mRNA serves to convey instructions inscribed in DNA and deliver them to the protein-making parts of a cell .\nThe new vaccines use the synthesized mRNA to deliver instructions to the cell to produce the spike protein that the coronavirus uses to latch on to a cell and infect it .\nWhen the spike proteins are produced by the cell \u2014 on instruction from the mRNA \u2014 they then train the body \u2019 s immune system

Johnson reported Monday , scientists have known since 1961 about mRNA , but exploiting it for medicine was a complex task .\nOne of the early problems was that , when injected , it could cause an inflammatory reaction .\nBut Katalin Kariko and Drew Weissman , working at the University of Pennsylvania , figured out in 2005 how to modify the mRNA so that the body did not react with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ paving the way for today \u2019 s vaccines .\nA second hurdle that vexed scientists was how to fortify the fragile mRNA particles for delivery to the cell .\nThe solution was to encase it in small bubbles of fat known as lipid nanoparticles .\nOne of the most promising outcomes of the research is the development of nucleic acid-based \u201c platforms \u201d that may be reused to design vaccines for different diseases , starting as soon as the genetic sequence of a pathogen is known , and also using processes that are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an outbreak .\nSo far , clinical trials suggest that the vaccines are safe and provide protection from covid-19 , but longer-term monitoring of those who get the vaccine is essential .\nHow long will the immunity last ?\nAre there unknown side effects , in particular for people with immune system disorders ?\nFortunately , other vaccines using more traditional methods also are nearing readiness .\nGiven the catastrophic scope of the pandemic , every vaccine that works will be needed , down to the very last dose .\nThe Houston Chronicle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the first person to break the sound barrier : In his 1979 book about the pilots who would become

moving to Idaho in September , Duncan discussed the shooting of protesters with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ around Black Lives Matter rallies in Boise , the indictment says .\nLess than a month later , FBI agents notified two BLM movement co-founders that their names were on a list kept by a different paramilitary group member .\nA federal magistrate judge refused Thursday to release Duncan from custody after hearing a prosecutor describe the former Marine as a potentially violent man whose parents didn \u2019 t know about his white supremacist and anti-Semitic ideology .\n\u201c You effectively hid this

leading up to the election , \u201d she said .\n\u201c It \u2019 s not a way to live to know that the work that you \u2019 re doing is about changing the country to be better and that there are people that are willing to threaten your life.\n\u201d John @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Naval Criminal Investigative Service , acknowledged Wednesday that he had n't seen evidence of Duncan attending rallies .\nBut he testified that Duncan tried to persuade at least one other group member to attend a rally either supporting gay people or another minority group .\nAssistant U.S. Attorney Barbara Kocher showed the judge a 90-second video that she said shows Duncan firing gunshots and participating in military-style exercises .\nIn the recruitment video , Duncan and three other members flashed \u201c Heil Hitler \u201d salutes while wearing skull masks associated with a neo-Nazi @ @ @ @ @ @ @ says .\nA hate symbol was in the background in reference to the perpetrator of the 2019 mass shootings at mosques in

of the video .\nDefense attorney Raymond Tarlton said Duncan is n't a danger to the public or a flight risk .\n\u201c He has every incentive to stay here and fight the good fight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ s father , Frank , is a Pennsylvania Baptist pastor who offered to house his son while awaiting trial .\n\u201c I \u2019 ve heard a lot of detail today , \u201d Frank Duncan said Wednesday after hearing testimony about his son .\n\u201c Probably more than I wanted to.\n\u201d The indictment says Duncan , Kryscuk , 21-year-old Liam Collins and 21-year-old Justin Hermanson intended for their illegally manufactured guns to be unlawfully used \u201c in furtherance of a civil disorder.\n\u201d Collins , Duncan and Kryscuk were arrested on Oct. 20 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ served in the Marines from 2013 to 2018 .\nCollins , who was separated from the military in September , also had been at Camp Lejeune .\nHermanson , an active-duty Marine , was assigned to the same unit as Collins .\nKryscuk moved from New York to Boise early this year .\nHe had previously appeared in porn videos under the name \u201c Pauly Harker , \u201d according to the NCIS agent .\nLittle said Kryscuk engaged in \u201c hate porn

"content": "MIAMI -- President Donald Trump announced Wednesday that Navy ships are being moved toward Venezuela as his administration beefs up counter-narcotics operations in the Caribbean following a U.S. drug indictment against Nicol\u00e1s Maduro .\nThe president 's announcement was a break from the daily White House press briefing to discuss the coronavirus pandemic , which has left much of the country in lock-down and which the government warns could cause 100,000 to 240,000 deaths .\n\u201c The Venezuelan people continue to suffer tremendously due to Maduro and his criminal control over the country , and drug traffickers are seizing on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Esper said after the president 's announcement .\nThe mission involves sending additional Navy warships , surveillance aircraft and special forces teams to nearly double the U.S. counter-narcotics capacity in the Western Hemisphere , with forces operating both in the Caribbean and eastern Pacific .\nEsper said the mission would be supported by 22 partner nations .\n\u201c As governments and nations focus on the coronavirus there is a growing threat that cartels , criminals , terrorists and other malign actors will try to exploit the situation for their own gain , \u201d @ @ @ @ @ @ @ let that happen . ''\nThe enhanced mission has been months in the making but has taken on greater urgency following last week 's indictment of Maduro , Venezuela 's embattled socialist leader , and members of his inner circle and military .\nThey are accused of leading a narcoterrorist conspiracy responsible for smuggling up to 250 metric tons of cocaine a year into the U.S. , about half of it by sea .\n\u201c If I was just indicted for drug trafficking by the United States , with a $ 15 million @ @ @ @ @ @ @ U.S. Navy conducting anti-drug operations off my coast would be something I would worry about , '' said Sen. Marco Rubio , a Florida Republican who has been among those calling for a tougher stance against Maduro .\nIt also comes as Maduro steps up attacks on his U.S.-backed rival , Juan Guaid\u00f3 .\nMaduro \u2019 s chief prosecutor ordered Guaid\u00f3 to provide testimony Thursday as part of an investigation into an alleged coup attempt .\nGuaid\u00f3 , the head of Venezuela 's congress who is recognized as his country 's legitimate leader @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nations , is unlikely to show up , raising the possibility he could be arrested .\nThe U.S. has long insisted it will not tolerate any harm against Guaido .\n\u201c No matter where you sit ideologically , any move to try to bring democracy back to Venezuela requires first recognizing the criminal nature of the Maduro regime , and making moves that scare the regime into negotiating , '' said Raul Gallegos , a Bogota , Colombia-based director in the Andean region for Control Risks , a consulting group .\nMaduro has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a $ 15 million reward for his arrest , calling it the work of a \u201c racist cowboy \u201d aimed at getting U.S. hands on Venezuela \u2019 s vast oil reserves , the world 's largest .\nHe also points out that the vast majority of cocaine leaves South America from Colombia , a staunch U.S. ally .\nOthers have faulted a U.S. plan , unveiled Tuesday by Secretary of State Mike Pompeo , to create a five-member council without Maduro or Guaid\u00f3 to govern the country until elections can be held @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first attempt in months by the U.S. to seek a negotiated solution to Venezuela 's stalemate , coming on the heels of the indictments many say it has little hope of succeeding and likely to drive Maduro farther away from the path of dialogue .\nThe Trump administration has long insisted that all options are on the table for removing Maduro , including military ones .\nStill , there \u2019 s no indication then , or now , that any sort of U.S. invasion is being planned .\nRather , the sending of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the U.S. Southern Command for additional assets to combat growing antinarcotics and other security threats in the hemisphere .\nIn January , another Navy vessel , the USS Detroit , conducted a freedom of navigation operation off the coast of Venezuela in a show of pressure against Maduro .\n\u201c That presence sends a big statement about U.S. commitment , it sends a big statement to our friends , it reassures them , and then to our adversaries that those are capable performers , \u201d Adm. Craig Faller , the head of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in congressional testimony last month .\nThe report of the planned deployment comes two days after one of Venezuela 's naval patrol boats sank after colliding with a Portuguese-flagged cruise ship near the Venezuelan-controlled island of La Tortuga .\nMaduro accused the ship of acting aggressively and said it was possibly carrying \u201c mercenaries \u201d seeking his ouster .\n\u201c You have to be very naive to see this as an isolated incident , \u201d Maduro said Tuesday night on state TV .\nBut Columbia Cruise Services , the operator of the cruise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gunshots and than purposely rammed into the liner at speed .\nThere were no passengers on board and none of its 32 crew members were injured , the company said .", "author": "", "url": "https://abcnews.go.com/US/wireStory/ap-sources-us-deploy-anti-drug-ships-venezuela-69921867", "published": "Wed, 01 Apr 2020 18:30:28 -0400", "published_utc": 1585780228, "collection_utc": 1585782028}, {"id": "abcnews--2020-04-03--10 Things to Know for Today", "date": "2020-04-03", "source": "abcnews", "title": "10 Things to Know for Today", "content": "Your daily look at late-breaking news , upcoming events and the stories that will be talked about today : 1 .\nVIRUS DEATHS , UNEMPLOYMENT ACCELERATING Coronavirus deaths mount in Spain , Italy and New York , while the outbreak throws 10 million Americans out of work in just two weeks and sickens more than a million people .\n2 .\n\u2018 WE NEED HELP \u2019 Funeral directors in New York City are facing unprecedented demand due to the coronavirus pandemic with AP witnessing 185 bodies stacked up in one funeral home \u2014 triple the normal capacity .\n3 .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ PEAK Britain \u2019 s National Health Service is facing the biggest test in its 72-year history as the government races to ensure medical facilities have the staffing and equipment they need .\n4 .\nWANTED : COVID-19 SURVIVOR \u2019 S BLOOD Without proof that it works , doctors want to use blood plasma from recovered coronavirus patients to treat the sick , giving them a dose of the immune system antibodies that fight the virus .\n5 .\nTRUMP-PELOSI RELATIONSHIP REMAINS BROKEN The president and House speaker have not spoken in five months @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the U.S. government \u2019 s ability to respond to the growing coronavirus pandemic .\n6 .\nISRAELI ULTRA-ORTHODOX HIT HARD BY VIRUS After ignoring weeks of pleas to avoid large gatherings and to stay at home , the religious city of Bnei Brak in central Israel emerges as the worst hot spot of infections .\n7 .\nRECORD HIRING STREAK IN JEOPARDY The U.S. government \u2019 s monthly jobs report is expected to show that the American jobs machine came to a sudden halt in March as a result of the coronavirus .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ WISCONSIN ELECTION A federal judge blasts state leaders \u2019 decision not to delay the election to protect people \u2019 s health but refuses to postpone it himself , ordering an extension for absentee voting .\n9 .\n\u2018 COFFEE & KAREEM \u2019 A LEWD BUDDY COP COMEDY A new Netflix film puts a daffy police officer together with a potty-mouthed pre-teen on a series of crazy hijinks in Detroit .\n10 .\nSPRINGFIELD MAY CALL RUDY T San Antonio Spurs coach Gregg Popovich says it \u2019 s \u201c long overdue \u201d that former @ @ @ @ @ @ @ call from the Basketball Hall of Fame .", "author": "", "url": "https://abcnews.go.com/US/wireStory/10-things-today-69954506", "published": "Fri, 03 Apr 2020 05:50:07 -0400", "published_utc": 1585907407, "collection_utc": 1585911620}]
